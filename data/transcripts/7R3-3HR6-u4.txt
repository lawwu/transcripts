[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.220]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.060]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.900]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.380]   Today, my guest is Dr. Sachin Panda.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.540]   Dr. Sachin Panda is a professor
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.960]   and director of the Regulatory Biology Laboratory
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.940]   at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies.
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.500]   His laboratory has made numerous important contributions
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.820]   that impact mental health, physical health,
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.420]   and human performance.
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.460]   For instance, his laboratory discovered
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.620]   the neurons in the eye and neurons within the brain
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.820]   that regulate our so-called circadian rhythms.
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.040]   Circadian rhythms are 24-hour rhythms
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.420]   in everything from gene expression
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.640]   to the overall functioning of tissues,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.020]   our levels of mood and alertness,
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.360]   our ability to sleep, appetite, and much, much more.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.780]   In addition, over the last decade,
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.020]   Dr. Panda's laboratory has made critical discoveries
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.380]   in terms of how our patterns of eating over time
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.720]   impact our biology and our health.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.280]   In particular, his laboratory pioneered discoveries
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.580]   related to so-called intermittent fasting,
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.260]   also sometimes referred to as time-restricted feeding.
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.800]   Today, Dr. Panda and I discuss how our circadian behaviors,
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.660]   everything from when we wake up to when we view light
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.600]   to when we avoid viewing light
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.860]   to when we eat and what we eat
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.420]   and when we socialize and how we socialize
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.520]   impacts our biology and our psychology
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.820]   and how all of that has a strong impact on our health.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.800]   During today's discussion,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.700]   you will learn how restricting your feeding
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.120]   to specific periods within each 24-hour cycle
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.340]   or perhaps even exploring longer patterns of fasting
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.120]   and eating cycles can impact everything
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.420]   from the health of your liver to your gut to your brain
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.680]   and how all of that impacts things like mood
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.020]   and your ability to perform cognitive work.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.000]   Indeed, today's discussion goes deep
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.420]   into all aspects of intermittent fasting,
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.420]   AKA time-restricted feeding.
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.520]   We talk about the basic science
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.660]   as well as the recent clinical trials
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.660]   that have explored time-restricted feeding
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.640]   in a diverse range of people,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.880]   including men, women, children, people with diabetes,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.820]   people who are otherwise healthy and much, much more.
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.300]   I'm quite aware that intermittent fasting
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.720]   is a topic of much debate these days.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.080]   We go deep into that debate
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.880]   and by the end of today's discussion,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.080]   you can be certain that you will have learned
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.620]   all the latest and all the details,
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.020]   all made very clear to you
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.820]   thanks to the incredible expertise, discovery,
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.320]   and clear communication of Dr. Panda.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.660]   As some of you may already know,
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.240]   Dr. Panda has authored several important books
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.920]   on the topic of intermittent fasting
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.080]   and how it can benefit various aspects of health.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.200]   Those books include "The Circadian Code"
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.460]   and a more recent book, "The Circadian Diabetes Code,"
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.120]   both of which we've provided links to
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.920]   in the show note captions.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.400]   In addition, if any of you are interested
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.160]   in learning more about Dr. Panda's work,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.580]   including seeing his publications and reading
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.100]   those publications or supporting his laboratory,
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.800]   you can do that by going to his laboratory website,
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.340]   which we have also linked in the show note captions.
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.960]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.640]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.780]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.660]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.480]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.860]   to the general public.
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.860]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.620]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.820]   Our first sponsor is HVMN Ketone IQ.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.160]   HVMN Ketone IQ is a supplement that increases blood ketones.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.340]   I want to be clear that I am not following a ketogenic diet.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.940]   Most people fall into this category.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.840]   They are not following a ketogenic diet.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.440]   They are omnivores and they do eat carbohydrates.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.340]   So their standard fuel source for the brain and body
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.740]   is not ketones.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.220]   However, I found that by taking Ketone IQ,
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.600]   which we know increases blood ketones,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.620]   I can achieve much better focus for longer periods of time
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.880]   for any kind of cognitive work
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.320]   and much greater energy levels for exercise,
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.100]   especially if I'm going into that exercise fasted
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.940]   and find myself a little bit hungry
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.600]   when I start that exercise.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.620]   And this is no surprise.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.520]   We know that ketones are the brain's
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.480]   and body's preferred fuel source,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.080]   even if you're not following a ketogenic diet.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.560]   So in other words, I and many other people
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.780]   are now starting to leverage endogenous ketones
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.680]   as a fuel source for the brain and body,
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.760]   and yet we are not following a ketogenic diet.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.520]   And of course, if you are following a ketogenic diet,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.760]   Ketone IQ will further allow you
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.040]   to increase your blood ketones
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.220]   as a source of brain and body fuel.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.720]   If you'd like to try Ketone IQ,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.480]   you can go to hvmn.com/huberman
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.280]   to save 20% off your order.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.240]   Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.040]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.720]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.880]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.400]   As I've talked about before on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.040]   there is a critical relationship
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.920]   between sleep and body temperature.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.340]   That is, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep,
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.820]   your body temperature needs to drop
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.460]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.080]   And in order to wake up in the morning and feel alert,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.800]   your body temperature needs to increase
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.000]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.320]   The problem with most people's sleeping environment
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.280]   is that even if you make the room cool,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.000]   the actual environment that you sleep on,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.460]   that is your mattress and underneath your covers,
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.920]   is hard to regulate in terms of temperature.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.760]   With Eight Sleep, regulating the temperature
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.160]   of that sleeping environment becomes incredibly easy.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.280]   In fact, you can change the temperature of that environment
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.640]   across the night, making it a little bit cool
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.040]   at the beginning of the night,
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.320]   even cooler still a few hours into your sleep,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.680]   which really helps getting into very deep sleep,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.120]   and then warming it as you approach morning
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.480]   so that you wake up feeling most alert.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.600]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.040]   for over a year now,
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.400]   and it has completely transformed my sleep.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.660]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.680]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.600]   to save up to $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.440]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.720]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.480]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.060]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.400]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.480]   Now, I am not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.120]   because it translates to smart drugs.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.840]   And as a neuroscientist, what I can tell you
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.080]   is that you have circuits in your brain
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.440]   that allow you to focus,
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.380]   you have circuits in your brain
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.660]   that allow you to be creative,
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.540]   you have circuits in your brain
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.080]   that allow you to task switch, and on and on.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.560]   In other words, there is no specific brain circuit
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.900]   or even circuits for being quote unquote smart.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.800]   Thesis understands this and has developed nootropics
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.460]   that are customized to different types of mental operations.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.440]   What do I mean by that?
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.080]   Well, they have formulas that can put your brain
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.880]   into a state of increased clarity, or focus, or creativity,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.000]   or that can give you more overall energy
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.460]   for things like physical exercise.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.600]   I often take the thesis clarity formula
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.040]   prior to long bouts of cognitive work
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.720]   and I'll use their energy formula
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.380]   prior to doing any kind of really intense physical exercise.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.220]   If you'd like to try
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.080]   your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.200]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.920]   You'll take a brief three minute quiz
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.180]   and thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.840]   to try in your first month.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.320]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.120]   And if you use the code Huberman at checkout,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.100]   you'll get 10% off your order.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.240]   The Huberman Lab podcast
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.080]   is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.400]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.120]   on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to Live Momentous,
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.600]   spelled O-U-S, livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.200]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.360]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.520]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.960]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Sachin Panda.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.280]   Sachin, Dr. Panda, so good to see you again.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.320]   - Yeah, good to see you.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.360]   - We are colleagues still,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.520]   but we used to be right across the street from one another.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.360]   - Yeah, I remember those days, yeah.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.760]   - Yeah, so I'm delighted that you're here.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.860]   I think we're going to talk about a number of things,
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.100]   mainly intermittent fasting,
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.580]   time-restricted feeding and health,
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.280]   but also the many other things that you're doing.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.160]   Just before we started recording,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.040]   we were discussing your recent paper in Nature
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.960]   that involved recordings from post-mortem human retina.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.820]   So maybe if there's time at the end, we can get back to.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.120]   Your lab has shown that it can essentially maintain
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.020]   or resurrect neurons from dead people
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.840]   in order to potentially and eventually provide transplants
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.340]   to rescue vision in the blind.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.040]   So that's extremely exciting.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.320]   But of course, not the main focus of today's discussion,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.300]   so we'll have to split it up.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.960]   The first question I have is how am I supposed to define
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.360]   fasting and time-restricted feeding?
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.600]   Meaning when I go to sleep every night, I'm not eating.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.580]   So in some sense, everybody is doing time-restricted feeding
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.120]   to some degree or another.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.640]   At what point can we start thinking about
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.980]   a pattern of eating as time-restricted feeding,
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.060]   so-called intermittent fasting?
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.160]   Does it have to do with how regular one is
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.540]   about the start and stop times?
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.980]   How do you think about defining intermittent fasting,
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.960]   time-restricted feeding,
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.200]   and maybe just to simplify the conversation,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.380]   is one term more correct than the other
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.120]   in terms of describing this incredible pattern of feeding?
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.060]   - Well, you know that intermittent fasting
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.840]   covers many types of fasting.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.300]   Actually, it started a long time ago,
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.300]   and it's embedded into the history of caloric restriction.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.200]   Almost 100 years ago, people showed that
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.480]   if you reduce calorie intake in a rat,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.420]   then that rat can live for a long time.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.700]   And in those experiments,
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.020]   the calories were reduced every single day.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.480]   And that led to the idea that if we cut down our calories
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.480]   by 20% say, then we can potentially live longer
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.440]   by doing two things.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.260]   One is preventing a related disease,
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.260]   or even if we fall sick, maybe we can accelerate cure
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.460]   and keep the repair mechanism going
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.940]   so that we can live longer.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:56.620]   But it was very difficult to count calories every day
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.500]   and reduce, maintain that.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.980]   I must say that it's not that calorie restriction
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.820]   is impossible or we are not doing it.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.820]   In fact, a lot of us, we do count calories
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.680]   in our subconscious mind.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.240]   And so every time we take out a soda bottle or something,
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.300]   I'm looking at it, okay, 160 kilocal,
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.500]   30 kilocal, or zero kilocal, we are doing that.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.220]   So the point is we are doing subconsciously
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.900]   some kind of calorie counting,
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.760]   but reducing calorie by 20, 30% every single day
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.440]   is not possible for many people.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.880]   So then the idea came in mouse and rat experiment,
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.820]   whether they can eat every other day.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:46.780]   And in fact, this every other day feeding
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.220]   also led to very similar,
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.400]   almost equivalent health improvement
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.600]   as continuous calorie restriction.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.060]   So then the idea was, well,
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.480]   every other day is a little bit hard for humans,
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.540]   but just imagine I would just get to eat
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.340]   only one day and then another day.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.800]   Then the idea came, well, for humans,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.560]   can they eat less for one or two days in a week?
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.460]   So that led to this 5-2 diet
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.380]   where people can eat for five days
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.300]   and then two days they have to reduce calories.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.540]   So that's also, intermittently people are fasting.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.940]   Then as you know, Walter Longo also came with this idea
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.320]   that periodic fasting, maybe four or five days
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.620]   in every month or two months, three months,
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.280]   you can fast or reduce calorie.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.840]   And he also found many benefits
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.420]   of calorie restriction was there.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.600]   - Were those studies on humans?
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.080]   - Many of the studies started in mice,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.080]   but alternate day fasting, 5-2 and Walter's periodic fasting,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.020]   all of them have now been done in humans,
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.420]   not for longevity, of course,
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.480]   because you cannot do those for a long time,
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.820]   but for weight maintenance,
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.820]   for reducing some signs of aging or reversing,
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.760]   those things have been done.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.580]   So all of them have been done in humans,
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.860]   mostly healthy humans, and in some cases,
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.100]   people with prediabetes or some aspects of metabolic disease.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.100]   So that led to the idea that all these forms of fasting
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:25.260]   in which the total calorie can take on any given day
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.660]   is reduced for one or more days in a week, a month,
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.520]   that umbrella term became intermittent fasting.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.540]   So if you look up the scientific literature,
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.980]   most intermittent fasting involves
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.180]   intentionally reducing calories
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.980]   for at least one or two days in a week
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.940]   or a few days in a month.
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.420]   So when we published time restricted feeding,
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.220]   the initial mouse experiments,
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.040]   and even now most of the mouse experiments,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.460]   we want to test what is the impact of time restriction
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.660]   versus calorie restriction.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.660]   So in these experiments,
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.080]   we don't reduce calorie on any day of mouse life.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.940]   So the mice eat the same number of calories
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.760]   as the ad libitum fed mice,
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.040]   but still they see health benefit.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.820]   So that's why we call it time restricted feeding.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.820]   But since it involves living without food for several hours,
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.460]   for some people, which is, it can be very difficult.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.700]   The initial experiments was done,
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.680]   they were done for eight hours of feeding
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.700]   and 16 hours of fasting.
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.600]   That kind of became popular.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.100]   And so that's why people use the same term
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.460]   as intermittent fasting.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.780]   And now if you say intermittent fasting
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.260]   in popular literature or popular media,
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.640]   then people usually refer to time restricted eating.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.920]   So now coming back to how do you define
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.160]   time restricted feeding?
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.680]   So the way we have been trying to define experimentally
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   and also in literature is trying to confine
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:15.440]   all your energy intake from solid and liquid food combined
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.880]   within a consistent window of eight to 12 hours,
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.400]   because that's something that's doable.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.520]   Of course, people have done time restricted feeding
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.120]   with four hours, six hours,
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.940]   and some people even try to eat everything
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.880]   within two hours, one meal a day.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.700]   But the point is those are not feasible
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.740]   to maintain for a very long time for a lot of people.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:42.020]   - One question about the six hour versus eight hour
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.700]   versus 12 hour feeding window.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.780]   Is it important that the feeding window
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.940]   begin and end at the same time more or less?
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.780]   - Yeah, more or less.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.420]   - And if so, how much flexibility is there?
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.920]   So for instance, I'm somebody that
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.260]   I am not terribly hungry in the morning.
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.360]   I like to drink water, usually some caffeine
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.780]   and electrolytes in the period before my first meal.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.460]   And my first meal always lands sometime
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.620]   between 11 a.m. and 12 noon.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.180]   There are exceptions occasionally.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.340]   I'll have a breakfast, a proper breakfast as it's called.
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.380]   I guess it would be improper
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.520]   if you're intermittent fasting for me.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.420]   But typically 11 a.m. or noon is when I first eat.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.600]   And my last bite of food is typically around,
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.700]   I don't know, 8, 39 p.m.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.940]   That's what works for me.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.380]   Is that consistency affording me any benefit?
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.720]   And let's just leave aside total caloric number,
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.020]   macronutrients, plant-based meat, et cetera.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.500]   But is there any benefit to shortening that feeding window
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.100]   that we are aware of or extending that feeding window
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.540]   or being even more rigid about the start
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.100]   and end of that feeding window?
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.140]   - Yeah, so the start of the feeding window,
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:02.320]   that's interesting because the concept of timeless feeding,
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.300]   when I describe animal studies,
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.460]   it's feeding for humans, it's eating.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.640]   So the concept actually came from the science
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.820]   of circadian rhythm.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.820]   So that means our body has an internal timetable
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.820]   that's present in every cell, in every organ
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:26.980]   that pre-programs many molecular aspects of the cells
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.300]   that leads to physiology and all that stuff.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.860]   So that essentially there is a predetermined timetable
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.660]   for every cell, every organ to do certain things
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.240]   at certain time.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   And the circadian clocks, as you and I know,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.120]   are more sensitive to light.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.660]   Light is the most dominant time giver.
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.120]   So for example, when daylight seven time changes
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.720]   or when we travel from one time zone to another time zone,
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.020]   we feel kind of crappy because our daily activities
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.860]   are out of sync from our internal clock.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.500]   So that was known for a very long time,
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.380]   but then around the year 2000, 2002,
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:19.340]   there was a famous experiment by Uli Sibler from Switzerland.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.900]   What he did, he just fed the mice at the wrong time.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.140]   Mice are nocturnal, they're night feeders.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.280]   And when he fed the mice during their time,
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.480]   the liver clock, instead of following its own routine,
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.120]   liver clock actually started following food.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.080]   So that means by changing our feeding time,
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.280]   we can change, we can tune our liver clock.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.760]   And subsequently the same experiment
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.580]   has been repeated many times,
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.340]   and we repeated that in 2009.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:57.340]   And we figured out, yes, actually outside this brain center
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.160]   called suprachiasmatic nucleus or SCN,
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.820]   which is considered the master circadian clock,
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:11.700]   almost the rest of the brain even follows when we eat.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.240]   And that came out from Pierre Chambon's lab in Europe,
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.380]   where they systematically looked at even places
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.980]   that are very close to the SCN.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.620]   For those who know, there are some medial hypothalamus
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.460]   or paraventricular nucleus, all of this,
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.960]   within a couple of four or five millimeters of the SCN,
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.020]   but they were following food cue.
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.840]   - Amazing.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.340]   - So then, now if we think about it,
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.700]   so for example, when the daylight seven time changes,
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.440]   just one hour change,
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.100]   or one hour change in alignment between our internal time
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.940]   and external time,
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.940]   leads to kind of feeling groggy
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.500]   and feeling not at a peak performance for one or two days.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.540]   So the rule of thumb is when the time giver
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.580]   changes by one hour,
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.700]   then our internal clock takes at least a day to catch up.
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.700]   So that means if you're flying from LA to New York,
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.060]   you're moving through three time zones,
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.920]   then on an hour is it will take three days
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.380]   to catch up with the New York time.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.940]   For some people it can be even slower,
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.040]   and for some people it can be two days,
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.500]   but the bottom line is, yes, there is a desynchrony.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.900]   So then what does it mean for the body?
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.160]   So one of the function of clock is to anticipate
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.060]   when you're going to wake up, for example,
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.260]   so the blood pressure slightly goes up,
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.060]   our heart rate goes up, our breathing goes up.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.040]   Similarly for food,
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.520]   almost every organ that is involved in feeding
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.200]   or eating digestion, all of them have clocks.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.420]   So even from saliva production,
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:03.120]   that is the first phase of digestion
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.920]   to secretion of all the digestive juice in the stomach
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.440]   and then absorption of nutrient and liver metabolism,
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.560]   everything, the whole village expects
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.720]   when you're supposed to eat,
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   and they're getting ready for you to eat the first meal
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.980]   after fasting for a long time.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.480]   So that's why it's breaking the fast of breakfast.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.080]   And when that time changes,
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.900]   when you change it by two or three hours
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.240]   from one day to another, then sometimes they're like,
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.920]   "Oh, food didn't come."
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.000]   Maybe it will come at a wrong time.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.600]   We were at the wrong time,
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.380]   and then they'll track the new eating times.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.960]   So suppose that one day you have been eating every day
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.200]   at 8 a.m., no, I ate at 8 a.m.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.520]   - Is that when you start your feeding window?
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.300]   When does your feeding window shut?
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.200]   - 6 p.m., so I eat for around 10 hours.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.040]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.960]   And then one day, if I switch to 10 a.m.,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.040]   then what happens is a clock is thinking,
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.000]   "Well, the food didn't arrive at eight,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.200]   but it arrived at 10."
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.840]   Maybe tomorrow the food will arrive
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.360]   somewhere between eight and 10,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.960]   so it will be ready around nine.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:17.480]   So then the next day, if I come back and eat at eight o'clock
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.480]   and I may eat, but my clock is not ready to digest that food,
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.520]   so that's why this idea is you have to be consistent
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.560]   to take advantage of this anticipatory activity
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.360]   of a clock in different systems to get the best out of it.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.760]   - Is there evidence that those anticipatory systems,
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.480]   as they relate to digestion,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.360]   help us better assimilate our food?
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.200]   I would imagine so.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.680]   I mean, if you have the gastric juices
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.680]   that are gonna help digest the proteins, fats,
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.440]   and carbohydrates, and already deployed
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.640]   at the time when you eat,
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.960]   I could imagine that food will be better utilized
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.840]   than if you don't.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.080]   So in other words, what is the advantage
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.720]   of having these anticipatory signals
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.960]   in terms of potential health benefits?
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   - The anticipatory signal is really important
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.800]   even from waking up.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.880]   The reason why many people feel not ready completely
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.600]   when they wake up to an alarm clock,
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.080]   because the alarm clock wakes you up,
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.760]   but your body is not prepared,
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.360]   so that sleepiness after waking up to an alarm clock
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.760]   is due to our body is not prepared for that.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   And then the best example is when the daylight saving time
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.520]   changes, particularly when we have to wake up one hour early,
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.360]   what happens?
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.900]   People who have underlying heart condition,
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.920]   when they're waking up, when the body is not ready,
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.880]   your heart is not ready,
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.960]   and all of a sudden the heart has to start pumping
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.360]   a little bit harder,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.360]   then there is chance of heart attack.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.440]   And in fact, people have looked at hospital records
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.160]   and they find that on those days,
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.120]   there is a sharp rise in heart attacks.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.080]   - And car accidents, right?
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.200]   - And car accidents too,
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.960]   because your brain is not coordinated,
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.720]   so you cannot make those fine decisions.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   So that's a great example of anticipatory activity.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.880]   But coming back to digestion, one thing is,
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.240]   and this is something that many people
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.320]   might have experienced.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.560]   There are many rhythms in our digestive system,
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.040]   and one of the rhythms is our intestine
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.160]   has this peristaltic function,
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.720]   so it kind of contracts and expands,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.640]   and that moves food, food doesn't move due to gravity,
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.880]   so it goes back and forth.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.360]   And that peristaltic action actually slows down at night.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.480]   Few hours after our last meal.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.480]   And so that's why when people eat late at night,
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.320]   for example, then that food doesn't get digested
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.720]   because there is not enough digestive juice, first thing.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.240]   And second, even if it gets digested in the stomach,
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.000]   it doesn't move properly.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.960]   So then the next morning people get up and think,
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.160]   of course, people consume some alcohol very often,
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.120]   and then they think that this is hangover,
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.440]   but those who don't consume alcohol,
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.360]   then they have the food hangover because it doesn't digest.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.800]   So that's one extreme example where food at the wrong time,
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.400]   so healthy food at the wrong time can be crap or junk.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.560]   - Yeah, I've experienced that where if I've worked late
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.720]   or I couldn't eat dinner or something and then I get home,
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.920]   I always debate whether or not to try and sleep.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.320]   But if I'm too hungry, oftentimes it's challenging.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.880]   And so for me, sometimes consuming something
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.760]   that at least seems easily digestible like yogurt
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.440]   or something in a liquid form is better for me
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.960]   than if I eat a meal.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.760]   I've made the mistake of going to the refrigerator,
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.640]   being super hungry and eating a bunch of food
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.160]   at 10 or 11 p.m. and then falling asleep.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.000]   And indeed the sleep, if I'm tired enough,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.880]   can be quite deep, but the next morning I feel
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.280]   just completely physically and cognitively weighed down.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.960]   So I think that what you just described
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.880]   makes a lot of sense.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.880]   So if someone were to select a feeding window,
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.080]   regardless of whether or not it falls
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.620]   into classic intermittent fasting, time restricted feeding,
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.520]   sounds like eating your first bite of food
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.520]   and eating your last bite of food
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.860]   at more or less the same time each day has benefits.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.480]   I have this question, you mentioned feeding versus eating,
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.080]   and I think it's actually not just
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.960]   a grammatical semantic issue.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.760]   And here's why.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.140]   We tend to think about when you take your first bite of food
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.100]   and then when you take your last bite of food,
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.880]   but of course, food's digested different rates,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.680]   more fat in there is going to digest,
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.720]   make carbohydrates digest slower, et cetera.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.120]   I mean, there's all these adjustments to the glycemic index
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.220]   and so forth with foods in combination.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.840]   Is it better to think about not eating,
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.000]   but your fed state and blood sugar?
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.720]   So for instance, I often get asked on social media,
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.340]   does blank break a fast?
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.200]   So, and so I like to think about it scientifically,
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.880]   like, okay, does plain water break a fast?
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.700]   No.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.540]   Does air break a fast?
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.360]   No.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.100]   Does one grain of sugar of sucrose break a fast?
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.200]   Well, probably not,
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.880]   but does one teaspoon of sugar break a fast?
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.760]   Well, you could say yes, but transiently.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.740]   Like, so, I mean, when we're talking about breaking a fast,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.400]   are we talking about a rise in blood glucose
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.240]   or are there molecular signals downstream
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   of a rise in blood glucose that cannot be reversed?
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.140]   In other words,
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.880]   if I'm going to eat my first meal every day at noon
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:48.040]   and I'm going to eat my last bite of food at 8 p.m.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.580]   and at 9 a.m. for whatever reason,
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.200]   I have coffee with one teaspoon of sugar in it.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.000]   I suppose in the strictest sense, I've broken my fast,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.560]   but maybe by, if I went for a hard run that morning,
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.920]   maybe by 9.30 a.m. I'm back in a quote unquote fasted state.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.000]   So what is the fasted state really?
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.920]   Because when I'm eating at 8 p.m.,
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.800]   just to give another example,
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.920]   I'm start fasting at 801 perhaps,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.960]   but I have my blood glucose is elevated,
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.720]   so I'm not really fasted, I'm fed.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.000]   It's just that I'm not eating the verb, right?
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.440]   Okay, so again, I don't want to get overly detailed
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.680]   just for sake of getting detailed,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.460]   but I think a lot of the confusion out there
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.880]   about what breaks a fast is related specifically
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.440]   to this issue, which is if I eat a whole pizza
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.500]   after sitting around all day,
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.120]   it's very different than if I eat a whole pizza
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.700]   after having run a 26 mile marathon that day.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.840]   Very different, metabolically speaking.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.480]   So how should people think about fasted versus fed?
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.520]   Can we be mildly fasted versus severe fasted?
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.360]   Can we be fed-ish versus very fed?
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.740]   Anyway, I'll stop asking questions now,
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.680]   but 'cause they all relate to the same theme.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.180]   - Yeah, no, these are very interesting question.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.500]   And then unfortunately, as you might have seen in life,
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.740]   the most obvious questions are often unanswered
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.000]   because it's so hard to do these damn experiments.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.880]   Because if you really want to address this in humans,
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.680]   you have to bring humans, put them in isolation.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.080]   Just like you said, I can now imagine planning
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.560]   five or six different experiments.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.680]   Each experiment should involve eight or 10 volunteers,
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.620]   each gender, sex, and then do it.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.520]   So it's difficult.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.480]   So now let's go back to see how do we,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.080]   let's dissect it in terms of say indirect calorimetry.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.840]   So for example, indirect calorimetry is based
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.240]   on this principle that whatever oxygen we breathe in
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.980]   and carbon dioxide we breathe out,
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.320]   if we can measure these two,
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.000]   then we can figure out whether our body in total,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.560]   we are not saying whether it's the liver,
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.660]   gut, or fat, or muscle.
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.040]   In total, whether it's consuming glucose
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.720]   or fat as energy source.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.560]   The idea is when we are without food for several hours,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.200]   then ideally our body will tap onto glycogen first,
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.600]   and then do a little bit of fat.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.440]   And then when the body is mostly running on fat,
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.820]   then that ratio of CO2 to oxygen will come to 0.7.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.820]   But what is interesting is we can do these experiments
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.060]   in mice, so we can go to mice and ask,
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.860]   okay, so what happens in mice?
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.240]   So in mice, mice are a little bit very different
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.420]   because mice are not simply little people.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.500]   They're, the metabolism is different.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:52.500]   They store relatively less glycogen than humans do
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.220]   in terms of total metabolism.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:59.660]   So they overnight within 12 to 14 hours,
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.520]   the RER, respiratory exchange ratio,
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.460]   or this ratio will go from one
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.600]   when they're consuming mostly glucose or carbohydrate
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.840]   as energy source, it will slow down,
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.240]   slowly go to 0.7, 0.75.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.720]   So after 12 to 14 hours,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.040]   they're kind of mostly running on fat.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:24.480]   So now as we give them food, within 10 or 15 minutes,
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.680]   they're not actually consuming couple of grams of food.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.600]   They might have consumed say 100 or 200 milligram
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.220]   of that chow, so which is less than say 5% of their food.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.540]   And then the RER will immediately begin to rise
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.460]   as if that small amount of food
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.680]   stopped that fat burning process
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.860]   and cranked up the carbohydrate burning process.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.340]   - When you say fat burning process,
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.060]   you mean body fat stores being burned, right?
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.580]   Not dietary fat, correct?
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.340]   - Yeah, so it's all body fat.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.200]   That's why I said,
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.160]   we don't know where that fat is being burned
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.540]   because we're just measuring
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.620]   how much mice is breathing in and out.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.260]   So for example, it can be from the skin,
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.520]   so subcutaneous fat or belly fat.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.400]   - But not dietary fat.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.760]   - No, by that time the dietary fat is already absorbed
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.620]   and digested and hopefully it's sitting in the liver
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.980]   or adipose tissue somewhere,
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.240]   but it's the fat that's body fat.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.240]   Yes, thank you for that.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.920]   - Yeah, the reason I ask is that nowadays,
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.560]   I think more than half of the battles about nutrition
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.560]   that I see online relate to this issue
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.080]   where I won't name names,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.000]   but someone will come along and say,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.560]   "A low carbohydrate diet allows you to burn more fat."
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.220]   And the more nuanced people out there will say,
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.060]   "Well, that's true,
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.240]   but you're also talking about dietary fat."
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.440]   You know, the word fat can confuse people.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.900]   I realize you're not doing that.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:47.980]   You are certainly not one of the people
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.820]   guilty of doing this,
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.040]   but indeed you eat more fat, you'll burn more fat,
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.960]   but that doesn't mean you'll burn more body fat.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.960]   In fact, I think the data say
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.240]   that under conditions of caloric restriction,
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.600]   you'll actually burn less.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.880]   I hope I don't, I'll probably get pitchforks
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.420]   sent through the mail toward me on that one,
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.880]   but I think that's true.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.920]   Whereas, you know, people who consume carbohydrate
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.240]   can still burn body fat,
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.380]   even though the majority of the fuel they're burning
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.600]   is from carbohydrates, so.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.620]   - Yeah, so here in this case, for example, for mice,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.680]   we know that as soon as they start eating,
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.560]   the RER goes up.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.760]   Coming back to your question,
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.360]   what would be ideal for us to do?
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.080]   The experiment would be, okay, so we'll go back to that
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.020]   and then give the mouse maybe 100 milligram of food,
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.560]   and mouse runs around in the case,
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.000]   and then we'll continue to measure
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.440]   to see how long it takes for the mouse to come back,
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.400]   and then, so that's one aspect.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.640]   So now let's see, let's stay on this,
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.500]   and then I'll come back and talk about non-caloric food
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.720]   and how, whether that is considered that.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.240]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.160]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.600]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.980]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.880]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.560]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.800]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.380]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.460]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.440]   once or usually twice a day
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.360]   is that it gets to be the probiotics
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.040]   that I need for gut health.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.160]   Our gut is very important.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.700]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.440]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.860]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.500]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health,
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.360]   and those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.180]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.360]   In addition, Athletic Greens
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.660]   contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.540]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.000]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.440]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.840]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.820]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.120]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.720]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.120]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.800]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.180]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.040]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.160]   - So there's a famous experiment
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.220]   that was published last year by Jotakahasi's lab,
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.740]   and it came out in science,
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.520]   and that relates to caloric restriction,
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.680]   and we kind of started with this idea,
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.180]   we started discussing that the rat experiments
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.940]   were done with caloric restriction,
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:28.080]   and researchers reduced calorie consumption
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.320]   by 20% or 30% and gave that food,
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.660]   the rats, and then subsequently mice,
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.600]   and they all lived longer.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:42.100]   What is interesting is, in all those experiments,
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.700]   the researchers came and gave this bolus of food
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.640]   at one time, whereas the ad libitum-fed mice or rats,
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.120]   they had access to food all the time,
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.860]   so they were eating all the time,
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.100]   and then these rats were given 20% less,
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.080]   and what happens is these mice or rats,
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.320]   they're not going to take that less food,
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.420]   which is the restaurant now,
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.400]   and just eat a little bit of lunch
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.080]   and then snack after three hours or snack after three hours.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.960]   They gobble up all that food.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.960]   Within two to three hours, maximum four hours, food is gone.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.940]   - So they're sort of on the OMAD diet, the one meal a day?
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.240]   - Yeah, they're almost like in one meal a day,
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.820]   three to four hours, food is gone,
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.160]   or you can say they're on four hours eating or feeding
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.280]   and 20 hours fasting, so then the question became,
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.260]   well, the benefit of caloric restriction, as we know,
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:41.260]   is it due to reduced calorie or time-restricted feeding,
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.160]   or there is a timing component to it,
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.320]   that they're eating all of that within three to four hours,
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.240]   and then there is a long fasting,
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.680]   and this is a difficult question to answer,
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.240]   because now you have to ask these poor grad students
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.360]   or technicians to come and split that food
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.000]   into eight or 10 or 15 different small portions
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.060]   and then give them to mice in every two hours.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:09.600]   So Joe Takahashi, who actually published the first paper
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.640]   in 2017, showing that most caloric restriction,
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.240]   I mean, he used the protocol that was used
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.540]   by caloric restriction field,
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.980]   it actually creates a condition of time restriction,
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.120]   so he showed that, and then he went back
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.160]   and worked with engineers to come up with a smart case
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:33.720]   where he could actually tell, he could program
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.480]   how much food is given to mice
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.940]   at what time of the day or night, completely programmed.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.440]   So then he took this, for example,
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.760]   suppose the ad libitum fed mice
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.960]   eats five grams of chow in a day,
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.280]   and if you want to reduce calories by 20%,
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.840]   then the CR mouse would get four grams of food,
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.320]   and he divided this into nine or 10 meals,
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.580]   and then gave them in every 90 minutes.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:09.520]   So in this case, they're eating small meals
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.580]   throughout day and night, so there is no fasting,
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.640]   so he can say that, well, this mouse actually
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.400]   is not getting into fasting because in every few hours
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.560]   is getting some food, and then he measured
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.360]   how long the mouse is going to live,
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:29.080]   and he used, this is a very standard protocol,
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.920]   people count how many mice are dying on which day,
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.880]   and then examine them to see whether they died
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.400]   because there was an accident
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.420]   or there was a natural cause,
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.040]   and then they calculate at the end
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.160]   what is the half life,
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.560]   so 50% survival, because that's on an average,
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.120]   that's a good indicator because if there is an outlier
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.420]   that will live for a long time, then that can skew.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:58.160]   So what was interesting was the ad libitum fed mice,
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.800]   of course, they live certain number of days,
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.900]   and then this calorie-restricted mice
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.640]   that never got into super fasting,
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.800]   but kind of eating, snacking throughout day and night,
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.620]   that also live 10% extra, 10% longer,
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.060]   so that means caloric restriction
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.500]   extended lifespan by 10%.
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.700]   - I've wondered about this because recently,
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.900]   you know, there's been,
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.400]   there were a bunch of news headlines
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.860]   about intermittent fasting,
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.620]   and frankly, I was frustrated.
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.060]   If you looked at one major news outlet,
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.500]   they would say time-restricted feeding
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.400]   affords no additional benefit beyond caloric restriction
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.900]   for weight loss.
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:43.900]   Then another popular press venue, let's call it that,
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:49.200]   same study described as time-restricted feeding doesn't work.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.840]   - Yeah. - Right.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.460]   And then another one that may be someplace even more extreme
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.920]   you know, time-restricted feeding only beneficial
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.360]   because of caloric restriction or something like that.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.520]   So what you've essentially got are three different
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.960]   interpretations of the same data,
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.300]   all of which are, well, two of which are true,
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.180]   one of which is false in my opinion.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.560]   But what I think people take away from that is,
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.960]   oh, time-restricted feeding isn't valuable,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.620]   which is not the case.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.020]   I think for many people, it's a convenient way to eat
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.900]   because at least for people like me,
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.460]   it's simpler to designate between portions of my day
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.740]   when I'm eating and portions of my day when I'm not eating,
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.520]   as opposed to portion control.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.780]   For other people, portion control can work.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.080]   But all of that is related to either maintenance
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.260]   or loss of weight.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.620]   None of it deals with the potential health benefits
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.180]   independent of weight loss.
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.740]   - Yeah. - Right.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.680]   And so I think that if we can segment those out,
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.100]   obviously in humans, it's hard to know
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.740]   if a given treatment or experiment is extending life
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.580]   because you don't really know
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.640]   how long people would live anyway, right?
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.060]   Whereas with mice, you have some sense
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.860]   of when the mortality was likely to occur.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.180]   So what can we say about time-restricted feeding
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.040]   and longevity in terms of biomarkers
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.300]   or in terms of any other indication
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.900]   that people who start and stop their feeding window
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.220]   at a consistent time,
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.820]   somewhere between eight and 12 hours per 24-hour cycle,
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.560]   are tilting the scales towards living longer
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.420]   as opposed to living shorter?
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.080]   - This example of this news article that you mentioned
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.060]   is really interesting
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.620]   because that relates to Joe Takahashi's study
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.220]   because I described that if you split calories
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.900]   and eat throughout the day, throughout day and night,
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.620]   then the mice lived 10% extra.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.340]   But if you now give mouse the same calorie-restricted diet
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.000]   and feed them during daytime,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.820]   whether within 12 hours or two hours,
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.220]   then the mice lived 10% extra.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.340]   - Beyond that. - Yeah.
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.140]   - So 20% longer. - 20%.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.860]   - So, okay, so let me make sure I understand
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:57.700]   so that I make sure I understand.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.440]   If you take a certain number of calories
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.040]   and you distribute them throughout the 24-hour cycle,
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:07.020]   it's caloric restriction, the mice will live 10% longer.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:11.040]   If you, however, restrict that to the active cycle,
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.220]   so for humans, the daytime,
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:18.060]   then they live 20% longer. - 20% longer.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.420]   - So it's not just total caloric intake,
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.660]   meaning it's not just important to be sub-maintenance
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.900]   in calories for sake of longevity.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.860]   It also is important as to when in the 24-hour cycle
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.740]   you eat those calories.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:31.800]   Do I have that right?
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.020]   - So now, that's still, the story is not over
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.980]   because these mice were fed during daytime
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.240]   and they're not supposed to eat.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.080]   - That's right.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:40.900]   So for us, it would be the equivalent
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.740]   of being on the night shift
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.220]   and only eating at night, but a sub-caloric,
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.160]   sub-maintenance calorie diet,
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.720]   I guess is the right way to say it.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.140]   - But when he fed mice during nighttime,
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.540]   when they're supposed to eat,
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.580]   and they're getting the same number of calories
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.420]   within 12 hours or two hours,
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:01.740]   then the mice lived 35% longer than the control.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:02.820]   - 35% longer.
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.340]   So scale to human lifespan, which we don't know,
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.820]   but 35% longer would mean that,
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.220]   and again, no one knows, but humans now,
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.720]   what is the average mortality in the United States?
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.180]   Somewhere around 80?
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.020]   - Yeah, so it's around 80.
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:20.180]   It used to be 80, now it's reduced a little bit
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.420]   because of COVID, but let's take 80.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.940]   - Okay, so people are then now living somewhere
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.980]   between 25 and 35 years longer.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:27.820]   - Yes.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.640]   - I'm putting some error bars on there.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.480]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.320]   - Amazing.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.640]   - So that was really profound,
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.580]   but now you pointed out biomarker and other stuff.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:40.260]   So now, if you look at any given time
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.920]   within that experiment, and actually Joe went back
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.300]   and had a separate cohort of mice, very similar,
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.560]   and so that he could take tissue samples,
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.140]   and of course, in this case,
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:55.260]   you have to sacrifice the mouse, and he looked for,
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:43:00.260]   he did a lot of molecular analysis with known markers.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.580]   For example, hemoglobin A1c, covalent or glucose control,
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.980]   cholesterol, all this stuff.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:10.260]   He could not find anything that predicted
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.420]   the benefit of caloric restriction.
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.220]   So that means in this experiment,
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.660]   whatever we know so far, the predictor of longevity,
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:23.260]   none of them could predict whether this CR-only mouse,
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:27.660]   which ate throughout day and night,
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:31.660]   that mouse is going to live less than the night fed mouse
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:34.580]   that was going to live 25% extra.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.340]   - Does that mean that there are biomarkers
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.740]   related to longevity that we just haven't discovered yet?
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.900]   - Yeah, so that's exactly.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:44.420]   So that means whatever we know so far about biomarkers,
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.080]   those he could not use to predict.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.420]   Maybe there was a lot of noise.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.340]   Maybe he wanted, he had to use more number of mice
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:57.320]   to get that because biomarkers are not going to predict
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.700]   in every instance that there is some error.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.400]   What is also very interesting is if you look at the body weight
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.600]   and body composition of all these mice,
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.120]   there is no difference in body weight and body composition.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:10.960]   - Across all these different groups?
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.640]   - Across all these groups.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.680]   - So it doesn't matter when they ate,
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.740]   provided they were sub maintenance calorie intake.
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:22.340]   So fewer calories than is required to maintain their weight.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.540]   It didn't matter what pattern of eating,
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.580]   they were the same weight.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.000]   So that in many ways seems to mimic the human studies
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.420]   where they say, look, it doesn't really matter
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.260]   whether or not you use caloric restriction
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.000]   or you start your feeding window in the morning
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.480]   or start your feeding window in the evening
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   or you portion control for sake of weight loss.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.520]   - Because we're taking a snapshot of that.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.340]   And then another thing with the human study
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.320]   that we are referring to here,
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:52.440]   in that human study, people are actually already eating
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.220]   within 10 hours window habitually
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.100]   when they selected these people
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.460]   to have them enroll in the study.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:03.000]   So they were already eating for 10 hours
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.120]   and fasting for 14 hours.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.860]   All participants had to reduce their calorie intake
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.440]   and they reduced by almost 25%.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.300]   The CR group continued with 10 hours eating window
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.000]   and the CR plus time restricted group
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.480]   had to eat the same number of calories within eight hours.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.120]   - So it's just a two hour difference.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.440]   - It's just a two hours difference.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.320]   - Okay, so that people,
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.640]   I just want to make sure people can understand.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.420]   So in this human study,
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.840]   which is the one that I felt that the popular press venues,
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.760]   all except one venue,
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.160]   got either semi-wrong or badly wrong
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.080]   in terms of their conclusion.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.040]   That was my interpretation anyway,
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.340]   was that either people came into the study
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.600]   eating basically in a 10 hour feeding window,
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.880]   which goes back to my first question,
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.060]   which is that most people are not eating
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.280]   in the middle of the night,
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.060]   where if they're on shift work and they are,
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.460]   then they're sleeping during the day anyway.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.940]   So they're eating in a 10 to 12 hour feeding window anyway.
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.220]   So you're saying they either did caloric restriction,
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.500]   portion control within the 10 hour window
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.200]   or another group within the study,
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.040]   ate sub maintenance calories.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.480]   So caloric restriction, CR as we're calling it,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.760]   the acronym CR,
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.060]   but restricted that to an eight hour feeding window.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.440]   And they didn't see any difference in terms of weight loss.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.280]   - Yeah.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.700]   - But it's not all that surprising, right?
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.500]   I mean, if it's just a two hour difference.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.340]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.480]   So we have done that experiment in mice
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.840]   and we don't see a difference in not only weight loss,
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.600]   many other markers.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.860]   And I was telling you about this Jotaka Haziz paper,
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:31.000]   where I told you that he allowed his mice
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   to eat within two hours or 12 hours, subcaloric diet.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.440]   - Two or 12.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.320]   - Two or 12.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.680]   - Yeah, that's dramatic.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.560]   But still he did not see change in longevity
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.680]   even within those two.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.980]   So that means when you do caloric restriction
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.960]   and then at least for mouse
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.000]   and you are within 12 hours window,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.300]   that is giving the mice the best benefit,
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.940]   the optimum benefit.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:03.940]   And two, three or five or 12 for a mouse doesn't matter,
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.420]   at least for longevity.
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:06.920]   - Can we conclude for humans
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.220]   that whether or not a feeding window is four hours,
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.200]   six hours, eight hours or 12 doesn't matter
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.980]   provided the calories are similar or same?
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.780]   - Well, I won't go to that extent
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.140]   because we don't know many of these,
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:25.080]   particularly we don't know how this eating window
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.140]   will affect both sexes
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.740]   because we always think many of these mouse experiments
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.840]   even that I told you about those are done only in male mice.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.980]   - But that should be changing, right?
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.720]   Because the NIH, I know this
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:37.900]   'cause I'm on study section,
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.260]   which is just a bunch of people who review grants
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.540]   is that every grant now has to include
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.660]   sex as a biological variable.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.740]   It's hard to get away with,
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.980]   or rather I should say it the way it should be stated,
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.200]   which is people are required
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.980]   and should want to look at these phenomenon
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.220]   in male and female mice,
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.240]   especially if there are differences.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.660]   - So in this case, there are many,
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.980]   there was also another paper in time-restricted feeding
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:11.960]   that also came out a big paper showing that the thermogenesis
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.460]   was accounting for loss in fat mass
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.220]   in time-restricted fed mice
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.520]   that was also done only in male mice.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:22.220]   So this is, we are paying attention to it.
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.780]   So we are now doing all of our studies in male and female,
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.440]   and we do see big differences between male and female.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.820]   Coming back to humans,
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.340]   what typically happens is
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.100]   when you're trying to do four hours
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.420]   or six hours of time-restricted eating,
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:39.580]   people will inadvertently reduce their calorie intake.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.900]   - Yeah, just because of gut volume.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.660]   I tried one meal per day,
[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:46.720]   and I felt like I was eating so much at that one sitting
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.740]   that it led to a lot of gastric distress
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.100]   and I got tired after the meal.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.780]   And part of the reason I like to do time-restricted feeding
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.640]   is I have more energy.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:58.020]   And certainly in the fasted state, I feel more energized,
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.000]   especially if I'm ingesting a little caffeine
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.260]   or something like that.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.540]   So people will reduce energy intake,
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:08.220]   and then some people who are more active,
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.540]   they can actually unconsciously,
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:15.180]   they may be spending more energy in their physical activity
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:16.340]   and basal metabolic rate,
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.260]   all of this combined than how much they're eating.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.380]   And that can have a very adverse effect in long-term
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:25.380]   because we know that this energy deficit,
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.800]   and in fact, there is a scientific term for that.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   It's called REDD-S, relative energy deficit in sports.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.220]   - Relative energy deficit in sports, okay.
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.000]   - Yeah, it's because nearly 40% of athletes,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.040]   not the NFL guys, but you know,
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.440]   there are a lot of people who do track and field,
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:51.500]   and nearly 40% of athletes actually experience this REDD-S
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.800]   without knowing.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.320]   - Can male and female athletes both experience REDD-S?
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.780]   So it's REDD-S, R-E-D-S, relative energy.
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:02.200]   - Relative energy deficit in sports.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.240]   Interesting, it's the first I've heard this acronym.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.800]   We have a new acronym, folks.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:09.060]   This is good to add to a list of other acronyms,
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:12.000]   but so males and females can experience it.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   So in females, I've heard that REDD-S can lead to amenorrhea,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.100]   so loss of the menstrual cycle.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.380]   - Yeah, so that's so common that, so prevalent
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.660]   that in fact, many women, many female athletes,
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.960]   they take it for granted that yes,
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:31.940]   if they are more active,
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.680]   then they will lose their menstrual cycle,
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.620]   which may be common,
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:39.360]   but it's not normal or optimum for health.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.180]   - Even if they don't want to get pregnant.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.020]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:43.840]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.780]   We had an expert on female hormones come on
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.160]   and say the very same thing,
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.980]   that regular cycling is a-
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:49.940]   - Is very important.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.900]   - Of ovulatory menstrual cycle
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:55.020]   is important to try and maintain.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.620]   - Yeah, so that's one.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.940]   But then what is really concerning is
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:03.080]   it does affect bone health.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.180]   And in this state, people actually,
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.800]   over a long period of time, they lose bone mass
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.960]   and their bone also becomes more prone to injury,
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.180]   microfracture and fractures.
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.340]   So again, it's a risk.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:21.180]   I mean, some people are trying to eat within very short time
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.540]   and they're physically active, that happens.
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:25.580]   And it also has impact on,
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:30.180]   means the reason why these women are losing menstrual cycle
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:35.180]   is their HPG axis is disrupted,
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.380]   hypothalamus, pituitary, gonadal axis.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.740]   And it starts, it may start even upstream
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.300]   at hypothalamus or pituitary.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.540]   So that means that HPA axis,
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:49.300]   hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal axis
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.980]   may also get disrupted.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.980]   One of the symptoms of reds is also depression,
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:56.420]   anxiety, bipolar-like symptoms.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:01.180]   And we know that many, many athletes experience that.
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:03.820]   We think that, well, this may be just peer pressure
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.260]   that always trying to compete.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:08.220]   And we know that unfortunately there are a few athletes
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:09.380]   who just can't cope it.
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.520]   And there are many attempted suicide or suicide.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.980]   So this is a serious issue.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.660]   And there's also another new topic in the lab
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:23.360]   to come up with a mouse model of reds and then study it.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.520]   But this is one risk why we should not reduce
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:31.520]   our eating interval to one meal or very short time,
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.460]   because it can have adverse side effect
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.780]   that we don't know now.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.740]   Maybe in future we'll figure out
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.180]   when we systematically study them.
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:44.000]   There are studies that are published showing four hours
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.940]   and six hours time restricted eating
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.220]   has benefits on weight loss,
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.500]   but those are on healthy individuals
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.060]   and they were in the studies.
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:57.060]   So the study team were already monitoring,
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:00.220]   they made sure that there was no certain weight loss
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:05.180]   or weight loss below some safety level.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.580]   So those are very different from regular people
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:10.460]   who are who maybe even normal weight,
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.640]   even within the healthy range.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.920]   If they do, then they can potentially.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.160]   So that's why what we think is eight to 10 hours
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.240]   may be the ideal spot to begin with.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:26.120]   And once you are physically active
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.440]   and you are also spending a lot of energy
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.760]   in physical activity or sports,
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.240]   you can even go up to 12 hours
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.480]   because in mice we have done that experiment.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.120]   Up to 12 hours, they do get a lot of benefits, not all, but.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.620]   - So this is 12 hours of feeding?
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:42.720]   - 12 hours of feeding, 12 hours of fasting.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:48.960]   In humans, again, nobody has done systematically 12 hours,
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.720]   but there was one study in Europe
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.560]   from Tin Hai Colette Lab,
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.640]   and Tin Hai and I, we collaborate.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.960]   So they used our micecadian clock app.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.000]   This is a research app we developed just to,
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.340]   this is mostly used in time-restricted eating studies.
[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:08.560]   And he had nearly,
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.360]   I think he started with 200 Swiss participants,
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.100]   but then at the end he selected
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:15.100]   and took very small number of groups,
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.840]   people who are very meticulous
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.560]   about recording all their food
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.960]   and divided them into usual feeding,
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.140]   whatever they wanted to eat, whenever they wanted to eat.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.200]   And they were given the advice of Swiss,
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.480]   nutrition advice that's given to improve health
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.760]   and reduce blood glucose,
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.440]   almost like diabetes prevention program in the US.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.320]   And then the other group was given advice
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.040]   to eat within 12 hours.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.880]   This was very early on in time-restricted eating.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.920]   And we thought that the mice were getting some benefit,
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.340]   let's try whether 12 hours has any benefit.
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:55.440]   The bottom line is at the end of three months and six months,
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.220]   what he reported is both groups
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.640]   lost same amount of body weight.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.640]   And then there was not too much significant difference
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.720]   between groups,
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.200]   but both groups actually improved their health.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:12.360]   So the bottom line is the Swiss nutritional advice
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.240]   that he was giving, which is the standard of care there,
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.300]   it achieved the same amount of weight loss
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:22.960]   as just giving people this advice that eat within 12 hours.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:27.080]   So one way to look at the result is like this.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:30.860]   And then he went to more extent
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.400]   and actually looked at every single meal
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.080]   these people consumed.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.240]   So there are close to,
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:41.000]   I think close to 60 or 70,000 meal records
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.320]   and pictures he went through
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.060]   and then classified them to say
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:47.120]   whether these are good quality food.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.280]   So they call it the NOVA classification.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.320]   One, two, three, four.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:53.840]   One is the food that you can almost eat raw,
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:58.360]   fruits, vegetables, yogurt, dairy products
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:01.180]   that you can almost without any preparation.
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:05.060]   And then second NOVA two is kind of home cooked food
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:07.480]   that most people will prepare in few minutes.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.280]   And then three, and then fourth one
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:13.400]   is the food that you can never prepare at home.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.760]   So for example, biscuit or cookies
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:20.120]   that we usually purchase and few other things.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.280]   And usually the NOVA four are unhealthy ultra processed food
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.580]   so which we should not be eating.
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.880]   So the advice is to reduce NOVA four.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:32.360]   And what he found was people who got all this advice
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.800]   to improve their nutrition quality,
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.760]   they actually improve their nutrition quality.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.220]   They reduce their NOVA four food.
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.880]   And people who are in time-restricted eating
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.760]   they ate within 12 hours.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.600]   They did not change their nutrition quality.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.360]   But what is interesting is they both got the same
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.160]   modest weight loss.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.240]   So that begs the question that in the,
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.880]   maybe Tinhai will do this experiment again
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:57:00.080]   to combine nutrition advice with time restriction
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:03.420]   and maybe reduce the time to 10 hours and that might help.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.120]   So 12 hours is something that I say
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.480]   anyone from five-year-old to a hundred-year-old can do.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.240]   And if you're trying to maintain weight
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.180]   that might be a good way and combine that with exercise.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.520]   It'll be great.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:24.260]   - And people can more easily avoid reds in that way.
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:27.200]   Women and for non-athletes or recreational exercises
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.720]   it sounds like women, if they distribute their calories
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.280]   across 12 hours are less likely
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.500]   to lose their menstrual cycle.
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.200]   - Yeah, so again, this is something
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.580]   that we have to look carefully.
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:40.180]   They have to be, because we do have the My circadian Clock app
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.640]   that many people download and self monitor
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.260]   and they share the data for researchers.
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.000]   - We will provide a link to that, by the way.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.960]   It's a great tool.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.960]   - But once in a while, we do get this input
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.100]   from some women saying,
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.280]   "Oh, I started doing your time ratio eating
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   and I am seeing all these problems."
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.080]   And then I asked them, "Okay, so what else are you doing?"
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.560]   They typically improve their nutrition quality.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.140]   So they're eating only salad and pew.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.960]   And they're trying to increase the fiber intake.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.800]   And it's really hard to eat so much of uncooked food
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:13.120]   because cooking helps to absorb more nutrient.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.120]   And then at the same time,
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.960]   they're running five miles every day.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.840]   And of course, all of this combined
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.800]   can lead to reds-like symptom.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.560]   So that's why 12, I think, is a good point
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.760]   if you're combining physical exercise
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.460]   and better nutrition quality,
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.400]   because in mice also we have seen
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.760]   that if mice are eating healthy food
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.320]   and they're eating within 10 to 12 hours,
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.660]   then they also live longer than mice
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:40.940]   that are eating healthy food,
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:44.280]   but distributing that calorie over a long period of time.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:49.280]   And this is Rafa DiCaba's finding from NIH.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:52.100]   He has systematically done this study
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.220]   with two different types of diet and in mice.
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:56.860]   And he finds the same thing,
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.540]   that even mice that are eating within 12 hours,
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:03.460]   they do live longer than mice that eat randomly,
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:04.960]   even healthy food.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.900]   - I recall a recent study,
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.760]   I think it was either published in Cell Reports
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.960]   or Cell Reports Medicine,
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.260]   forgive me for not remembering which,
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.160]   but both of course, Cell Press journals,
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:14.640]   excellent journals,
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.200]   which explored time-restricted feeding
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.820]   in the context of low carbohydrate
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:21.240]   or non-low carbohydrate diets.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.440]   So it was low carbohydrate
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.800]   versus low carbohydrate and time-restricted.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.880]   So these are all caloric matched between groups.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.420]   And then non-low carbohydrate diets.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:33.020]   So it was sort of more standard,
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:34.100]   I think it was somewhere in the neighborhood
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.780]   of 60% of calories from complex carbohydrates.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:40.980]   And as I recall, the greatest weight loss,
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:44.060]   remember same calories across groups folks,
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:48.040]   was achieved with low carbohydrate plus caloric restriction.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:52.580]   And I wondered why all the popular news venues
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.220]   didn't cover that study,
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:55.380]   but that's why I'm bringing it up now.
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:56.620]   I thought this is really interesting.
[00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:01.620]   And I'm somebody who's cycled low carbohydrate diet before,
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:05.100]   I find it hard to sleep after about three or four days
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.500]   of being on a low starch diet just personally.
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.020]   So I like to eat some starches,
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.540]   especially if exercising intensely or working intensely,
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.360]   that's just a little editorial there that,
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.500]   but look, I know many people who do just feel better
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:19.620]   on a low carbohydrate diet,
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.340]   but what do you think of those data?
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.240]   Because it speaks to the idea that,
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.620]   okay, it's not just the total number of calories,
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.080]   it's not just the quality of those calories,
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.440]   it's the timing of those calories,
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.780]   and maybe carbohydrate restriction in conjunction
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.300]   with time restricted feeding might be the best path
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.460]   for people who are looking to lose weight.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:43.820]   - No, I totally agree that when it comes to nutrition,
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.480]   quality, quantity, and timing, all these three matter.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.140]   Nearly 40% of people who maintain healthy body weight,
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.980]   because 60% are overweight and obese,
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.580]   40% are maintaining healthy body weight.
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:59.960]   And out of those 40%, I would say nearly majority of them
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.820]   are very aware about how much they're eating
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.460]   and what quality of food they're eating.
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.540]   - So you're really an optimist.
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.620]   You're looking at the 40% of the glass that's,
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.620]   or should we say not full?
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.220]   Yeah, that was a pun intended.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:14.600]   But the, no, that's a very interesting way of looking at,
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.940]   rather than saying, why are 60% of Americans obese,
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.580]   saying why are 40% not obese?
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.300]   That's a very interesting way to look at it.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.060]   - Yeah, I mean, subconsciously,
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:27.460]   we're always making the decision.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:30.140]   Means I know, means I'm sure that you are not going
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.420]   and eating cheeseburger every day
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.460]   because you want to improve.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.920]   - Yeah, no, yeah, exactly.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.020]   I wouldn't feel good.
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.980]   Yeah, I enjoy cheeseburger now and again,
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:41.700]   but I, no, not, certainly not at this stage
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.920]   or any stage of my life.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.300]   I think that, I think people,
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.840]   actually you think the pandemic had a lot to do with this.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.060]   I think that people started to take a look
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:55.100]   at what they were doing to support
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.020]   or not support their health generally.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.980]   I know people gained a lot of weight during the pandemic.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.460]   Other people got really into fitness.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:01.380]   I've seen some colleagues,
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.620]   you've always maintained,
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.060]   you've always been in good shape.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.580]   Actually, this is the first time I've seen you in a while
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.880]   and you've seemed to have aged backwards.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:12.880]   So you are a poster for your own ideas and hypotheses
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.420]   about time-restricted feeding.
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.480]   But I noticed that during the pandemic,
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.340]   a number of people emerged from the pandemic in better shape,
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.580]   other people in much worse shape.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:24.580]   It seemed like it was like a bimodal distribution there.
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:30.960]   So yeah, I get the sense that starting and stopping eating
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.580]   at more or less the same time each day,
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.980]   even if caloric restriction is not the main focus,
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.660]   has additional benefits.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.920]   Can we talk about some of those benefits
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.800]   as they relate to the other things that impact health?
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.700]   So for instance, if you're starting and stopping eating
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.380]   at more or less the same times each day,
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.800]   are you sleeping better?
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.420]   Are you getting more predictable shifts
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.580]   in alertness and sleepiness?
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.540]   Like, can you predict when you'll feel good enough
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.880]   to exercise?
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.220]   Maybe we could talk about that because you, of course,
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.260]   are well-known for time-restricted feeding
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.140]   and the science around that,
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.020]   but also other things as well,
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:10.460]   not the least of which is circadian biology generally.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:13.680]   So I always think of the main timekeepers for our system
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.680]   being feeding, light, activity, and social connection.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.740]   Did I miss, maybe, and temperature.
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:22.760]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.040]   So how do these combine with one another?
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.720]   Using timing that we begin and stop feeding
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.640]   is kind of an anchor point.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.780]   Can we explore that a little bit?
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:34.320]   - Yeah, so we got into this beginning and end,
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.960]   and then you asked for the calorie,
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.280]   how much calorie will break the fast.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.840]   One thing that I want the listeners and viewers
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.840]   to bring back to this timing of when we are breaking the fast
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.780]   because we equate health with weight, body weight.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:58.780]   And that's why we are talking about nutrition quality
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:02.620]   and quantity because both of them have impact.
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:05.100]   So now let's think about mental health
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:08.300]   because a lot of people do struggle with mental health.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.980]   They have anxiety or depression,
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.220]   and also gut health because there are a lot of people
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.800]   who also have acid reflux or heartburn.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.120]   And we know that acid reflux or heartburn
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   can be exacerbated by caffeine intake in empty stomach.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.320]   Those who have acid reflux or heartburn,
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.240]   they're prone to that.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.160]   Then having black coffee in the morning
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.660]   before any food can upset their stomach.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.800]   So that's why in those cases,
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.600]   it's very clearly that caffeine for them
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.720]   becomes the trigger that something,
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.360]   the food is supposed to come
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.300]   and then the stomach is not seeing the food.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:54.320]   So it's overreacting, producing excess acid
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.200]   and that comes up to the esophagus
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.840]   and that's what they're experiencing.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.960]   So if people have that kind of condition,
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.620]   then maybe they should consider
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:05.060]   when they drink their first coffee
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:08.700]   is breaking their overall fast
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:13.160]   or kind of putting their health at risk for acid reflux.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.460]   The other thing is people who have anxiety,
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:21.260]   panic attack, we know that caffeine can judge you off.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.700]   - Especially on an empty stomach.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.020]   - Especially on an empty stomach.
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:28.260]   So for them, again, caffeine can be a trigger.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:31.740]   So that's why I want to kind of differentiate
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.160]   that there is this mental health
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.000]   and other aspects of health.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.580]   And these are two clear examples
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:41.320]   where anxiety, panic attack related to brain health
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.300]   or acid reflux related to our gut health.
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:49.620]   In those cases, when we consume that caffeine
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:53.280]   in the morning can affect, so.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.600]   - Do you avoid caffeine in the morning?
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.960]   - No, actually here is the interesting history
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.680]   about caffeine and this is something I did not know.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:06.680]   And I was once invited to this history of nighttime activity
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:10.600]   and maybe we can take a little bit of detour
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.980]   and talk about nighttime activity
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:15.900]   because that fascinates me as a circadian biologist.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:20.860]   'Cause over the last 200,000 years means we assume
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.940]   that humans, Homo sapiens evolved 200,000 years ago.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.420]   So we have been, as a species,
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:29.740]   we have been living on this planet for 200,000 years.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:34.520]   And only in the last, you can say couple of thousand
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:38.460]   or 5,000 years when we came to control fire
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.660]   or maybe you can even go back to 100,000 years,
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:41.720]   there is some debate.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:48.040]   So then the question is, well, when you control fire
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.260]   and we light it up the fire
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.060]   and we could light up whenever we wanted,
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.860]   we can add fuel and we can stop the fire
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.500]   when we don't want it.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:04.300]   That's the key ability in humans that differentiates them
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.900]   from all the other species.
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.180]   No other species.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:12.020]   We can always say, yes, there are signs
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:15.020]   of this intelligent decision-making.
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.300]   For example, we know many crows can make decision.
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.380]   Many, many animals, they kind of figure out,
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:23.300]   strategize how to get food.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.900]   But controlled use of fire
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.620]   is something very specific to human.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:33.120]   And when we started controlling fire,
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.580]   fire did not essentially extend the day
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.960]   because fire created a evening that was very different
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.300]   from what people did during the day
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.860]   and what people used to do during the day.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:50.140]   They worked a lot, means gathering food
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.060]   was almost everything that we did.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:58.060]   And so in the evening after we brought food,
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.000]   mostly tubers or maybe lentils to cook
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.380]   or once in a while animals so that we could barbecue,
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.360]   all of these things happened around fire.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.660]   And fire was so expensive that it was mostly communal fire.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:16.420]   So if you go back to, for example, Maasai
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:21.420]   and all these populations that have no access to electricity
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:26.800]   and they're still living kind of that historical life,
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.340]   fire is a communal event.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.340]   And they sat around, they cooked food.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.300]   And then what happened?
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.720]   They did not talk about work.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.280]   They talked about culture.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.280]   They talked, they sang, they danced, they strategize.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.980]   That's how politics started, philosophy started,
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:47.380]   science started, all of these things
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.180]   that are very unique to human civilization
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.660]   started around fireside chat.
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:55.740]   So in that way, if we think about it,
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.260]   we are still doing fireside chat.
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:58.900]   The only thing is we have the microwave
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:01.900]   and the television or social media.
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:03.860]   - And now we chat with our thumbs, right?
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:07.520]   - So it's still, so we are hooked to that evening activity
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.460]   because that's when we are completely free
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:14.720]   from the pressure of the work and we want to express ourself.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.380]   That's our independent time.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:20.020]   So that's why most people find it very difficult
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.600]   to do timeless eating and stop eating at six o'clock
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:27.260]   because it's ingrained in our even DNA
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:30.580]   that we want to eat and socialize in the evening.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:34.220]   So now let's fast forward and see
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.160]   what is the role of coffee in this?
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:42.740]   If you look at coffee consumption, particularly cafe,
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:45.720]   where people can come and have a little bit of coffee
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.820]   and socialize, it also started as an evening activity.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:54.820]   And this is in, now we can go back to Istanbul
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:59.100]   because that's one place where coffee cafes started
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.520]   in mid 16th century.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.800]   So we are talking about 1540 to 1570.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:10.580]   And that's when, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting the name
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:15.040]   of historians who actually invited me and okay.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:20.040]   His name is Cemal Kefadar and I must be butchering the name,
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.220]   but I'll try-
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.380]   - That's right, he will provide the spelling
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.460]   and the wonderful thing about social media
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:25.920]   is somebody will tell us on YouTube
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.160]   the proper pronunciation.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.600]   So this is a great opportunity.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.700]   If you know the proper pronunciation,
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:33.120]   please put it in the comments on YouTube.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.780]   - Actually, I'm even checking right now
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.520]   in my EndNote library, it's not picking up that.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.900]   - That's right, we'll provide a link.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:43.500]   - So what happened was, so coffee was introduced
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:48.500]   and people came and drank coffee and talked about politics.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.740]   - At night.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:51.020]   - At night, at evening.
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:54.700]   And it actually started with Sufi branch of Islam
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:58.320]   because they are the ones who consumed coffee
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.120]   in the evening and this is the branch of Islam
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.600]   where they actually sing and dance
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.000]   and all that happened in the evening.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.200]   So singing, dancing by the Sufi
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.240]   and then here in Istanbul, people started congregating
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.840]   and having talk about politics.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.180]   But then around the same time,
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:26.760]   some in Turkey, there was a good sizable number
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:30.600]   of Muslims who have to do five prayers a day,
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.480]   number of prayers at set time.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.220]   The first prayer is very early in the morning.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.520]   And then they figured out that if they wake up
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.200]   and immediately have coffee,
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.060]   then they can stay awake for the first prayer.
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.680]   And in that way, they felt pretty good.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.440]   They woke up, so that's how it started as a morning drink
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   to stay awake and kind of get on with the day.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.920]   But what happened was,
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.380]   I don't know whether you have ever tried Turkish coffee.
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.460]   It's very thick.
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:02.600]   - Yeah, a few years ago, right before the pandemic, 2019,
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:06.060]   I traveled to Turkey, first of all, the food is amazing.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.720]   The coffee is indeed very, very thick.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:12.980]   And I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:17.140]   from drinking so much coffee in Yerba Mate over the years
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.980]   and still do, I really enjoy it.
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.500]   But yeah, it's very intense.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:25.840]   And so what you're saying is that coffee intake
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.480]   started as a way to extend into the night.
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.420]   The ability to extend into the night at all
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:32.880]   was because of the ability to harness fire.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.600]   And then coffee's stimulatory properties
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.940]   were leveraged toward morning,
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:41.880]   which is essentially like the way I think about it,
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.280]   we did an episode on caffeine and someone else,
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.260]   Michael Pollan, not I, described it this way,
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.160]   that you're sort of taking a loan out
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.980]   on your energy bank account with coffee.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.580]   You're suppressing the adenosine system,
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.980]   adenosine makes you sleepy,
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.820]   but that adenosine system will kick in later.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:59.580]   So it's a credit card of sorts with an interest, right?
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.620]   And the interest being an energetic lag
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:05.980]   that you're going to experience in the afternoon.
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:09.220]   - But what happened was the strong coffee
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:13.300]   that gave heartburn and acid reflux to a lot of people.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:18.100]   So then they started eating something with coffee
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:21.240]   and that's how the culture of breakfast started in Turkey.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.700]   - Ah, so coffee actually led
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.220]   to the development of breakfast, not the other way around.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.820]   - And that, yeah, so-
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.100]   - That's very heartening, again, no pun intended,
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:35.740]   for the caffeine lovers among us,
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:37.980]   which I count myself one of those.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:41.440]   - So essentially the food before coffee became breakfast.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.380]   So you kind of give something to your stomach
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.140]   so it's busy digesting that.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.180]   And then when the coffee comes in,
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:53.300]   it's not reacting to coffee and creating acid reflux.
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.940]   - So it wasn't as fascinating.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:59.020]   So it wasn't that breakfast is necessary on its own.
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:03.060]   It was essentially a buffer against the gastric distress
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.780]   caused by caffeine intake.
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.580]   - At least in that culture, in that context.
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.500]   We cannot say whether the same thing happened
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.840]   and all over the world where coffee is not consumed,
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.140]   but still people eat something in the morning.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:18.720]   - You said you start your first meal of the day
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.540]   at around eight, what time do you wake up?
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.580]   - I wake up around six, I started at six.
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.620]   - What time do you have your first caffeine?
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:25.780]   - No, actually I have,
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.540]   so that's why I brought up this story
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.820]   because I have coffee after my breakfast.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:32.620]   - Fantastic, I'm a big proponent of delaying caffeine intake
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:35.060]   for a few hours after waking for other reasons
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:37.740]   that my listeners have heard me talk about endlessly.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.060]   So I won't bother with that now.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:43.020]   But I think allowing,
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.240]   just suffice to say that allowing some of the natural
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:48.260]   waking up signals to occur and using light
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:52.500]   to kind of clear away and adenosine to further extend
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.520]   and activity is better than using a stimulant,
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.940]   but until a few hours later.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.020]   This is fascinating because I've never thought
[01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:02.160]   about the link between extension into the night,
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:07.060]   socialization or socializing rather, feeding and caffeine.
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.700]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:11.780]   and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.260]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.800]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.440]   to help you better understand your body
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.260]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:22.920]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.340]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.360]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.940]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:32.020]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.560]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.100]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.860]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.620]   Inside Tracker solves that problem
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:42.940]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.960]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.820]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:49.960]   you might want to take on
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.540]   in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:54.340]   hormones, lipids and other things
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.300]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.580]   to bring those numbers into the ranges
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.980]   that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.500]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.960]   go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.860]   They have a special promotion right now
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:09.980]   through Pi Day, March 14th,
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.900]   where you can get 31% off their ultimate plan.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.760]   This is their biggest promotion of the year.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.740]   Again, if you go to insidetracker.com/huberman,
[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.440]   you can get 31% off their ultimate plan.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.440]   - Now, actually, I'm kind of speaking
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.460]   what many other researchers have found
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:28.860]   and this particularly, this fireside chat,
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:31.620]   I'm forgetting again, the name of the scientist.
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.800]   I think she's from University of Washington, Seattle.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.760]   She went to Africa and kind of recorded
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.940]   what people are talking.
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:42.220]   Of course, she could not understand what they were talking.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.180]   - Twitter and whether or not Tesla's talk is going up.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.940]   Of course, no, no, no, just kidding, folks.
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.660]   - And then came back and tried to translate
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.680]   and then figured out that what they were talking
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.380]   during daytime and in the evening were very different.
[01:16:55.380 --> 01:17:00.420]   - What are they talking about at night?
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.140]   - Exactly, so this is like they're talking about matchmaking
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:08.300]   and talking about politics and strategizing
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:13.300]   to gather food or even singing and dancing.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:17.540]   So this is, if we think about it,
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:22.540]   how we manage sunset to our bedtime,
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:26.520]   what we do between sunset and bedtime
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.740]   affects most of our health.
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:31.840]   - I'm gonna think about that for a moment.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.720]   I totally agree.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.980]   And by the way, I'm a huge believer
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:41.980]   and I'm living in great hope for the idea that right now,
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:45.140]   I do think that scientists understand a lot more
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:46.580]   about the different stages of sleep,
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:48.300]   slow wave sleep, REM sleep, et cetera,
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:50.340]   than we do active waking states.
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.460]   Like we talk about being focused or being alert,
[01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:55.720]   but those aren't scientific terms as we know.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:59.640]   But I do believe, and I've noticed a distinct difference
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.780]   between the first eight hours of the day
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:03.900]   in terms of cognition.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.420]   And we know that the catecholamines
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.940]   are at much higher levels plus cortisol,
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.260]   so dopamine, cortisol, epinephrine,
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:10.860]   all of that is really at much higher levels
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.640]   than in the later evening.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.300]   And so this evening time,
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.660]   it's certainly in the context of mental health,
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.020]   we know that morning and evening,
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:22.460]   we are basically different creatures, yeah, completely.
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.840]   - Yeah, so that's why I think in the evening,
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.540]   if you think about it, again,
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:30.000]   this is again, another set of research
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.340]   from my good friend Horatio who-
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:35.700]   - Horatio Iglesias.
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:38.660]   Oh yeah, I'm a big fan of Horatio.
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:39.740]   He's a fellow Argentine.
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:42.620]   So occasionally we riff about things related to that,
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:44.500]   but he's a wonderful biologist.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.680]   Are you guys collaborating?
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.380]   - Yeah, he's kind of, I say he's very humble
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:50.660]   and keeps a low profile,
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.580]   but he does amazing, amazing research.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:57.020]   And he does research that we want to know,
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.600]   but nobody is ready to do it
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.420]   because field research is very difficult
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:05.260]   to go to the wilderness or go to the places
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:08.300]   where there is no electricity and then record
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:11.980]   when these people are eating, sleeping,
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:15.400]   or in this case activity, exposure to light.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.160]   That's what Horatio has done.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.820]   And he puts this active watch,
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:23.620]   which is kind of a modern activity tracker,
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:26.000]   but it's a little bit more refined
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.620]   because it also collects light information.
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:32.340]   And what he found was most of these Argentinian tovas
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:35.340]   who have no access to electricity,
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:38.180]   they consistently go to bed somewhere
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:40.840]   between three to three and a half hours after sunset.
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:42.700]   So this is very important because we always think
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:46.900]   that our ancestors, when they didn't have electricity,
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:48.980]   as soon as the sun went down, they just went to sleep.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:52.340]   No, the fire extended their evening.
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:56.020]   So they were staying awake for three to four hours,
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:01.020]   kind of decompressing themselves that we say,
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:04.820]   and then doing all these activities, cooking,
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:07.820]   sharing meals, and then they would go to sleep.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.180]   And if you look at the sleep onset variability,
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.640]   it was very small.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.020]   Like they're going to bed almost within 15 to 30 minutes
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.660]   standard deviation.
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:19.420]   - So no night owls versus morning people.
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:20.820]   - Exactly, so we'll get to that.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:25.380]   - No, no, I get attacked for many reasons.
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.020]   It just goes with the business I'm in
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.780]   of being public facing these days.
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:32.060]   But every time I talk about viewing sunrise
[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:34.580]   or low angle sunlight, getting some sunlight early
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.780]   that someone says, well, I'm a night owl.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.760]   And they just, it's almost like a protest
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.520]   of trying to protect identity.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.740]   It's become this ideological identity related thing.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:48.380]   I'm a night owl, I'm a morning person and I'm not.
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.120]   But you're telling me that in these cultures
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.940]   where there isn't electricity, but there is fire,
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:55.340]   people are going to sleep within all of them,
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:58.060]   within about 15 minutes of one another.
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.940]   So there is no such thing as a night owl
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:00.780]   or a morning person in the context of-
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.540]   - Yeah, so Horacio actually asked him pointedly
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:07.140]   because, and then he said, no, he has not seen.
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.460]   Means he has tracked hundreds of people.
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:13.820]   And if we ask, there are many, many sleep researchers
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:18.820]   or at least the public facing sleep physicians or experts,
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.860]   they will say, yeah, we can say one third of people
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:23.700]   are night owl, one third are morning.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.620]   And then one third are in between.
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.260]   - Yeah, they call them like bears, wolves,
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:29.240]   and I'm not being disparaging of that idea.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:33.000]   I think people really do feel as if they orient
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.580]   towards one pattern or another.
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:35.820]   - When I was an undergrad student,
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:38.300]   I never went to bed before midnight.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:41.580]   And actually, midnight was my going to bedtime.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:46.260]   Exactly like 11, 45, I'll try to get ready to hit bed.
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:47.680]   And then by 12, I'm in bed.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.460]   And I used to get up at six, 6, 15.
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:51.540]   - That's a pretty short sleep.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.500]   - With an alarm, of course.
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.860]   But then daytime, I used to take 45 minutes to one hour nap.
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:59.200]   And that was regular.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.180]   Like even if whenever I got time,
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.340]   of course in college, you don't have the whole day.
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:09.340]   Unlike in high school, you don't have opportunity to nap,
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:10.500]   but in college, you can.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.580]   - I might've been one of those kids
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.180]   with his hoodie on napping on the desk,
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.460]   but they come around and they wake you up.
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:17.100]   - Yeah, but in this case, just come back to the dorm
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:20.820]   and after lunch usually, I used to take nap.
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:24.680]   So then in grad school,
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:28.000]   I remember I rarely went to bed before two a.m.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.520]   And I could have clearly said that I'm a night owl
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.420]   and actually I was a night owl.
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:36.500]   I was very comfortable staying off so late.
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.820]   I was very productive doing experiments,
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:42.900]   writing all these manuscripts mostly.
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:49.460]   But then afterwards, when I look back in postdoc,
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:53.000]   when we had our daughter,
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.460]   then things started changing
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:59.340]   because you have to put the baby to sleep.
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:03.180]   And then after the baby sleeps,
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:05.140]   it's almost when you have a baby,
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:07.540]   your life revolves around the baby.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:11.260]   So then we had to dim down the light.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:13.760]   There is no caffeine and alcohol drinking
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.880]   or any other things after the baby sleeps
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.620]   because we cannot do too much noise.
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:22.300]   So then I realized that, no, I'm actually not a night owl.
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:25.100]   And I became kind of more normal
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:29.240]   because I could go to sleep between 10 and 11.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.500]   And that's how I thought,
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.740]   well, maybe this was very unique to me.
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:40.540]   But what is interesting is I have another colleague,
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:43.080]   good friend, Ken Wright Jr.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:43.920]   - At Colorado.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:44.820]   - At Colorado.
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:49.820]   And he also had grad students and postdocs like me
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:53.640]   who strongly believed that they were night owls,
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.680]   just like everybody else.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.780]   And Ken took the whole lab for camping.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:02.400]   And when they were camping, of course, there is less light
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.620]   and a lot of physical activity, hiking during the day.
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:10.620]   And they all went to bed between nine and 10, 30 p.m.
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:11.960]   - I love that study.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.920]   What Sachin just described was a study,
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.160]   I think there were two studies.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.000]   - There were two, yeah.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.120]   - And what's interesting, as I recall,
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.220]   is that after going camping for a weekend
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:24.560]   where people wake more or less with the sunrise
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.340]   and go to sleep a few hours after sunset,
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:31.160]   their melatonin rhythms and cortisol rhythms
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:35.520]   and sleep-wake rhythms persisted on that schedule
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:39.600]   for several weeks, despite returning to environments
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.160]   where there was a lot of artificial lighting,
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:44.000]   which I find amazing, that just a weekend
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.680]   of consistent rising and going to bed
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.920]   with the sunrise and sunset, more or less,
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.840]   allowed a reset that was very long lasting.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.920]   - Yeah.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:58.480]   So actually, even in Horacio's study,
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:01.280]   he found that almost all the Tobas,
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.960]   they wake up around sunrise time.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:06.720]   And it's amazing when I look at the standard deviation,
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.520]   it's like so tight.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.060]   - So take that, night owl, so-called night owls.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:13.760]   - I also, in graduate school, I would work until 2 a.m.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.400]   I loved it, I would blast music in the lab.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.780]   Everyone was at home, pretty much, not everyone,
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.700]   but there were the night crew.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.500]   And then I'd get in sometime around,
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.360]   get up sometime around 9.30, 10,
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.480]   and then get in around 11, and it was no problem
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:29.360]   because I was going to stay so very late.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.840]   And then over time, I noticed I'd become more locked
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:32.680]   to a standard schedule.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.360]   So I think what we're saying is that the clock can,
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.080]   our internal clocks can shift.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:36.920]   - Yeah.
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.360]   - But this idea that we are genetically biased
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.480]   towards one schedule or another may need revisiting.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.240]   That's what, that's the conclusion I'm taking from this.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.000]   - There's a couple of aspects.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.500]   One is, you know, some people are genetically so pre-programmed
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:54.180]   because the other flip side is what is called
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:57.780]   technically familial advanced sleep phase syndrome.
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:02.780]   So these people, you can give them caffeine or whatever,
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:05.980]   but they will fall asleep, say at eight o'clock.
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:08.620]   They cannot stay awake till nine or 10.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:12.180]   And since it's a very strong phenotype
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:14.380]   in sleep and circadian rhythm field,
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.060]   they are very well studied.
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.980]   So in fact, Louis Patasek and Yngwie Fu,
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:22.400]   they were the first one to track one family like this,
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.820]   and then they figured out there was a mutation
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:28.560]   in one of the clock genes, period two, that clock gene,
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:33.560]   and that mutation allowed the clock to run in a way
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.620]   that these people went to bed very early.
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:41.300]   - I guess, historically, given these fireside chats,
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:43.740]   those people were probably not contributing much
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.480]   to the political discussion.
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.460]   Whatever was decided after they went to sleep
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:48.780]   is what they woke up into.
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:50.760]   That reminds me, because as you were describing,
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.580]   the difference between nighttime discussions
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:53.900]   versus morning discussions,
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:56.980]   is there any theme to what is discussed in the morning
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:57.820]   versus in the nighttime,
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:58.980]   or are people just sipping their,
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.820]   eating and sipping their caffeine and just waking up?
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:04.740]   But is there, are there any ideas
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.780]   about what morning discussions really consist of?
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:08.780]   - Morning discussions or daytime discussions
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:11.500]   are mostly about work,
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:16.220]   and like hunting, gathering, farming, all that stuff.
[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:18.420]   And even these days, that's what we do.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:22.180]   We, you know, you go to, I go to work,
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:24.100]   and it's mostly one meeting after another,
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:26.140]   and we're talking about how,
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.900]   means if you're in different committees
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.680]   and you're solving problems,
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.300]   or your students come with questions,
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.080]   you have your TA or the office hours,
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.780]   all these things, work-related.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:40.300]   We're not talking, I mean, serious philosophy,
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.980]   unless you are in a philosophy department
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:44.660]   and you are talking of political science.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.400]   And also we are not singing and dancing.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.820]   So that's why the evening activity,
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:53.380]   even these days, are very different.
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:55.380]   And typically the evening activities
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:58.540]   are where we express ourselves.
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:00.100]   We express who we are.
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:02.220]   We feel like we are free.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:04.740]   And, you know, you and I,
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:07.600]   we have this academic intellectual freedom.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.940]   We can talk about our work just like we're talking now.
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.680]   There are a lot of people who work for,
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.560]   even in tech industry,
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.180]   they may be working for Google
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:18.460]   and all these big tech companies.
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:21.140]   They cannot talk about their work to anybody else.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.060]   - It's all a secret.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:23.400]   - It's all secret.
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.820]   So just imagine they're staying,
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:30.820]   so they're spending more than half of their wake-up time
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.720]   at work, thinking and doing work,
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:37.300]   but they cannot talk about that work,
[01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:40.300]   even sometimes to their own family members.
[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:42.540]   So then what happens for them,
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:44.040]   a lot of people also do the same thing,
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.880]   like the person who is going and baking in a restaurant
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:52.440]   or cooking or the person who is taking truss and driving.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.980]   - Or nurses and doctors can't talk about their patients.
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:56.540]   There's confidentiality.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:57.380]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:59.260]   - And some people just don't want to talk about it.
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.280]   It's so stressful.
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.820]   They don't want to bring that stress home.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:05.280]   So that's why I always say that from sunset
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.880]   until we go to bed,
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:10.220]   during that time, we try to find time for ourselves.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:13.180]   People say, "This is me time."
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:15.660]   The me time is essentially,
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.240]   we want to truly express who we are
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.260]   or we want to entertain ourselves
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:24.360]   because on the fireside chart,
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.980]   it's not that everybody was a performer.
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:28.640]   There are also some audience.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.740]   So we always switch our role.
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.900]   Sometimes we are performing and sometimes we are observing.
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:36.420]   So that's what happens with me time.
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:37.260]   - I love this.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:39.900]   So maybe social media time should be restricted
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:42.220]   to just maybe a small portion of that evening time.
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.900]   'Cause I would hope that people would also interact socially
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:46.700]   within the real sense. - Or maybe in a constructive
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:49.100]   way, or maybe you use that for,
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.120]   connect with your family members whom you love,
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.720]   or you can have some productive discussion or something.
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.620]   So it's kind of interesting.
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.380]   - I think it's extremely interesting
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:00.740]   because I think, again, this conversation
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:02.240]   about time-restricted feeding
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.840]   is really a conversation about-
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:04.740]   - Security and rhythms.
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:08.080]   - And sleep-wake activity and human evolution, right?
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:11.700]   - So that's why, let's go back to this night owl
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:14.760]   because we kind of made a comment
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.240]   that maybe it's not genetic,
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.520]   but this is where I'm still wrapping my head around
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:24.520]   because these days, there are some GWAS studies
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.060]   where they're trying to look at night owls
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:32.060]   to see whether there are some genetic linkings.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.620]   And, you know, sometimes we always think,
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.420]   yeah, if you take half a million people,
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:38.340]   of course you'll find some loci.
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:41.540]   But going back to this idea
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:45.060]   that are some people more sensitive to light
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:48.460]   so that it's likely that the same level of light,
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.740]   even in the same household,
[01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:54.020]   may make some people stay awake late into the night,
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:56.200]   whereas other people are more resistant to light
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.340]   so that they can go to bed early.
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:02.700]   And since light has become so prevalent these days
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:05.060]   and this Toba story that we are talking about
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:06.240]   or people going on camping,
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:08.280]   there is, we have removed that light.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:14.980]   So there is some evidence that people's light sensitivity,
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:17.340]   particularly the IPRGC
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:21.440]   or this intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell,
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.940]   or the simple speakers, the blue light sensors in our eyes,
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:30.040]   there seems to be even one log unit change in sensitivity
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:33.080]   as measured by pupil constriction.
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.760]   - So for some people,
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:38.000]   a small amount of artificial light at night
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.080]   could really shift their circadian clock,
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.320]   wake them up, essentially.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.960]   - And then for some, it may not.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.320]   - Yeah, I'm very sensitive to light at night,
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.000]   exquisitely sensitive to it.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.160]   - Oh, so then you are like a teenager.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.540]   - Yes, in many ways.
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:54.560]   I've been told this, thank you, I think.
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:58.260]   I have actually switched to using a red nightlight,
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:31:59.780]   but I should be clear,
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:02.860]   not a fancy high cost red light
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:05.160]   for sake of any kind of infrared simulation,
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.540]   but a red party light type light.
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:10.180]   And I find that that was based on reading one study
[01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:12.520]   that we covered in an episode on jet lag and shift work,
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:15.020]   which was that it seems to reduce
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:18.820]   the cortisol releasing properties of light at night
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.560]   to use red shifted light.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.540]   So I just use a red light bulb.
[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.460]   I actually travel with one.
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:25.740]   If I go to an Airbnb or a hotel and I switch to red light,
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.840]   and I find that I fall asleep and stay asleep
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.080]   throughout the night much more consistently,
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.020]   especially when I'm in new environments
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:34.600]   where it always makes it disruptive to sleep,
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.880]   it's made an enormous difference
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.420]   in the depth and duration of my sleep.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:43.380]   And because oftentimes hotel lights in the bathroom,
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:45.180]   you'll turn them on and you're just getting beamed.
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:46.640]   And you're right, some people don't seem
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:48.600]   to be bothered by that.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:51.260]   I really struggle with that.
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:55.260]   Yeah, and in fact, in teen age, right after puberty,
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:58.980]   there seems to be, I think that's when the teenagers
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:01.340]   become more sensitive to light.
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:06.680]   And it's well known that the teenage boys and girls,
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:09.220]   they tend to stay awake late into the night
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:12.760]   and they can stay up to 12 past midnight.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:16.100]   Although they can stay up that late,
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:19.140]   that doesn't mean that their sleep schedule is reduced.
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:21.980]   Their body still needs the same amount of sleep
[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:23.040]   as other teenagers.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:26.380]   So that's why they are more likely not to wake up
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:29.900]   at 6.30 or seven when we expect them to wake up
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:30.860]   and go to school.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:35.500]   - I have a question and I ask every circadian
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:38.700]   related biologist that I can come into contact with this.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:40.360]   And no one has been able to give me an answer
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.660]   one way or the other.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:44.200]   But I grew up hearing that every hour of sleep
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:47.340]   before midnight was of more value or potency
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:49.100]   than the hours after midnight.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:53.620]   And indeed, I find that if I go to sleep at 9.30 or 10 p.m.,
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:57.140]   I can wake up at three or 4 a.m. feeling pretty fantastic
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:58.700]   and ready to lean into the day.
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.980]   But if I get the equivalent number of hours of sleep
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:04.700]   starting at midnight, I feel like complete garbage
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:06.780]   when I wake up after five, six hours.
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:11.240]   So is there any truth to the idea that going to sleep
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:15.980]   within three hours of sunset is somehow better
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:18.040]   for our circadian timing mechanisms?
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.220]   - Well, there are a few things.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.460]   One, you said that you are very sensitive to light.
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:26.140]   So I assume that you also avoid bright light in the evening.
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:27.060]   - As best I can, yeah.
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:28.980]   - As best as you could, can.
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:31.780]   And then what is happening is with absence
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:35.260]   of that bright light, your melatonin levels begin to rise.
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:37.380]   So you are prepared for sleep.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:40.200]   Of course, this is something that we cannot measure
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:43.620]   because measuring melatonin in every one hour or 30 minutes
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:48.140]   is very difficult and there is no consumer-facing
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:49.080]   product yet.
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:54.060]   So it's likely that your body is preparing very well
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:56.220]   under this dim light to fall asleep.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.220]   And when you are trying to stay awake
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:02.840]   and go sleep at midnight, then maybe from midnight
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.180]   for the first three or four hours, you are sleeping well.
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:07.540]   But then after that, your melatonin level
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.340]   might be beginning to fall.
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:13.700]   And it's not only melatonin, your core body temperature
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.860]   and then your heart rate and everything is changing
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:17.540]   to make you awake.
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:20.100]   But the sleep debt that you have accumulated
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.580]   is pushing you to be in bed.
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:26.300]   So there is this tension between the circadian aspect
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:27.700]   and your sleep debt.
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:32.100]   And unfortunately, you cannot have good night
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:35.380]   of restorative sleep for the second half of the sleep
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:36.700]   because of the tension.
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:37.700]   - That makes good sense.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:40.940]   - Yeah, so that's why you are not the only one.
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:44.620]   There are many people who experience that.
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:46.900]   And in fact, a lot of people think that,
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:49.320]   well, this may be the way I sleep.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:54.260]   Maybe I'm not designed to sleep restoratively
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:58.600]   until I sleep one day, just like the camping trip.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:01.680]   - And then they realize what it feels like
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.340]   to be empathetic. - What you're missing, yeah.
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:04.740]   - Absolutely.
[01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:07.680]   I want to make sure that we talk about the other aspect
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:11.400]   of fire, which is you had a paper that came out recently,
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.040]   very interesting paper, studying firefighters
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.620]   and time-restricted feeding in firefighters.
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:17.600]   Would you share with us the general contour
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.800]   and maybe even some of the specifics of that study?
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.520]   'Cause I think it's very interesting
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.120]   for sake of shift workers,
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:26.760]   but for everybody really to understand these results.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:28.460]   - Yeah, so let's go back to shift workers
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:31.040]   because this also relates to all of us
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.640]   because I always say that each of us is a shift worker
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:38.080]   or has lived the life of a shift worker.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:43.000]   And we have experienced how terrible, difficult it is.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.420]   And now let's start with what is the definition
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:50.560]   of a shift worker or shift work lifestyle?
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.320]   There is no universal definition, unfortunately,
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.320]   but there are many European countries.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.780]   And particularly if you go
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:59.000]   to international labor organization,
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.520]   then you'll find some references.
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:04.080]   Different European countries
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.000]   have slightly different definition,
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.640]   which essentially points to if you stay awake
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:13.720]   for two or more hours during your habitual sleep time.
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:15.740]   And when they say habitual sleep time,
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:19.720]   they assume that we are, just like you said,
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.000]   we are kind of programmed to sleep somewhere between,
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.860]   say 10 p.m. and then stay in bed
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:28.920]   and kind of wake up after 5 a.m.
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.520]   So the idea is if you're staying awake
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:36.360]   for two or more hours between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.,
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:38.880]   and you are engaged in some activity,
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:42.200]   whether it's physical activity or intellectual activity,
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:45.920]   you are not lying in bed and wondering,
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.240]   worrying about something, but actually working.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.040]   So that defines, that's defined as shift work.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.100]   And you don't have to do it every single day.
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:58.100]   Even if you do it once a week for 50 weeks,
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.160]   then that itself is enough to disrupt your physiology
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.040]   and metabolism, behavior, brain function,
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:06.880]   like a shift worker.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.920]   The reason is, as you discussed,
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:14.340]   when you change our external timing cue,
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:16.760]   so in this case, when you travel jet lag
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.840]   or traveling across three days,
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.840]   three hours of jet lag will take three days to reset.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:29.180]   Similarly, if you're staying awake for two hours extra,
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:30.800]   or if you're waking up two hours
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:33.660]   before your habitual wake up time,
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:36.640]   then we just don't get wake up
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:39.580]   and then be engaged in some activity in the dark.
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:43.880]   Most of us, unless you are wearing infrared goggles,
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:47.380]   we turn on light and light resets our clock.
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:52.380]   So in that way, every time we stay up
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.360]   for two or more hours, even for one night,
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:56.720]   then for the next two nights,
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:59.260]   our clock is kind of trying to catch up.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.300]   So in that way, for three days,
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:03.680]   the day of the disruption
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.840]   and then two days following the disruption,
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.960]   our clock is trying to catch up with the outside time.
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.000]   So our clock, our body is not on time with our clock.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.760]   So that means almost for half of the week
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.720]   or half of the year, our clock is trying to catch up.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.360]   So that's the definition of shift work.
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:28.360]   So now let's come back to Department of Level Statistics,
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:33.360]   US government, they have not been tracking
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.700]   what percentage of people are doing shift work accurately
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:39.960]   because there are many difficulties in tracking too.
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:44.280]   But it's generally accepted that one in five working adults
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:46.520]   is a card carrying shift worker.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.020]   Card carrying shift workers means they are nurses,
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:56.040]   doctors, firefighters, and bakers,
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:02.120]   truck drivers, and many in the service industry.
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.320]   So that's one in five.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.780]   So 20% of working adults.
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:11.240]   Then if we think about all the college students,
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:14.400]   just like I was doing and you must have done,
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.600]   there are also- - Grants, deadlines.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.220]   Grants, deadlines. - Grants, deadlines.
[01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:22.840]   Then we are also experiencing the lifestyle
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:26.280]   of a shift worker because we're delaying sleep.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.000]   Even if you're delaying sleep by two hours
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.080]   for most of the college students for five days
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.220]   and then the weekend you're trying to catch up,
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:34.980]   that's kind of a circadian disruption going on.
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:39.880]   Then you take 1.5 or 1.6 million new moms
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.440]   in the US every year.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.260]   So when the child is born,
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:46.320]   then that mother is a shift worker.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.640]   And actually that mother is worse than a shift worker
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.840]   because you don't know what time of the night
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.900]   the baby will wake up and how many times,
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:00.640]   and there is no weekend in motherhood.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:03.820]   So they're also living the life of a shift worker.
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:10.440]   We don't count many food delivery and Uber driver,
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.500]   Lyft drivers as shift workers,
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:14.760]   but many of them we know that they live.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:18.880]   So in that way, we think the actual number of people
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.120]   who are experiencing the life of a shift worker
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.400]   is somewhere around 50% of the adults,
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.040]   population at any given time.
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:30.260]   So that's why it's also another point
[01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.840]   that you might have heard from people.
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.080]   They will say, "Oh, I cannot do time-restricted eating
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.240]   because my schedule is messed up
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:39.520]   or I work in a different way."
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:42.380]   And that comes into play.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:45.460]   So that's why we thought,
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:48.200]   "Okay, so we should try something on shift worker."
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.440]   Another point is although one in five people
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:53.120]   are shift workers,
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:57.640]   they carry disproportionately heavier burden of disease
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:01.360]   because almost all age-related disease that we can think of,
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:02.880]   whether it's high blood pressure,
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.360]   usually high blood pressure starts in 40s or 50s,
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:11.360]   high cholesterol, gastrointestinal problem, indigestion,
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:15.520]   chronic inflammation of the colon,
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:18.780]   and then even colon cancer in many cases.
[01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:21.560]   And then of course, diabetes,
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:26.040]   all of these are disproportionately more prevalent
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.420]   among shift workers.
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:31.680]   But then when you think about clinical trials,
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:35.320]   whether it's a drug or a lifestyle,
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:39.800]   often one of the top 10 exclusion factor criteria
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:41.140]   is shift work.
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:43.220]   So people who are doing shift work,
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:46.900]   we exclude them from many of these trials.
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.860]   One thing is most physicians and most scientists,
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:52.300]   even people who do shift work,
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:57.060]   they know that their body and mind is so messed up
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:01.080]   that oftentimes even medications may not help them.
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.920]   And so that's why if we don't try new medication,
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:07.360]   why to take the risk when we know it may not help them.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.420]   And then when it comes to lifestyle intervention,
[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:11.920]   whether it's sleep extension, for example,
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:14.280]   we cannot do because they are supposed to stay awake
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.140]   and do their job.
[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:17.760]   We cannot ask them to stay asleep at night.
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:21.720]   And then physical activity and exercise,
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.520]   some people can do,
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:27.360]   but some people are so tired after all night
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.080]   that they don't have the energy to do physical activity.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.360]   And then nutrition, again,
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:36.680]   most nutrition studies involve the participants
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:41.680]   to come to the clinic and get one-on-one
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:47.000]   or attend group sessions, and they cannot come.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.560]   And they cannot even sometimes come to the clinic visit
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.000]   when people have to draw blood.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000]   And in fact, there is another caveat that just,
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.900]   suppose I'm healthy,
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:06.040]   I have perfectly normal blood pressure, blood glucose,
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.400]   cholesterol, everything is normal.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:12.820]   And I live the life of a shift worker just for five nights.
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:16.380]   That means I'm sleeping less, maybe four or five hours.
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:22.040]   And even if I don't eat at nighttime,
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.200]   of course, many shift workers also feel hungry
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:27.220]   and just to keep their work, they eat.
[01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:31.200]   Just after five days, my blood glucose level
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.680]   will read almost like I'm pre-diabetic.
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:36.800]   - Wow, I actually saw a study published in Prosthesis
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.040]   of the National Academy that showed
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.960]   that even 100 lux dim light present in the room
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:44.140]   while people are sleeping with eyes closed
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:48.480]   can lead to disruptions in morning blood glucose levels
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:51.040]   in directions that are not good.
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:54.360]   One night, so the faint clock in the corner
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:59.360]   or even a nightlight that's too bright could be problematic.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.520]   By the way, folks, these effects are reversible.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.360]   So whenever I say these things,
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.380]   we get a lot of comments about,
[01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:07.280]   oh my goodness, what have I been doing for years?
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:10.560]   But kids with nightlights, this is an issue.
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.000]   But what I'm hearing is that one in five people
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.340]   are truly shift workers in the classic sense.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:19.000]   Their jobs require they work at night or into the night
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.420]   and sleep into the day.
[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:25.180]   But far more people are shift workers
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:27.720]   by virtue of the fact that they're tweeting or working
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:30.720]   or watching movies at night, even though it's not work
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:33.040]   in that they're not being paid for that time.
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.040]   They are essentially operating like shift workers.
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:37.680]   If we add those two groups together,
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:41.480]   would we say it's what, a third of Americans?
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.840]   - I would say half of Americans.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:43.680]   - Half of Americans.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.280]   - Yeah, if you take teenagers,
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:48.160]   because high school students and college students,
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:51.400]   because again, going back to Horacio's study,
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:54.860]   because Horacio also collected activity data
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:56.800]   from high school students and college students,
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:59.480]   and we have replicated that with high school students
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.960]   and college students in San Diego.
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:03.280]   So that's Seattle and San Diego.
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:06.880]   And this study, now there are many sleep researchers
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:09.060]   that have been collecting this data.
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:12.780]   And what we find is typically the high school students,
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:16.280]   they are going to bed say around midnight,
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.760]   and college students, at least the UCSD students,
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:21.520]   we found maybe one out of 100
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:23.840]   who went to bed before midnight.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:26.400]   - That reminds me that Horacio Iglesias
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.620]   just published this really nice paper.
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:32.920]   Showing that counter to what we believe students,
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.700]   now this is the University of Washington in Seattle,
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:37.800]   I should mention where it's very dark in the winter,
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:40.020]   young people, these are people in their 20s,
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:42.980]   are staying up later in the winter months
[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:44.680]   compared to the summer months,
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:46.580]   which is totally counterintuitive.
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.220]   You think, okay, everyone stays up late in the summer
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.260]   and goes to bed early in the winter,
[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:51.940]   but because of artificial lighting, it's the exact opposite.
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:54.240]   - Yeah, so another means,
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.420]   I don't know whether Horacio monitored it,
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:47:00.660]   but my other suspicion, I'm not saying whether it's true,
[01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:03.500]   in winter we are more likely to consume more coffee,
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:05.340]   hot chocolate in the evening,
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:10.140]   and that might also be delaying sleep onset.
[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:10.980]   - That makes sense.
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:14.980]   - So in that way, again, here is another thing
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:18.620]   which can be related to policy
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:22.500]   or practice at educational institute.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:24.820]   So what happened during COVID
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:26.900]   was everybody went to remote learning.
[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:30.460]   The assignments became digital
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:32.900]   and assignments submission became digital.
[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:34.820]   And there are many systems,
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:37.500]   online systems that came into play.
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:41.140]   And by default, the assignments submission deadline
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:42.160]   became midnight.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:45.020]   So then now what is happening is,
[01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:47.300]   I don't know about Stanford,
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:49.860]   maybe when you are giving assignment,
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:50.700]   when is the deadline?
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:52.220]   - Midnight, typically. - Midnight.
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:54.500]   So then most of us, most students,
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.380]   they will try to cram as much as possible,
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:48:00.260]   try to solve as much as possible and submit at midnight.
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:03.100]   And it'll be really cool to go back
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:05.680]   to your system administrator to see,
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:09.780]   is there so many frequency plot of frequency distribution
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:13.860]   of what time people are submitting the assignment?
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:16.520]   Because we know, means when we submit our grant.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:20.660]   - Yeah, so I mean, you hear about the obesity crisis,
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:22.980]   the crisis of metabolic disorders,
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:24.820]   not just in the US but everywhere in the world.
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:25.700]   I mean, it's really striking.
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:27.940]   I remember going to a Keystone meeting,
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:30.260]   scientific meeting in the early 2000s,
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:31.620]   and there was a map of the United States
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:33.460]   and it showed where the obesity rates
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:35.140]   were over 30% in adults.
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:37.540]   And the entire country basically was lighting up like crazy.
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:39.060]   Now it would be the entire country,
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:41.380]   but there were these kind of zones in the middle
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:47.220]   that were almost devoid of obesity.
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:50.020]   Colorado, namely, Idaho at that time.
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:52.900]   Those are now also fallen under the umbrella
[01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:54.500]   of rampant obesity.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:58.500]   And everyone is speculating, okay, is it seed oils?
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:01.380]   Is it this, is it that?
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:02.820]   Is it highly processed foods?
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:04.340]   I'm guessing it's all of those things,
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:05.780]   including lack of activity.
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:08.180]   But one has to wonder, given everything we're talking about
[01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:11.460]   in terms of metabolic dysfunction, late shifted eating,
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:13.220]   all these issues with late shifted eating
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:15.300]   and staying up late with artificial lighting,
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:18.020]   whether or not that could be one of the major factors
[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:19.620]   in the so-called obesity crisis.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.180]   It's likely, you know, we always say freshmen 15.
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:23.220]   That's right.
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:26.740]   Because these kids are gaining 15 pounds
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:28.420]   in their freshman year in college.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:33.700]   And this is where I think as educator or professors,
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:37.860]   it'll be interesting to go back and see what can we do?
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:39.860]   Because another thing that's also becoming
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:42.100]   more and more common, for example,
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:44.740]   I give a circadian rhythm class,
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:47.220]   means I just give two lectures.
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:50.740]   And I remember when I started 15, 17 years ago,
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:55.060]   that lecture used to be around 1.30 PM
[01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:56.740]   or 2.00 PM in the afternoon.
[01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:58.420]   And it's a two and a half hour lecture.
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:49:59.780]   So it's done by five.
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.380]   And for the last, before the pandemic,
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:06.100]   I realized that they changed the timing.
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:08.820]   Now the lecture was starting at 7.00 PM.
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:12.420]   So I was finishing by nine, 9.30 PM.
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:16.500]   And these kids, they had to go and eat after 9.30.
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:17.140]   Study, socialize.
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:18.660]   Study, socialize.
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:19.700]   Fireside chat.
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:20.580]   Fireside chat.
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:21.860]   And then to express themselves,
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:24.740]   like to feel free from assignments.
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:26.340]   When are they going to do that?
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:28.420]   After they submit the assignment,
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:29.460]   then they're going to do that.
[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:33.140]   So that's why we had to go back and revisit this issue,
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:36.500]   say, okay, so for adults,
[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:38.820]   for most of us who are working a day job,
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:43.060]   our deadline is 5.00 PM in most cases, right?
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:46.500]   Means at least in university system,
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.260]   the person who is submitting the grant,
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:52.900]   who is taking care of my IRB or IR clerk,
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:54.180]   they're all living at five o'clock.
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:56.660]   So for me, everything has to end by five.
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:58.100]   I think for most people out there,
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:02.580]   so this raises a kind of macroscopic question,
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:04.420]   which is maybe it's not so much
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:05.860]   about restricting the feeding window,
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:08.660]   but maybe it's about feeding mostly
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:11.060]   and being active mostly in the early part of the day.
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:15.300]   I mean, I could imagine a time three, four years from now
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:18.660]   when waking up early and going to bed
[01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:21.780]   within three hours of sunset is the protocol,
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:24.980]   which harnesses all other protocols, right?
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:26.180]   You're going to exercise,
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:27.300]   you're going to do it in that time.
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:27.780]   You're going to eat,
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:28.740]   you're going to do it in that time.
[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:29.380]   You're going to socialize,
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:31.060]   you're going to do it in that time.
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:31.700]   And in doing so,
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.300]   you're also avoiding a lot of the issues
[01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:34.500]   related to disrupted sleep.
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.580]   - Yeah, so that's why all these things,
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:37.060]   as you said,
[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:41.620]   time ratio feeding is just one aspect of the circadian health
[01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:43.380]   and these are all interconnected.
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:44.820]   And going back to the comment about
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:47.620]   within three hours of sunset,
[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:49.700]   yes, that's good.
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:54.260]   But then what happens in say Toronto or Vancouver
[01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:54.980]   in winter time?
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:57.140]   - Well, I guess they're going to bed very, very early,
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:58.740]   but also waking up very, very early.
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:00.820]   One of the things that I hear all the time,
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:02.340]   because I'm always beating on the drum
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:03.700]   of getting morning sunlight,
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:05.460]   even if through cloud cover is people say,
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:07.860]   there's no sun here this time of year.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:10.340]   And forgive me, but there is sun,
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:11.220]   unless you live in a cave,
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:13.220]   their sun is just coming through cloud cover.
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:14.660]   No matter where you live in the world,
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:17.220]   there's sun unless you live in a cave, of course.
[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:20.020]   So I want to make sure that we didn't overlook,
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.420]   what was the major conclusion of the firefighter study?
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:23.780]   - We'll go back to the firefighter study.
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:25.940]   So the reason why we did this study was,
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:26.660]   as I said,
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:28.900]   there are a lot of us who are living the lifestyle
[01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:31.620]   of firefighters or shift workers
[01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:34.260]   and shift workers are excluded from studies.
[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:37.220]   So that means whatever we are learning about lifestyle
[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:42.260]   or even medications that may be beneficial for people
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:43.700]   who actually have a normal schedule,
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:47.860]   but not for people who have a disrupted schedule.
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:50.580]   And if you look up clinicaltrial.gov,
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:53.220]   there are more than 400,000 studies listed.
[01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:58.020]   And if you search how many studies are on shift workers,
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:52:59.620]   it's less than a thousand.
[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:01.700]   And then if you ask,
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:05.220]   most of them are to see what is wrong with shift workers.
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:08.580]   Like that's how we know that shift work increases our risk
[01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:11.700]   for metabolic disease, cancer,
[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:14.500]   and even some aspects of dementia.
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:17.860]   But if you ask how many studies are done
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:20.420]   to improve the health of shift worker alone,
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:22.500]   that's less than 50.
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:25.380]   Means I have to go back and check the actual number,
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:26.580]   but it's less than 50.
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:27.140]   - Wow.
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:30.340]   - So that's why we got super excited.
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:33.860]   We thought from circadian rhythm perspective,
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:35.620]   that's something to address.
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:40.820]   So this study, again, this kind of study is only possible
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:45.460]   because I'm at Salk and we are affiliated with UCSD
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:50.580]   and I can work with UCSD physicians to do this study.
[01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:53.620]   So I collaborate with Dr. Pam Togg,
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:57.220]   who is the director of cardiac rehab center in UCSD.
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:02.420]   And Pam has many firefighters as her patients.
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:06.420]   And we both know that the number one cause for death
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:10.180]   and disability on work for firefighters is not fighting fire,
[01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:12.820]   but just getting heart attack and stroke.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:16.740]   So they have a very high incidence of heart attack and stroke,
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:19.620]   and they're also highly prone to different kinds of cancer.
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:24.340]   And it may be difficult to ascribe cancer to disruption,
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:25.380]   circadian disruption,
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:28.180]   because they're also exposed to a lot of toxins.
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:31.620]   Anytime fire burns, that smell of fire
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:35.300]   is essentially smell of carcinogens.
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:39.300]   And they're breathing, even if they have the hood on
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:41.060]   and respirator, they still get.
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:43.140]   So the idea was very simple.
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:48.180]   We know that firefighters, nearly 70% of firefighters
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:50.420]   in the US, full-time firefighters,
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:52.820]   because there are volunteer firefighters
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:54.260]   and then full-time firefighters.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:56.100]   The full-time firefighters,
[01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:59.140]   70% of them work 24 hours shift.
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:01.860]   So for example, in San Diego,
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:02.900]   they come in at,
[01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:05.620]   their shift is from 8 AM to 8 AM the next day.
[01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:08.580]   And they do, at least in San Diego,
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:11.860]   they do one day on, one day off, on, off,
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:13.700]   four cycles, and then four days off.
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:17.860]   And, but in some fire departments,
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:19.860]   they actually do 48 hours shift.
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:22.900]   So they come for two days, two days off,
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:25.620]   two days, two days off, and then four or five days off.
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:27.620]   Brutal. Thank you, firefighters.
[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:31.700]   Yeah. I mean, so then the idea was,
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.940]   okay, so we'll screen firefighters
[01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:35.300]   and then find firefighters
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:38.500]   who are metabolically unhealthy,
[01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:40.980]   and then we'll see whether they can actually follow
[01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:43.540]   10 hours time restricted eating.
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:46.980]   Because the point is if firefighters can follow it,
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:48.260]   then everybody else will be,
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:51.060]   because with all that stress, if they can.
[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:54.660]   And this is again, where I should also acknowledge
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:56.660]   the San Diego Fire and Rescue Department,
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.020]   because without their help,
[01:55:58.020 --> 01:55:59.860]   we could not have even submitted the grant.
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:02.740]   And at that time, David Picon,
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:06.020]   who is the Health and Wellness Battalion Chief,
[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:08.660]   he's the one who actually approached us
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:12.340]   because he's very careful.
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:16.180]   He knew that the job that they do
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:20.660]   makes them weaker in the long term
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:22.580]   and can kill them in long term.
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:25.540]   So he was always looking for new solutions.
[01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:27.780]   So he approached us and then we said,
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:28.980]   this is the idea.
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:30.500]   He said, well, I love this idea
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:34.100]   because we are not asking them to sleep more,
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:36.980]   or we are not going to cut down their overtime
[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:39.060]   or shift or change the work schedule.
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:41.060]   The only thing we'll be doing is ask them
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:42.580]   to eat within 10 hours.
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:44.740]   And hopefully we can do this.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:46.340]   Consistently between the days
[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:47.860]   that they're working and not working?
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:48.340]   Yes.
[01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:51.780]   So that means if they're from 8 a.m. to 8 a.m. working,
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:53.460]   then they go home,
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:55.940]   then they're going to eat on the same schedule
[01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:57.940]   they did when they were at the firehouse,
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:56:59.460]   but while at home.
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:02.180]   So they're not allowing themselves to deviate from that.
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:02.420]   Yeah.
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:05.140]   So we thought whether they can do it or not,
[01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:08.500]   because the number one goal or the primary outcome
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:11.300]   in this clinical trial was feasibility.
[01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:12.100]   Can they do it?
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:14.660]   And then second was if they do it,
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:16.980]   then what happens to their blood sugar and weight
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:17.860]   and all this other stuff?
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:22.020]   And then we started the study and we hit the next hurdle.
[01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:22.740]   And that is,
[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:29.300]   firefighters are very, very tight knit community,
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:32.660]   and they want to make sure that you understand their culture.
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:34.580]   And the best way to understand their culture
[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:37.220]   is to live the life of a firefighter.
[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:40.260]   So Emily Manoogian, who is the first author,
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:43.140]   she, and then we had Adina Jadurian,
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.180]   who is now in med school.
[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:46.580]   She was a research coordinator at that time.
[01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:48.100]   They volunteered.
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:51.140]   They said, "Okay, we'll go to the biggest fire station
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:54.580]   in San Diego and we'll live the life of a firefighter."
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:58.340]   And the San Diego fire and rescue and the city,
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:01.380]   they all agreed.
[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:04.020]   They reported for duty at 7.30 in the morning.
[01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:06.660]   They were assigned a bed in the station
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:09.780]   because all fire stations do have some beds
[01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:12.500]   for firefighters to rest and they have assigned beds.
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:13.540]   So they were assigned a bed.
[01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:18.340]   Yeah, so every time a 911 call came,
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:19.780]   and if that fire station,
[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:22.100]   in that fire station, that fire engine was called,
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:24.100]   then just like other firefighters,
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:26.100]   they had to run, get into the gears,
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:29.780]   adjust the shoes and a jacket and a helmet
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:32.500]   and get into the seat and attend the call.
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:33.940]   Of course, they won't go to the side.
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:37.300]   They just get out of the truck, wait there and come back.
[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:40.820]   So in that 24 hours,
[01:58:40.820 --> 01:58:46.260]   Emily got 10 calls at night that she had to run to,
[01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:47.860]   but there are more than 10 times.
[01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:52.340]   Every time the 911 call came,
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:54.260]   then there is a beep that goes out.
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:57.060]   All firefighters who are sleeping or resting,
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:59.220]   they'll get up or if they're doing something,
[01:58:59.220 --> 01:59:01.620]   they'll look up to see which engine is called.
[01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:02.980]   Interesting.
[01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:04.900]   So it's not just the ones that go out.
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:06.500]   It's everyone gets woken up.
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:07.620]   Everyone gets woken up.
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:09.620]   So that means in a night, typical night,
[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:14.020]   they're waking up 10, 15, 20 times sometimes.
[01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:17.940]   So they're almost like, new moms are like firefighters
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:19.460]   because they don't have any idea
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:23.620]   what time the baby will cry and for what reason.
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:24.340]   Also, they don't know.
[01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:25.940]   So similarly, it's five.
[01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:28.180]   So that's what Emily did.
[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:31.300]   And then next morning, once he came back, she was like, no.
[01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:32.660]   The scratch will seem easy.
[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:38.340]   So then we did the study and we essentially assigned
[01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:41.620]   all the firefighters, we recruited 150 firefighters.
[01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:46.580]   We assigned half of them to Mediterranean diet
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:48.020]   because you cannot do any harm.
[01:59:48.020 --> 01:59:49.540]   You have to give them something good.
[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:50.500]   So that's another thing.
[01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:52.500]   They said, no, we want something that we know
[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:53.780]   works for firefighters.
[01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:55.380]   And there was a Mediterranean diet study.
[01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:59.220]   So everybody was supposed to follow Mediterranean diet
[01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:00.980]   and then half, nearly 75 of them,
[02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:03.620]   were supposed to eat within 10 hours.
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:08.980]   We did not fix the 10 hours because we said,
[02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:12.100]   you pick your own 10 hours that you can stick to.
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:13.940]   But it has to be consistent from day to day.
[02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:18.100]   So if you start eating at 9 AM, you finish it at 7 PM.
[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:23.140]   And then try to be consistent because we said, yes,
[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:25.060]   we understand that there will be some things
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:28.420]   and you can take maybe half an hour here and there.
[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:30.260]   And we'll see how many times you can do it.
[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:34.740]   And what is interesting is how they are all doing
[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:35.700]   24 hour shift.
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:39.540]   They more or less chose to begin eating somewhere
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:41.380]   between 8 AM and 11 AM.
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:46.740]   And they did not skip any meal.
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:49.460]   They had their first meal or what we call breakfast.
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:51.940]   But it was several hours after waking up
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:53.860]   because they are waking up at five or six
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:57.460]   and they're driving to come to work at 7.30 or eight
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:01.220]   and they're eating the first meal, say between 8 and 11.
[02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:04.980]   And then they finished meal 10 hours later.
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:10.420]   And what we found is more or less most of them
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:14.660]   could stick to doing this at least five days
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:15.540]   out of seven days.
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:18.820]   And then at the end of the study,
[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:21.220]   when we look at their health parameters,
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:25.540]   one thing that I said, we recruited everybody who can.
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:29.700]   So that means nearly one in three firefighters
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:30.660]   were completely healthy.
[02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:35.460]   They had no sign of any illness,
[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:37.220]   no high blood pressure, high blood sugar,
[02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:39.620]   high cholesterol, depression or anything.
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:42.580]   So since we have one third of the population
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:43.700]   who are already healthy
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:46.820]   and then everybody has slightly different conditions.
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.340]   Some have high blood pressure,
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:50.020]   but they don't have high blood glucose.
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:51.860]   If somebody has high blood glucose,
[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:53.140]   but not high blood pressure.
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:55.460]   So it is kind of heterogeneous.
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:59.380]   So we did not see a big difference in weight loss
[02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:01.620]   or any weight change between these two groups.
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:05.140]   Another thing is the firefighters actually run
[02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:08.820]   almost eight to nine miles when they're at the job
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:12.260]   because that's part of their exercise routine.
[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:17.220]   But then one thing that changed significantly
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:18.900]   in the time-restricted eating group
[02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:23.940]   was what we call VLDL particle size and particle number
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:26.180]   because this is something that we know
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:28.980]   is very low density lipoprotein.
[02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:32.500]   These are atherogenic and if we can manage them much better
[02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:35.300]   then we reduce the risk for atherosclerosis.
[02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:37.940]   So that's one parameter that changed
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:40.100]   in the time-restricted feeding group
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:42.820]   even when you combine all healthy, unhealthy, everybody.
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:48.580]   Now, if we take firefighters who are beginning
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:50.340]   with high blood pressure,
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:55.140]   then we saw significant reduction in their systolic
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:56.980]   as well as diastolic blood pressure.
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:59.060]   And the change in blood pressure,
[02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:01.460]   of course, we don't claim that in the manuscript,
[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:04.340]   but when we talk about it, some physician would get up
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:06.260]   and say, "Wow, that looks like almost there
[02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:08.420]   on a blood pressure lowering drug."
[02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:12.420]   So the extent of blood pressure lowering is equivalent
[02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:14.980]   to somebody taking an anti-hypertensive drug.
[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:15.540]   Amazing.
[02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:15.940]   Yeah.
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:18.180]   And then those who started with high blood sugar,
[02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:20.580]   of course, we didn't have too many type 2 diabetes,
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:22.820]   but there are few pre-diabetic
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:26.100]   and they could better manage their blood glucose.
[02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:30.820]   And this is interesting because once shift workers
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:33.780]   become pre-diabetic or diabetic,
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:37.380]   they have more difficulty managing their blood sugar
[02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:41.220]   than non-shift workers because the work schedule itself
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:42.980]   will mess them up too much.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:45.780]   Even if they're on many medications, they have difficulty.
[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:47.540]   That's fascinating.
[02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:49.860]   And I'm really glad that you explained the study
[02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:52.020]   in such detail, because I would have thought,
[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:55.220]   from reading the abstract, and I did look at the data,
[02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:56.740]   but if someone were to look at the abstract,
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:57.700]   they'd say, "Oh, firefighters."
[02:03:57.700 --> 02:03:58.900]   So they're waking up in the middle of the night
[02:03:58.900 --> 02:04:01.300]   and they're throwing on their gear
[02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:02.660]   and going out to calls and do it.
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:04.980]   But if I understand correctly,
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:07.140]   all firefighters are being woken up by the signal,
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:09.860]   which makes the firefighter population
[02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:13.300]   a bit more similar to the more standard population
[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:14.420]   who's waking up in the middle of the night
[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:16.820]   to use the bathroom, getting on social media
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:18.660]   for a couple of minutes or flipping on the lights.
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:20.420]   I mean, it's maybe not as severe
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:21.620]   as what firefighters are doing,
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:26.260]   but we know there are blood sugar regulation issues
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:28.740]   related to those multiple middle of the night wakings,
[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:30.900]   especially if people are then staring at screens.
[02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:34.340]   So I think it's really important that people
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:37.460]   were able to hear about the deeper contours of the study.
[02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:41.060]   I mean, this result of regulating blood sugar better
[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:41.860]   is really powerful.
[02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:44.660]   I get asked all the time, "I've got a new kid,"
[02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:46.260]   or "I'm a shift worker.
[02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.020]   How can I do this morning sunlight viewing?"
[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:50.820]   What I'm hearing is that keeping
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:52.820]   a regular meal schedule every day-
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:55.220]   - At least five out of seven.
[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:57.220]   - Five out of seven, or as close to every day.
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:58.340]   Sort of like sleep, I always say,
[02:04:58.340 --> 02:04:59.700]   try and get a really great night's sleep,
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.780]   80% or more of the nights of your life.
[02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:04.740]   And on the other 20%, hopefully it's for fun reasons,
[02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:06.180]   a great party or something like that,
[02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:07.620]   or a celebration of some sort.
[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:13.140]   That seems to me a great anchor point
[02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:16.980]   when one can't reliably control their sleep-wake cycle.
[02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:20.020]   Does that mean that if somebody is coming off
[02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:22.500]   of shift work and they're very, very tired,
[02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:24.660]   that they would be better off staying awake
[02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:26.260]   and eating than sleeping?
[02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:30.260]   - Well, yeah, so this is where we get into the nuances.
[02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:33.140]   So here, the firefighters are 24-hour shift workers.
[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:36.100]   So that means, and they have been working the shift
[02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:39.060]   for a very long time, so they have figured out.
[02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:42.100]   And one thing is, yes, firefighters are different
[02:05:42.100 --> 02:05:44.660]   from nurses and healthcare workers
[02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:46.820]   who have to work throughout the night
[02:05:46.820 --> 02:05:48.420]   and they're staying awake throughout the night.
[02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:51.060]   Whereas firefighters, they get opportunity to sleep.
[02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:56.580]   Even with their 10 calls, they actually have opportunity
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:58.500]   to come back and go to sleep.
[02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:01.380]   And in fact, when Emily and Adina,
[02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:03.460]   they were in the fire station, what they observed was,
[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:07.060]   firefighters after attending a call,
[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:08.740]   they're not coming back and playing cards
[02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:11.700]   or trying to watch the news or get the score.
[02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:16.580]   They know, they will just go back and lie in the bed
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:17.940]   and switch up the light.
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:20.580]   So whenever they got any opportunity to sleep,
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:21.460]   they would try to sleep.
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:26.420]   So in that way, their sleep debt and sleep pressure
[02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:30.980]   during daytime is not as strong as a night shift nurse
[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:35.060]   or a truck driver who is driving all night
[02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:37.620]   because they are staying awake throughout the night.
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:40.820]   So when people say, yes, you found this
[02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:43.140]   and can you extend it to other shift workers?
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:44.260]   My answer is no.
[02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:46.580]   We have to go back and figure out.
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:48.500]   That's why we went to the station
[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:50.340]   and figured out what would work for them.
[02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:54.340]   If I have to go and do this for some nurses,
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:57.780]   maybe even I will go or our staff will go
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:06:59.700]   and figure out what is their work schedule?
[02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:00.260]   What happens?
[02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:02.340]   Do they have opportunity to eat?
[02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:05.860]   Do they have opportunity to even take five minutes break?
[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:07.460]   What do they do during break?
[02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:09.940]   And all of these things come into play.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:13.060]   But here, another thing is I always said
[02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:14.900]   that in other time-restricted feeding paper,
[02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:17.620]   we see change in nutrition quality and quantity.
[02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:21.860]   But here, we also saw that somehow both groups
[02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:26.420]   inadvertently improved their nutrition quality
[02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:30.340]   because everybody was told to eat Mediterranean diet.
[02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:32.100]   They increased their fruits and vegetables
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:34.340]   and olive oil slightly.
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:40.260]   And when they had to stop eating early,
[02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:43.460]   they also reduced their alcohol intake.
[02:07:43.460 --> 02:07:48.020]   And this is very significant because many shift workers,
[02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:49.620]   just to cope with the shift work,
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:52.980]   they tend to depend on alcohol at night
[02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:54.900]   and caffeine in the morning.
[02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:59.220]   So they begin their day with caffeine and end with alcohol.
[02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:04.820]   And now we can relate that many normal people
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:06.340]   who are not doing shift work,
[02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:08.980]   we also more or less begin our day with caffeine.
[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:11.460]   And many of us end with alcohol.
[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:14.660]   And then when they reduce that eating to 10 hours,
[02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:17.780]   and then we saw a significant reduction in alcohol intake
[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:20.580]   in the time ratio eating group,
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:24.180]   but not in the standard of care or Mediterranean diet group.
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:25.300]   I certainly support that.
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:26.580]   We did an episode on alcohol,
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:29.300]   and I was shocked when I researched that
[02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:32.980]   to learn that zero to two drinks per week
[02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:34.980]   is essentially the threshold beyond which
[02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:38.420]   you start seeing health deficits,
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:40.900]   in particular cancers and metabolic disruption,
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:43.700]   sleep disruption, and increased anxiety
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:45.540]   when people aren't under the influence of alcohol.
[02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:48.100]   I mean, it's pretty incredible how alcohol
[02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:51.460]   has kind of escaped as the opposite of caffeine
[02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:54.420]   and therefore not a health hazard.
[02:08:54.420 --> 02:08:56.100]   It's, and here I'm somebody,
[02:08:56.100 --> 02:08:57.300]   I have a drink every once in a while,
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:08:59.700]   no big deal for me, I can have it or not have it,
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:03.460]   but it's just striking how alcohol,
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:06.260]   despite extensive data that it can really disrupt health,
[02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:10.740]   even at three drinks per week is just avidly consumed
[02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:12.980]   as if it was kind of like food or caffeine.
[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:14.100]   It's really incredible.
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:16.660]   I want to make sure that I circle back
[02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:17.780]   to something you mentioned earlier,
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:18.740]   because I know there are going to be
[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:20.180]   a number of people that asked this.
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:23.220]   If I recall, you said that provided
[02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:27.380]   that the feeding window is not shorter than eight hours,
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:31.620]   that men, women, and children can use
[02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:34.580]   time-restricted feeding, is that right?
[02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:38.100]   Yeah, so what I say is 12 hours.
[02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:39.860]   Excuse me, 12 hours.
[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:41.220]   Thank you for that clarification.
[02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:43.940]   Because we did a study that was published in 2015.
[02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:48.740]   And again, behind many of our studies, there is a story.
[02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:51.860]   So we are publishing all these mouse stories,
[02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:53.780]   and then I would go to conferences.
[02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:59.140]   And then of course, some people would give me a look saying,
[02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:00.500]   well, you must be doing something wrong.
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:06.100]   We, this just breaks the X law of thermodynamics,
[02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:08.100]   because how come they're eating the same number of calories
[02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:09.380]   and not getting weight?
[02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:11.060]   And of course, by that time we figured out
[02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:13.140]   that at least in mouse,
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:17.860]   time-restricted feeding also changes the gut microbiome
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:21.460]   in a way that the mice may be pooping out
[02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:25.860]   a little bit more fat and sugar than absorbing them.
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:28.260]   So one thing that happens in time-restricted feeding,
[02:10:28.260 --> 02:10:33.460]   at least in mice, is the liver cholesterol metabolism
[02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:38.980]   to bile acid and bile acids excretion in the gut changes
[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:41.700]   because the gut microbiome changes.
[02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:44.500]   So this is a very nice study.
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.980]   When Amir Jarinpar was in the lab,
[02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:49.300]   now he has his own lab in UCSD.
[02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:51.860]   And he meticulously did that.
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:55.540]   And we even did bomb calorimetry from the poop
[02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:58.020]   and metabolomics from the poop.
[02:10:58.020 --> 02:11:02.580]   And then we figured out that they excrete some calories
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:05.540]   and then that brown fat activity goes up.
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:08.900]   So they may be burning some of these extra calories.
[02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:10.020]   So they're more thermogenic.
[02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:10.900]   More thermogenic.
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:16.100]   But anyway, so one nice thing, awesome thing about Salk
[02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:19.860]   is if they see that your science is going well,
[02:11:19.860 --> 02:11:22.020]   then they will find ways to help you.
[02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:22.900]   - That's terrific.
[02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:23.400]   - Yeah.
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:28.020]   And this is when Bill Brody was our president.
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:31.940]   He was the president of Hopkins for 12 years.
[02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:33.060]   And then he was president.
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:38.820]   And that time he had started this innovation grant program
[02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:40.900]   which was funded by Orwin Jacob.
[02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:43.940]   Orwin is the founder of Qualcomm.
[02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:46.340]   And he was also a faculty at UCSD.
[02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:49.860]   So he understand there are very few tech leaders
[02:11:49.860 --> 02:11:52.420]   who actually spend some time in academia.
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:56.820]   So he understood the pain of getting grant money
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:11:59.460]   when you have some interesting idea or test some ideas.
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:02.260]   - Yeah, no knock on the NIH, but I'll do it anyway.
[02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:04.980]   Because I sit on study section for the NIH.
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:07.380]   I mean, the NIH wants to see proposals for things
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:10.820]   that are so certain to work that they're mostly done.
[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:14.580]   And so really groundbreaking work can happen
[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:16.340]   and does happen with NIH funding.
[02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:20.340]   But more often than not is it is the generosity
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:22.660]   of philanthropists like Orwin Jacobs and other people
[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:26.420]   that allow the really pioneering, the new stuff,
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:28.820]   the cool stuff, the groundbreaking stuff,
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:30.020]   the stuff that really...
[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:31.220]   No, I'm not going to say really matters.
[02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:31.940]   It all matters.
[02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:32.660]   It's all important.
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:35.300]   - It matters, but it's high risk.
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:39.140]   And NIH means NIH is not just government
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:40.820]   is not making money from thin air,
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:42.420]   means it's taxpayers' money.
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:45.300]   So there is a little bit responsibility or conservative
[02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:47.940]   that, okay, so we should not waste taxpayers' money
[02:12:47.940 --> 02:12:50.100]   on pie in the sky kind of project too much.
[02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:50.980]   - To be clear, we're not talking
[02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:52.180]   about politically conservative.
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:55.300]   We're talking about scientifically conservative.
[02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:57.380]   They'd be so careful with language nowadays.
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:59.300]   Pretty soon we're just going to sit and stare at one another
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:00.740]   at the microphones to stay safe.
[02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:03.060]   So that's interesting.
[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:03.460]   So the-
[02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:07.220]   - So then we started this and then what we did was we...
[02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:11.780]   I had an awesome grad student and we got this funding
[02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:13.780]   from Irwin and also there are some...
[02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:16.020]   Any philanthropy matters.
[02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:20.180]   So actually the way we say is, yes, if you give me 50 bucks,
[02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:23.300]   then that 50 bucks goes towards buying the gloves
[02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:27.060]   and effing of tubes for one postdoc for maybe seven days.
[02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:28.580]   - So true.
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:32.420]   I think a lot of people don't realize that 99%
[02:13:32.420 --> 02:13:35.380]   of laboratory scientists just, they don't make any money
[02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:36.260]   off their discoveries.
[02:13:36.260 --> 02:13:38.420]   And even if there is a patentable discovery,
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:40.820]   typically the divide between the institution
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:43.220]   and the company that will eventually put that to market
[02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:46.900]   is so slim in favor of the others involved
[02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:50.020]   that scientists really do this as a work of passion,
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:51.140]   labor of love.
[02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:55.220]   - So we came up with this app, My security and clock
[02:13:55.220 --> 02:14:00.420]   at that time, and we took some lessons from tech leaders,
[02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:03.780]   particularly from Amazon, one-click checkout
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:09.780]   because we thought most nutrition apps actually ask people
[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:13.860]   to detail describe what they ate, go to their food library
[02:14:13.860 --> 02:14:14.980]   and then portion size.
[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:17.380]   We said, okay, so we'll just shortcut all of that.
[02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:19.860]   We just asked people to take a picture of the food,
[02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:24.340]   open the app, one click, take a picture, second click
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:25.780]   and press save, third click.
[02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:28.020]   And when they save, the picture actually came to our server,
[02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:29.460]   did not stay on their phone.
[02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:34.900]   And we asked 156 people who are not shift workers,
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:38.340]   just regular worker or homemakers to be part of the study.
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:41.540]   No student was allowed to be part of the study
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:44.900]   because we know that lifestyle is like shift workers.
[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:47.860]   And we monitored for three weeks.
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:53.060]   And so here is some nuances and I want people to understand.
[02:14:53.060 --> 02:14:59.620]   So suppose when somebody is starting to eat at say 7 AM
[02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:04.020]   and since they're recording everything,
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:06.100]   we caught every single thing.
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:08.740]   Even if they ate half a cookie, they had to take a picture
[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:11.460]   and they actually took picture because it's not,
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:13.540]   it becomes second nature after three or four days
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:15.060]   that every time they ate something,
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:16.660]   even if there was a glass of water,
[02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:18.660]   they actually took a picture because we asked them,
[02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:21.140]   take picture of everything, we'll figure out what it is.
[02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:26.180]   What is surprising was we found the median,
[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:31.300]   so the median number of times people eat within a day,
[02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:33.140]   24 hours a day is actually seven.
[02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:37.860]   So it's not that we are eating three times a day.
[02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:39.860]   We actually snack a little bit.
[02:15:39.860 --> 02:15:41.060]   Seven times per day.
[02:15:41.060 --> 02:15:41.620]   Seven times.
[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:43.620]   And there are 10% of people,
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:47.780]   the top decile was eating 12 times a day.
[02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:48.280]   Wow.
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:52.580]   And it makes sense in retrospect sometimes.
[02:15:52.580 --> 02:15:54.740]   Maybe I'll fall into that seven or eight
[02:15:54.740 --> 02:15:58.180]   before I did this study because, you know,
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:16:01.780]   getting up, having coffee with cream and sugar is one.
[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:04.580]   And then I ate my breakfast, that's two.
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:07.540]   Then I came to the lab and I found that cookie, that's three.
[02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:10.820]   And I went to a meeting and there was some cookie
[02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:12.020]   and something else.
[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:14.500]   That's another one, then lunch.
[02:16:14.500 --> 02:16:16.900]   And then afternoon, somebody asked me to go out
[02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:17.940]   and have a meeting.
[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:21.060]   And so if you think about it, it's very normal
[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:23.620]   that we can go seven to eight times, 10 times.
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:29.300]   But then if we look at what time, say, I start breakfast,
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:32.180]   and as I said, and we see that in many people,
[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:33.940]   they'll start at seven o'clock in one day,
[02:16:33.940 --> 02:16:37.140]   then 7.30 another day, then 8.15 another day.
[02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:40.260]   Or they go back to 6 a.m. because they had to get up early
[02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:40.820]   and go to work.
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:44.820]   So we took all these food data from three weeks
[02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:48.500]   and then ask, what is the time when your body system
[02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:50.740]   is expecting you to eat?
[02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:52.260]   Because it kind of averages out.
[02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:54.900]   It's kind of thinking, okay, maybe for you,
[02:16:54.900 --> 02:16:58.500]   if you're eating breakfast at, say, somewhere between 6 a.m.,
[02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:02.500]   7.30, 7.45, 8, maybe you are expecting food
[02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:03.860]   around seven o'clock.
[02:17:03.860 --> 02:17:06.180]   Let's forget about 6.15, that's an outlier.
[02:17:06.180 --> 02:17:07.780]   And then similarly, at the end of the day,
[02:17:07.780 --> 02:17:11.220]   somebody is eating, finishing the last bite
[02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:13.060]   or the nightcap, whatever you call it,
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:18.900]   say, one day at 9 p.m., 9.30 p.m., 10, 11, 12.30, or one.
[02:17:18.900 --> 02:17:21.300]   Let's ignore that one and 12.30.
[02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:26.340]   But still, we got somewhere between seven to 11.30
[02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:28.580]   for that person over three weeks time.
[02:17:28.580 --> 02:17:32.260]   So this is how we kind of figure out what is the likelihood
[02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:34.420]   that your body will encounter food.
[02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:39.700]   So when we do that, what we found was nearly 50% of adults
[02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:43.460]   in our study ate for 14 hours, 45 minutes,
[02:17:43.460 --> 02:17:46.020]   that window when your body is expecting food.
[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:50.100]   So it's easy to say that 50% of adults
[02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:53.700]   are eating within 15 hours or longer.
[02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:55.000]   Wow.
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.140]   And quite frequently throughout that year.
[02:17:57.140 --> 02:17:58.180]   Quite frequently, too.
[02:17:58.180 --> 02:18:01.940]   And then if we ask what fraction of our adults
[02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:06.020]   were actually eating the conventional within 12 hours,
[02:18:06.020 --> 02:18:08.580]   three meals a day or something like that, it was 10%.
[02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:12.740]   So snacking has gone up dramatically,
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:14.180]   however you want to define snacking,
[02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:16.660]   the frequency of food intake throughout the day.
[02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:19.700]   And outside this breakfast, lunch, and dinner,
[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:21.460]   there are all these small snacks here and there.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:24.340]   And also for a lot of people, the dinner is delayed.
[02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:26.660]   And we went back and looked at, okay,
[02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:28.980]   so what kind of food people are eating late at night
[02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:30.180]   and all that stuff.
[02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:34.340]   And what came out interesting, which is very counter-intuitive,
[02:18:34.340 --> 02:18:36.820]   is people who prepare their own dinner,
[02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:40.020]   they're more likely to eat later at night
[02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:41.860]   because they're coming home.
[02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:44.740]   And then they're taking some time to prepare dinner.
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:47.300]   And then they're sitting down and eating,
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:49.620]   or maybe they're eating next to the computer, whatever it is.
[02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:52.340]   So it was kind of interesting that came out.
[02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:55.140]   But coming back to your point,
[02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:58.820]   that's why I say that nearly 90% of adults
[02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:02.100]   are eating for more than 12 hours.
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:05.460]   So that means a lot of people can,
[02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:09.300]   there is scope or there is enough head space
[02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:11.220]   to reduce and eat within.
[02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:15.700]   So as I said, all of this are interrelated.
[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:17.140]   So when you think about children,
[02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:22.260]   most sleep researchers agree that children and teenagers
[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:25.620]   should sleep somewhere between nine to 10 or 11 hours,
[02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:28.660]   because young children, even five to 10 year old,
[02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.420]   they should sleep nine to 10 hours.
[02:19:30.420 --> 02:19:33.460]   They're just pumping out growth hormone and growing, growing, growing.
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:37.140]   And then the teenagers, actually the recommendation is
[02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:38.740]   they should be sleeping nine hours,
[02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:41.380]   because if you take teenagers,
[02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:44.900]   take out all the stimulatory inputs to them
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:47.540]   and then remove homework assignment and everything,
[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:51.620]   and then let them kind of equilibrate to their homeostasis,
[02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:54.340]   what they're likely, how many hours they're likely to sleep,
[02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:56.980]   that turns out to be somewhere between
[02:19:56.980 --> 02:19:58.580]   eight and a half to nine and a half hours.
[02:19:58.580 --> 02:20:04.100]   Which also means that going back to sleep,
[02:20:04.100 --> 02:20:10.340]   nearly 90% of high school students in this country
[02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:11.780]   are chronically sleep deprived,
[02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:13.940]   because most high school students
[02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:16.340]   don't get nine hours of sleep on a regular basis,
[02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:17.140]   maybe in the weekend.
[02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:20.340]   Probably because of devices, they're on iPads.
[02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:23.140]   And also, as I said, this new idea
[02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:26.500]   that midnight is your assignment submission time.
[02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:28.820]   I'll come back to that again and again.
[02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:29.940]   I'm hearing that again and again.
[02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:31.300]   So teachers, take note.
[02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:34.020]   It's a very interesting idea as a way
[02:20:34.020 --> 02:20:36.260]   to kind of anchor behavior earlier in the day.
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:40.340]   I mean, public health is complicated
[02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:43.300]   because people are incentivized by fear,
[02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:46.340]   but you get more bees with honey, as they say, right?
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:50.580]   There's incentivizing people to wake earlier,
[02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:52.020]   not necessarily with the sunrise,
[02:20:52.020 --> 02:20:54.580]   but wake earlier and go to sleep earlier
[02:20:54.580 --> 02:20:57.300]   and eat within an eight to 12 hour window.
[02:20:57.300 --> 02:21:01.620]   12 if it's children.
[02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:01.940]   Yeah.
[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:04.980]   It sounds to me like all these health benefits
[02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:06.820]   are what I think are going to incentivize people
[02:21:06.820 --> 02:21:09.060]   more than, for instance, this idea that,
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:09.940]   well, if you don't do this,
[02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:12.180]   you're going to get dementia or something of that sort.
[02:21:12.180 --> 02:21:12.820]   Right.
[02:21:12.820 --> 02:21:15.060]   Like every day, people will feel more healthy
[02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:16.100]   and more productive.
[02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:19.220]   And so that's why I said that even if children
[02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:20.740]   are supposed to sleep for nine hours,
[02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:22.660]   of course, they're not eating during those nine hours.
[02:21:24.100 --> 02:21:27.140]   And we're not feeding children and putting them down to sleep
[02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:29.380]   because their core body temperature will be high,
[02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:30.740]   they cannot fall asleep.
[02:21:30.740 --> 02:21:33.220]   So at least they should have their last meal
[02:21:33.220 --> 02:21:34.900]   one or two hours before going to bed,
[02:21:34.900 --> 02:21:38.820]   because typically parents feed them
[02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:41.220]   and maybe give them a shower or a bath,
[02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:43.300]   and then they read the bedtime story.
[02:21:43.300 --> 02:21:45.860]   So it's one to two hours before bedtime,
[02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:46.980]   they're finishing food.
[02:21:46.980 --> 02:21:50.260]   Similarly, on the other hand, after they wake up,
[02:21:50.260 --> 02:21:52.660]   it's not that we're waking them up and then feeding them.
[02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:55.540]   So hopefully we're not doing that.
[02:21:55.540 --> 02:22:00.180]   So that's at 12 hours seems to be optimum.
[02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:01.700]   And it's not only I'm saying that
[02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:04.820]   if we put all the health recommendations together
[02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:07.620]   from pediatrician, then it makes sense.
[02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:10.180]   Fascinating.
[02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:12.740]   I have a question about structuring meal intake
[02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:15.620]   or food intake during the eating window.
[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:17.460]   I have a good friend.
[02:22:17.460 --> 02:22:20.980]   Actually, he's the neurosurgeon at Neuralink now,
[02:22:20.980 --> 02:22:22.580]   but he came up through Stanford
[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:26.020]   and he has a habit of eating,
[02:22:26.020 --> 02:22:29.140]   of skipping one meal per day within a feeding window.
[02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:31.780]   So it might be breakfast, lunch, skip dinner one day.
[02:22:31.780 --> 02:22:34.180]   Then it might be breakfast, dinner the next day,
[02:22:34.180 --> 02:22:36.740]   lunch and dinner the next one.
[02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:39.780]   So it's not in keeping with the same start time always,
[02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:42.580]   but the end time is either going to be earlier
[02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:45.220]   or there's a gate, it's never later.
[02:22:45.220 --> 02:22:46.500]   It's never later.
[02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:49.380]   What do you think about that as a strategy?
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:53.220]   In many ways, it feels like that fits
[02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:56.260]   with the way that a lot of people's lives run.
[02:22:56.260 --> 02:22:58.340]   So sometimes, for instance, if I'm in a podcast,
[02:22:58.340 --> 02:22:59.780]   I don't tend to eat much during the middle of the day
[02:22:59.780 --> 02:23:01.460]   'cause it makes me a little bit groggy,
[02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:03.780]   the post-perennial dip in energy.
[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:05.220]   So I'll do breakfast.
[02:23:05.220 --> 02:23:07.220]   Well, again, at 11 and that's the first,
[02:23:07.220 --> 02:23:09.300]   that's when I break my fast, 11-ish.
[02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:12.100]   And then dinner, maybe a snack in the middle of the day,
[02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:13.860]   but other days it's three meals.
[02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:16.980]   So does it matter overall
[02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:20.900]   as long as one isn't allowing the start time
[02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:22.660]   and the ending time to drift out?
[02:23:22.660 --> 02:23:26.260]   Is it okay if you go from 12 hours to 10 to eight,
[02:23:26.260 --> 02:23:28.660]   eight, 10, four, 12,
[02:23:28.660 --> 02:23:32.580]   as long as you don't exceed the brackets, are you okay?
[02:23:32.580 --> 02:23:35.380]   So this is where the circadian aspect come in
[02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:39.780]   because if you're moving that breakfast time
[02:23:39.780 --> 02:23:41.940]   or dinner time, three, four hours,
[02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:45.940]   you're essentially causing maybe a metabolic jet lag.
[02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:51.780]   In short term, in weeks, months, or maybe even few years,
[02:23:51.780 --> 02:23:53.300]   you may not see any change.
[02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:55.780]   But at the same time,
[02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:58.180]   we don't know what is the long-term consequences.
[02:23:58.180 --> 02:23:59.300]   One thing is we always think,
[02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:02.260]   I'll come back to this point again and again,
[02:24:02.260 --> 02:24:04.980]   we think that our body weight is a marker of health.
[02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:07.700]   Our body composition is a marker of health.
[02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:10.180]   It's not always true because as I said,
[02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:17.620]   it should reflux feeling having some pang of depression or anxiety.
[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:19.300]   Or LDL, like high LDL.
[02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:19.940]   High LDL.
[02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:23.460]   A lot of thin people or low body fat people have very high LDL.
[02:24:23.460 --> 02:24:24.020]   Yeah.
[02:24:24.020 --> 02:24:28.180]   So those are the things that we don't connect with our habit.
[02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:31.540]   And since circadian rhythm and meal timing,
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:35.540]   meal structure now is a very new field,
[02:24:35.540 --> 02:24:39.780]   I think good studies will come out only in a few years
[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:41.300]   because right now people are just going back
[02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:43.860]   and retrospectively looking at some diet record,
[02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:47.540]   one day of diet record and trying to glean too much out of it.
[02:24:47.540 --> 02:24:53.220]   But I think hopefully things will improve where it will become standard
[02:24:53.220 --> 02:24:56.260]   to at least look for one week of diet record.
[02:24:56.260 --> 02:24:59.540]   Meal time and what they're eating, all that stuff,
[02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:03.060]   because there are now mouse studies also showing
[02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:08.660]   whether front-loading carbohydrate or front-loading fat or protein
[02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:10.180]   has benefit over.
[02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:12.500]   So I think these studies are starting.
[02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:16.340]   So I should not comment whether that's good or bad.
[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:19.940]   No, I think it's great to hold off until then we have you back on to discuss.
[02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:24.260]   I have a question about fasting on the longer term.
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:29.700]   And there it's a near infinite space we could explore of two days of fasting and one day.
[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:34.340]   I know people that every once in a while they just decide, I'm fasting.
[02:25:34.340 --> 02:25:38.260]   They've either been eating too much at parties or they're not feeling well
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:41.300]   or whatever, they just decide, I'm fasting for 24 hours.
[02:25:41.300 --> 02:25:45.220]   And they'll still consume water and caffeine, but they'll just fast.
[02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:47.540]   Is there any health benefit or detriment?
[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:50.580]   You mentioned the circadian clock shifting effects,
[02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:55.220]   but if somebody wakes up on Sunday and they ate too much
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:25:57.940]   or they feel they ate too much or they don't like the food they ate on Saturday,
[02:25:57.940 --> 02:26:00.820]   they're not really feeling it and they're just going to fast into Monday.
[02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:07.140]   Is there any known benefit or health detriment to doing that kind of thing?
[02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:11.460]   Yeah, there's actually a rich literature on this complete fast.
[02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:17.460]   And in fact, in many religion, people practiced complete fast as a way to
[02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:23.780]   cleanse their body and people have seen that there are benefits to that.
[02:26:23.780 --> 02:26:29.540]   So in fact, every other day eating in mouse model or even in humans,
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:34.340]   there are also initially some studies were done, there are many health benefits.
[02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:41.380]   And right now there are even fasting clinics in Germany where people check in
[02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:47.220]   and they're under strict supervision and then they do complete fast or maybe
[02:26:47.220 --> 02:26:52.980]   a small bowl of soup, which has 100, 200 kilocal, and that's all they get to eat.
[02:26:52.980 --> 02:26:58.820]   Sometimes two, three days, four days, five days, even they have gone up to three or four weeks.
[02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:01.220]   For sake of weight loss, is that why?
[02:27:01.220 --> 02:27:06.660]   For many different things and they come out pretty well healthy. Of course, they're under
[02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:15.700]   supervision, make sure that they're getting the micronutrients, vitamins and electrolytes.
[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:21.700]   So those studies are pretty solid. People have observed that. And then in fact,
[02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:27.620]   there are even idea that fasting, this kind of fasting can have huge impact on brain
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:32.020]   and people may come out of treatment resistant depression or something.
[02:27:32.020 --> 02:27:37.860]   So those studies are very difficult to do. There are only case of one here and there
[02:27:37.860 --> 02:27:45.220]   that we hear once in a while. But hopefully in future, we'll see whether the depression,
[02:27:45.220 --> 02:27:51.540]   anxiety, the mental health aspect will benefit from fasting. Because now as there is more and
[02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:58.260]   more evidence that there's this gut-brain axis and whether the presence of food or the microbiome
[02:27:58.260 --> 02:28:05.060]   changes in the gut, if they can affect brain, then maybe long-term fasting, periodic fasting,
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:11.620]   a few days of low calorie diet, back-to-back will be interesting to see how it impacts brain health.
[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:17.380]   Very interesting. What are your thoughts on fat fasting, where people try and limit their
[02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:25.780]   blood glucose by only eating mainly fats, mainly healthy. Typically they'll eat healthier fats of
[02:28:25.780 --> 02:28:34.580]   avocados, olive oils, and nuts, and some animal fats perhaps. But as a way to keep blood glucose
[02:28:34.580 --> 02:28:39.940]   low and also time restrict. This goes back to the kind of low carbohydrate thing. What are your
[02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:44.980]   thoughts on that as a general strategy for health? I mean, it combines sort of two general themes
[02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:50.260]   that are out there. I think both of which are data are still incoming, that restricting the
[02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:54.500]   feeding times, it can be beneficial as well as keeping overall blood glucose lower can be
[02:28:54.500 --> 02:29:02.980]   beneficial. Yeah, I think there is too much emphasis now on blood sugar spiking. We don't know
[02:29:02.980 --> 02:29:09.940]   this kind of eating pattern, for example. I mean, we are essentially telling pancreas that, okay,
[02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:19.300]   are the islet cells that produce insulin. It's okay, you can take a break, go on vacation for
[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:28.180]   a month or two or three months. My question is, it will be interesting to see what happens to
[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:36.980]   those islets. Because, for example, we know that if we disuse or unused our muscles, there's muscle
[02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:45.940]   atrophy. Muscles will become weaker. We don't know whether long-term consequences of this very low
[02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:52.900]   carbohydrate diet where you're not essentially engaging the islet cells periodically, what is
[02:29:52.900 --> 02:30:00.500]   its impact. So if there is no impact, maybe it's okay. Because, as you know, many people who
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:07.060]   actually work on ketogenic diet, the researchers themselves, they find it very difficult to stay
[02:30:07.060 --> 02:30:13.380]   in true ketogenic diet. Because the true ketogenic diet is consuming less than 10% of calories from
[02:30:13.380 --> 02:30:17.860]   carbohydrate. And not very many from protein. A lot of people think ketogenic diet allows them
[02:30:17.860 --> 02:30:22.100]   to eat massive amounts of meat, and that's not necessarily the case. Just one clarification for
[02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:27.700]   people, Sachin was referring to islet cells of the pancreas, which are the ones that manufacture
[02:30:27.700 --> 02:30:33.460]   insulin. So the question is whether or not taking in low levels of blood glucose by way of a low
[02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:37.700]   carbohydrate diet, those islet cells are going to shut off their production. Very interesting. I
[02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:43.860]   mean, the liver is a very plastic tissue. I mean, it tends to react very dramatically to lifestyle
[02:30:43.860 --> 02:30:47.460]   changes. Yeah. So that's why it will be interesting to see what happens. Means we know that even
[02:30:47.460 --> 02:30:53.700]   muscle disused, for example, people who become bedridden, they lose some muscle mass. But when
[02:30:53.700 --> 02:30:59.620]   they come back and exercise, they gain it back. So it'll be interesting to see what happens in
[02:30:59.620 --> 02:31:03.940]   these people who are going through long-term ketogenic diet. And of course, once in a while,
[02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:09.300]   because of social pressure or something else, if they don't have access to food or something
[02:31:09.300 --> 02:31:16.900]   happens, they may consume some sugar, some blood glucose will spike. But it's not that every spike
[02:31:16.900 --> 02:31:23.140]   is bad. I mean, the reason why we have insulin is for good reason. To buffer that spike.
[02:31:23.140 --> 02:31:28.180]   To buffer that spike and also, people always say that, well, if you have insulin produced or
[02:31:28.180 --> 02:31:33.140]   insulin-like growth factor, those are really bad and you should avoid that. And I think that's a
[02:31:33.140 --> 02:31:38.820]   little bit extreme. I mean, the insulin growth factor has evolved in muscle protein synthesis,
[02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:44.260]   tissue repair, maybe even cognition. Yeah. And it also goes back to,
[02:31:44.260 --> 02:31:51.860]   let's say, mTOR activation and all that stuff. People get really excited about how to reduce
[02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:58.260]   mTOR activation, rapamycin and all that stuff. So this is where, again, from circadian point of view,
[02:31:58.260 --> 02:32:08.980]   I ask people to think. So two very popular drug-like molecules or drugs that people think
[02:32:08.980 --> 02:32:16.420]   will increase longevity are metformin, which many people agree, not all will come to a consensus
[02:32:16.420 --> 02:32:24.100]   that it activates AMP kinase or the sensor in the cells that sense that your cells are fasting.
[02:32:24.100 --> 02:32:32.260]   So metformin activates it so that it, you can say, although it may not be scientifically accurate,
[02:32:32.260 --> 02:32:36.660]   the fasting in a pill. So it mimics fasting.
[02:32:36.660 --> 02:32:42.500]   And the thing I'd lump in there with metformin is that berberine is the poor man's metformin. It's a
[02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:46.180]   tree bark extract that also dramatically lowers blood glucose.
[02:32:46.180 --> 02:32:55.940]   Yeah. It mimics that fasting. And then rapamycin also reduces mTOR activation.
[02:32:55.940 --> 02:33:07.860]   People have shown that rapamycin and metformin can extend mouse lifespan and improve health.
[02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:15.300]   So now let's go back to the calorie restriction study that I mentioned. In calorie restriction,
[02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:20.260]   people are giving food as a lump sum, and they were essentially doing time restriction. The
[02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:25.300]   mice were doing time restriction. If we think about it, during daytime,
[02:33:25.300 --> 02:33:31.780]   when experimenters are coming to the bivariate, the mice should be sleeping and fasting.
[02:33:33.140 --> 02:33:40.020]   And they should naturally have high level of AMP kinase if they're truly fasting. And they should
[02:33:40.020 --> 02:33:46.980]   also have low level of mTOR activity because mTOR responds to insulin, and that should go off at
[02:33:46.980 --> 02:33:55.780]   night. So my suspicion is in many of these experiments where the mice were allowed to
[02:33:55.780 --> 02:34:04.180]   eat ad libitum, even normal standard chow, now we know that as mice get older, they actually
[02:34:04.180 --> 02:34:09.140]   consume a little bit more food during daytime. Which is the equivalent of human nighttime.
[02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:12.820]   Human's nighttime eating. It's like nighttime eating we know is an issue. I didn't realize
[02:34:12.820 --> 02:34:16.980]   that was more of an issue as people age, but- Yeah. So we don't know. But at least in mice,
[02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:22.180]   because we can put the mice in calorimetry, look at every single bite they're eating,
[02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:29.060]   how much they're eating. So I guess it was natural to see that researchers found that there is some
[02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:34.340]   mTOR activity during daytime when the mice were not supposed to have mTOR activity because they
[02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:40.900]   should be fasting. And since they ate a little bit, they were snacking during daytime, AMP kinase
[02:34:40.900 --> 02:34:51.700]   activity was not at its peak. So giving metformin kind of mimic their fasting state and reducing
[02:34:51.700 --> 02:34:57.620]   mTOR activity by drug like rapamycin also kind of mimic some aspect of the fasting state.
[02:34:57.620 --> 02:35:07.460]   So my suspicion is since these studies were done always in mice who are supposed to be in the
[02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:13.380]   fasting state and both mTOR, sorry, rapamycin and AMP kinase activator metformin kind of are
[02:35:13.380 --> 02:35:19.380]   mimicking that fasting state. That's why we have seen those benefits. And it'll be interesting to
[02:35:19.380 --> 02:35:25.620]   see if that experiment will be done in humans in long-term because many people are very excited
[02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:33.140]   about there is mTOR long-term metformin study. And then a lot of people are actually consuming
[02:35:33.140 --> 02:35:40.580]   good amount of rapamycin off-level. They can get their own. So that's my curiosity. I'm not saying
[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:43.940]   whether it's good or bad or whether there is science or not. That's something that will be
[02:35:43.940 --> 02:35:50.500]   interesting to control for and see. Because recently I saw one of my, again, close friend
[02:35:50.500 --> 02:35:56.980]   and colleague at Scripps, Katya Lamia, she did a very simple, elegant study people should have
[02:35:56.980 --> 02:36:03.460]   done in metformin field. She took mice and then measured their blood glucose at different time of
[02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:09.220]   the day. And in fact, just like human blood glucose, our blood glucose fluctuates a little
[02:36:09.220 --> 02:36:17.860]   bit. She saw that rhythm. And then in every two hours or three hours on different days, of course,
[02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:23.460]   she gave the same dose of metformin to mice. And what she found was at different time of the day,
[02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:33.060]   metformin had very dramatic change in glucose reducing ability. So which means that even if
[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:37.940]   you take metformin and give at different time of the day for the mouse or even for humans,
[02:36:38.660 --> 02:36:42.820]   in very long term, of course, in these mice, these mice were not diabetic or anything,
[02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:49.860]   they were healthy mice to begin with. So in long term, we might see benefits that are very
[02:36:49.860 --> 02:36:57.300]   different. So this brings to this idea that, well, maybe metformin, say at the end of the day,
[02:36:57.300 --> 02:37:03.540]   evening metformin may trigger that fasting state much earlier than end of digestion.
[02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:10.500]   Whereas metformin in the beginning of the day may not, at least from longevity perspective. I'm not
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:18.340]   talking about diabetes, type 2 diabetes here. So the same thing with mTOR. Is mTOR going to have
[02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:27.140]   much better impact if taken during evening, morning, before meal? So these are my thoughts
[02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:33.780]   that go along with all this fat story that we talked about. Do you take metformin or berberine?
[02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:40.580]   - No, I haven't taken, although, you know, I have close friend and colleague Ruben Shaw,
[02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:46.500]   who is now the director of cancer center at Salk. He extensively works on AMP kindness and
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:54.900]   its mechanisms. And so it's always fun to talk to him. - He's a fan. Yeah, I've taken berberine
[02:37:54.900 --> 02:38:01.060]   before and I've had two different, very distinct experiences with them. First of all, berberine,
[02:38:01.060 --> 02:38:05.780]   when ingested with carbohydrates, in particular carbohydrates that have a lot of simple sugars,
[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:09.700]   definitely, I know this because I measured my blood glucose, I did the experiment,
[02:38:09.700 --> 02:38:16.820]   allows you to flatten out your blood glucose response. So, you know, in some sense, if you're,
[02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:20.180]   you know, there is this idea, if you're going to eat a particularly big meal or sugary meal,
[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:23.780]   and you don't want to get a massive blood glucose rise, you take berberine or metformin.
[02:38:23.780 --> 02:38:28.020]   Metformin is prescription. That's why I went with berberine because it's, as far as I know,
[02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:31.460]   it works as well. - At least for healthy people.
[02:38:31.460 --> 02:38:38.820]   Yeah, for healthy people. That's right. When I took berberine and did not ingest
[02:38:38.820 --> 02:38:44.980]   large amounts of simple sugars or carbohydrates along with it, I experienced profound hypoglycemia.
[02:38:44.980 --> 02:38:49.140]   I felt like complete garbage for about eight hours. And I had one of the worst headaches
[02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:55.220]   of my life, which makes sense. You just got a blood sugar crash. So if you lower your blood
[02:38:55.220 --> 02:38:58.500]   sugar when you already have fairly low blood sugar and you're not ingesting carbohydrates,
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:03.860]   you can really bottom out your blood glucose. So just say it's, I say that for two reasons.
[02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:07.700]   One is kind of a cautionary note. And the other one that when you think about the biology of these
[02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:11.860]   compounds, it makes perfect sense. And I think that, and I did not pay attention to circadian
[02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:13.220]   effects. - Yeah. I mean,
[02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:24.340]   when I joined Salk, we know Ron Evans was the kind of the big leader in metabolism and he works on
[02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:29.380]   nuclear hormone receptors. These are the master regulator of metabolism in normal cells, cancer
[02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:35.940]   cells, and many other. And what was interesting was in the first few years, Ron did a very simple
[02:39:35.940 --> 02:39:42.340]   experiment. He just looked at what time of the day this nuclear hormone receptors are turned on
[02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:46.980]   at gene expression level and some at protein level. And he found that almost all of them
[02:39:48.180 --> 02:39:56.660]   have a circadian pattern, at least in some tissue. So he went to that length to say
[02:39:56.660 --> 02:40:03.940]   even that circadian is metabolism and metabolism is circadian. The reason why we have a circadian
[02:40:03.940 --> 02:40:12.740]   rhythm is to have a daily rhythms in food seeking behavior and eating and also go through a period
[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:19.700]   of time when we should be fasting. And then on the other hand, all the metabolic regulators
[02:40:19.700 --> 02:40:25.860]   also have to follow that rule and almost all metabolic regulators, everything that we can
[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:34.660]   think of connected to metabolizing, macronutrient, protein, carb, and fat, they should also have a
[02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:40.820]   circadian rhythm or diurnal cycle to align or misalign. So for example, fat oxidation should
[02:40:40.820 --> 02:40:49.380]   be in opposite phase with feeding. And in retrospect, at that time, it was kind of amazing
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:54.660]   to see Ron could foresee, of course, he's smart enough to foresee and predict that this is going
[02:40:54.660 --> 02:40:59.300]   to happen to circadian period. Because at that time we're thinking about the suprachiasmatic
[02:40:59.300 --> 02:41:04.820]   nucleus, sleep-wake cycle, and we are not thinking too much about metabolism. So that's the
[02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:13.540]   awesome thing about Salk, being at Salk because we have 50 PIs really crammed into two awesome
[02:41:13.540 --> 02:41:18.580]   buildings and with open lab structure. So you bump into each other and talk to yourself.
[02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:19.860]   And with an ocean view.
[02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:20.900]   With an ocean view.
[02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:25.780]   Yes. It's an amazing place. I was lucky enough to have an adjunct position there when my lab was at
[02:41:25.780 --> 02:41:32.580]   UCSD and it is an amazing place doing incredible groundbreaking work, which of course includes
[02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:41.940]   yours. Listen, Sachin, I'm clear now that we have to have you back on for another series of
[02:41:41.940 --> 02:41:47.860]   discussion, seriously speaking, if you'd be so kind and willing to do that. I want to thank you
[02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:51.780]   for several things. First of all, for your taking the time today to sit down and discuss
[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:56.820]   these incredibly interesting ideas in detail. Much of what we talk about on the podcast
[02:41:57.460 --> 02:42:04.100]   is obviously grounded in science and often, but not always as actionable. And so much of what we
[02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:10.740]   talked about today is actionable in the sense that many people are already doing certain dimensions
[02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:16.580]   of these things. Some are not, some are hearing about it and considering it. You've given dozens,
[02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:22.180]   I've listed some out, dozens of tools and considerations based on whether or not people
[02:42:22.180 --> 02:42:25.540]   are engaging in shift work or not. I think a lot of people are going to realize that they are shift
[02:42:25.540 --> 02:42:30.980]   workers, even though they didn't think they were because of the nature of their habits now to light
[02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:36.500]   and to activity and so forth. I absolutely love the firefighter study because of its relevance
[02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:41.460]   to the general population. Also another nod to fighter fighters and shift workers everywhere.
[02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:46.900]   Thank you. And I think among the colleagues I've known for several decades now,
[02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:54.340]   you really are one of a very small few who've managed to do both animal studies and human
[02:42:54.340 --> 02:43:00.420]   studies, but also animal studies with a very clear eye and a pointer toward human health.
[02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:07.060]   And that's such a vital and rare thing, especially in this day of extremely competitive funding.
[02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:10.100]   So I want to thank you for your time today, for the knowledge you share,
[02:43:10.100 --> 02:43:15.380]   the actionable aspects of that knowledge, the science that you're doing in your laboratory.
[02:43:15.380 --> 02:43:18.980]   We will provide links for people to learn more about you and of course, to go to the app
[02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:25.380]   so people can engage in some of the science directly. And of course you have several
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:29.060]   wonderful books now that we will also link to both of which I've read and are wonderful,
[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:34.500]   in particular the book, the first book, but also a book related to diabetes. And so for diabetics
[02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:41.780]   and people interested in metabolic and blood sugar regulation there. So on behalf of myself and my
[02:43:41.780 --> 02:43:46.100]   team here at the Huberman Lab podcast and all the listeners, I just want to say thank you so much.
[02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:50.660]   Your time is valuable and the fact that you share it with us and educate so many people
[02:43:50.660 --> 02:43:56.820]   is really a gift. Yeah, thank you. And actually, likewise, there are very few scientists who
[02:43:56.820 --> 02:44:03.060]   have taken this leadership role that you have taken to come and communicate science to the
[02:44:03.060 --> 02:44:10.900]   public. It's not easy because sometimes you have to distill it down to a simple soundbite
[02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:16.900]   to the point where the scientist and they'll say, "Oh, that may not be right." But we always have to
[02:44:16.900 --> 02:44:23.220]   keep in mind that we are always living in the dark is of science because the reason why I say that,
[02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:27.780]   this is not my quote actually, this is from one of my scientific hero Paul Schimmel from
[02:44:27.780 --> 02:44:35.860]   Scripps. He always says, "Think about it. 10 years ago, what you thought was right and the best
[02:44:35.860 --> 02:44:44.100]   has already changed." But one thing is the circadian rhythm and aligning it to our internal
[02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:50.820]   clock to our habit is very important. And as you mentioned, we have our MySecadianClock app,
[02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:56.980]   which is research facing, but we have also distilled all of this down to five or six
[02:44:56.980 --> 02:45:02.260]   timing component and we have a new app called OnTimeHealth or Get OnTimeHealth.
[02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:04.980]   Do people access that through the standard app stores?
[02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:15.140]   Yeah. So now it's available in Apple App Store and we want to see how, because people always
[02:45:15.140 --> 02:45:21.940]   think about fasting, but as we discussed today, feeding, fasting or eating, fasting and activity
[02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:28.500]   and sleep are kind of interlinked and we have to kind of balance both of these. So that was the
[02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:37.460]   idea behind this OnTimeHealth program. And thank you, Andy, because what you're doing is immensely
[02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:44.260]   necessary, particularly these days when science is moving at a very fast pace, there are a lot
[02:45:44.260 --> 02:45:50.020]   of results coming out. Sometimes something can be very confusing and you spending your time
[02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:55.380]   to communicate science is exceptional. So thank you, Andy.
[02:45:55.380 --> 02:46:01.620]   You're most welcome. It's days like today where I get to sit down and talk to brilliant colleagues
[02:46:01.620 --> 02:46:05.700]   like you who are doing the important work that really matters so much. And so as you
[02:46:05.700 --> 02:46:10.980]   mentioned a moment ago, there's a lot of darkness and confusion out there, but
[02:46:10.980 --> 02:46:15.380]   thank you for being one of those who's shining light.
[02:46:15.380 --> 02:46:17.400]   Thank you.
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:21.300]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr. Sachin Panda,
[02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:26.340]   all about circadian biology and time restricted feeding. If you're learning from and are enjoying

[02:46:49.940 --> 02:46:54.020]   comments. In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned at the beginning and throughout
[02:46:54.020 --> 02:46:58.740]   today's episode. That's the best way to support this podcast on various episodes of the Huberman
[02:46:58.740 --> 02:47:02.740]   Lab podcast. We discuss supplements while supplements aren't necessary for everybody.
[02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:06.100]   Many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like improving sleep,
[02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:11.300]   supporting hormones, improving focus, and so on. The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to have partnered
[02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:14.660]   with momentous supplements. We've done that for several reasons. First of all,
[02:47:14.660 --> 02:47:18.180]   momentous supplements are the very highest quality and are used
[02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:22.180]   with various sports teams and various studies through the Department of Defense and so on.
[02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:26.500]   And momentous supplements tend to be in single ingredient formulations.
[02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:30.260]   Single ingredient formulations are absolutely essential if you are going to develop the most
[02:47:30.260 --> 02:47:35.540]   cost-effective and biologically effective supplement regimen for you, because simply put,
[02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:39.700]   they allow you to adjust the dosage of individual ingredients to alternate days that you take
[02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:45.060]   different ingredients to cycle them and so forth. In addition, momentous supplements are available
[02:47:45.060 --> 02:47:49.140]   internationally, which many other supplements are not. If you'd like to see the supplements
[02:47:49.140 --> 02:47:53.060]   discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:47:53.060 --> 02:47:57.540]   livemomentous.com/huberman. If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:47:57.540 --> 02:48:03.620]   it's Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. And at all of those places,
[02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:07.380]   I cover science and science-based tools, some of which overlap with the contents of the Huberman
[02:48:07.380 --> 02:48:11.380]   Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:48:11.380 --> 02:48:15.300]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms. If you haven't already subscribed
[02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:18.980]   to the Huberman Lab podcast, neural network newsletter, it's a monthly newsletter that
[02:48:18.980 --> 02:48:24.420]   includes free toolkits for things like toolkit for sleep, how to enhance the quality and duration of
[02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:28.740]   your sleep, toolkit for focus, toolkit for neuroplasticity, toolkit for deliberate cold
[02:48:28.740 --> 02:48:33.060]   exposure, heat exposure, and summaries of podcast episodes. All of those toolkits can be found by
[02:48:33.060 --> 02:48:38.260]   going to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu, scroll down to newsletter, and simply give us your email.
[02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:42.100]   We do not share your email with anybody. And again, the newsletters and toolkits are completely
[02:48:42.100 --> 02:48:46.820]   zero cost, and you will also find some PDF examples of previous toolkits. Again, that's
[02:48:46.820 --> 02:48:52.340]   HubermanLab.com. Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion with Dr. Sachin Panda.
[02:48:52.340 --> 02:48:57.300]   I hope you found the conversation to be as informative and actionable as I did.
[02:48:57.300 --> 02:49:05.780]   And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
