[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   What do you think podcasts are for? Like what is happening?
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.960]   To anesthetize people.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   They want to feel they're learning something to put them to sleep so they can
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.560]   exercise and not feel like idiots occasionally to learn something.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.560]   It's to keep themselves busy work of some kind.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.760]   Is this to say more about the anesthetizing?
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.680]   You want to feel you're imbibing the most important ideas, right?
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.280]   And there's very costly, tough ways to do that.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.480]   Like to actually work on one of those problems as a researcher.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.280]   But most people can't do that through no fault of their own.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.240]   Even if they're academics, like maybe they just can't do it.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.280]   So like one of the next best things is to listen to someone who at least
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.880]   pretends that they've done it.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.080]   And it's like, okay, it's a substitute.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.000]   Like, why not?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.880]   What are you supposed to do?
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.920]   Watch TV.
