[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200]   That's good going.
[00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.840]   Lord, we're just so thankful for these moms and dads.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.800]   Thanks that they're joining us tonight.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.160]   And thanks that they're being consistent in coming to class
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.560]   and perfectly doing their homework.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.480]   Lord, we pray that tonight's session
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.600]   would be of benefit to them and a blessing to them as well.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.200]   We have a lot to cover tonight, Lord.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.000]   So please prepare our hearts and minds for the information
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.200]   that we're about to share, that it might glorify you.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.160]   Lord, we want to dedicate this class to you,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.680]   as we always do, in your son's precious name.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.320]   Amen.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.000]   Amen.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.800]   And before we get started, I just
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.520]   want to make a little announcement.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.360]   We have decided not to use January 2024 for the beta
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.440]   class.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.360]   So feel free to talk.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.880]   And don't hold back, because your videos
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.360]   won't be going anywhere.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.080]   All right?
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.880]   And you can put your jammies back on if you want.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.840]   And--
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.200]   Comfy as you want to be.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.680]   And as chatty as you want to be.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.600]   Absolutely.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.240]   And ask whatever questions you want to ask.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.920]   Feel free to do that.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.880]   We want to make sure that you guys get your time before this
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.440]   class comes to a close.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.480]   OK.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.400]   See how it goes then.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.680]   Anyway, we're on session 8, moving right along.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.120]   Ages 0 to 5, we're going to talk about methods.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.920]   The continuing concept is the erotic correction
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.200]   imparting wisdom.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.840]   You know, in the early years, it's not an easy thing
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.000]   to discipline, obviously.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.960]   And it's hard to even get our two-year-old's attention
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.360]   sometimes, as the chapter opens up and tells us that.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.960]   How effective can formative discipline
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.680]   be with an 18-month-old, a two-year-old, a five-year-old?
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.560]   And some of you may have experienced some frustration
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.440]   in those areas.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.600]   But even though your efforts are well-intended,
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.200]   and specifically, we're directed according to God's word
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080]   and we're being obedient, but sometimes we
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.080]   kind of feel like those words are just
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.520]   bouncing off the walls.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.000]   But again, our goal tonight is to kind of encourage you
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.480]   in all this and to let you know that your work is not--
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.200]   In vain.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.120]   In vain, yeah, for sure.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.520]   And that it will bear much fruit if you're patient
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.120]   and if you're consistent, right?
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.760]   One of the most important things that we have talked about
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.800]   before and we're going to emphasize again tonight
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.280]   is self-control leading towards more maturity.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.960]   That is such an important concept for us
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.920]   to be able to grasp and to understand
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.680]   and to relay that to our children
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.880]   because it will go well with them in all things
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.040]   if they do gain that understanding of what
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.640]   self-control is and meaning the ability
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.840]   to say no to yourself, right?
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.200]   And this is not merely a concept.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.560]   This is a biblical truth.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   It's a biblical discipline.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.800]   And we are called by God to practice self-discipline
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.640]   in several verses.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.520]   So even though you guys are absolutely
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.160]   submerged in a culture that is screaming
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.760]   that self-control is not fair and that little kids should not
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.480]   have to practice self-control because they're not
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.440]   developmentally ready, that is all false information.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.080]   I've been doing a lot of research lately on this,
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.440]   in fact, and you have to believe God's word.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.480]   He would not put it in there if it was not
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.120]   true, obviously.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.080]   And who knows better how to train up our little ones
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.600]   than God himself?
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.880]   So trust what he says and don't be
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.000]   afraid to require your children to practice self-control.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.440]   And of course, it's going to take practice.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.960]   It's going to take development.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.240]   It definitely is.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.240]   But that's your job is to train them developmentally
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.960]   to practice self-control.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.160]   And I just want to share a little something
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.800]   because I know we're going to hit on question number two
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.440]   where it talks about concentrated study in Proverbs
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.840]   and what are the three elements that characterize maturity.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.120]   And this was something that we literally
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.680]   used as a guideline for whether kids
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.040]   were going to be admitted into Cornerstone
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.080]   or whether they were going to spend a little more time
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.720]   at home practicing with mom and dad in these areas.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.960]   But when they came in, we would do--
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.760]   and these were sometimes four-year-olds
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.880]   that were getting ready to go into kindergarten at age five.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   And our questions that we presented to these little ones
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.920]   were very fun.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.520]   We had a lot of fun with them.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.640]   We gave them questions that were not threatening at all,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.560]   just super fun questions that they could answer.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.960]   We would get some incredible answers from them.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.720]   But they were based on digging in a little bit
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.160]   to find out these three important points.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.320]   Were they able to be self-controlled?
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.440]   Did they have biblical wisdom?
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.840]   Did they know why they were doing the things
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.040]   that they were doing?
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.880]   And were they showing signs of responsibility?
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.560]   And when we could check off all three of those boxes
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.360]   with our little four- and five-year-olds
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.840]   that were entering into Cornerstone, they would come in.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.240]   And there were a lot of kids that
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.440]   could because their parents were doing the same thing that you
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.760]   all are doing and practicing these techniques
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.840]   and the truths that go along with self-control.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.480]   So don't be swayed by your culture.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.280]   It is handing out lots of lies, which
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.200]   is leaving parents in terrible states of confusion and chaos
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.720]   in their homes.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.480]   So we just want to encourage you in that.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.680]   Yeah, and as Sharon said, it takes work.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.560]   And it takes us being diligent as parents of these children.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.760]   It doesn't naturally occur, does it?
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.960]   Maturity doesn't come all by itself.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.520]   No, we have to train it.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.480]   Absolutely.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.560]   And so we need to keep that close to our hearts
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.640]   and understand that it is our job to do that.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.920]   And it's a biblical mandate, so important.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.120]   Question number six, hopefully a good self-examination
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.680]   question.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.000]   Have you discovered certain areas
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.280]   your child is characterized by self-indulgence and immaturity?
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.920]   Again, I think it's really good to be
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.440]   able to take an inventory of where our kids are
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.280]   and by looking at their behavior and understanding, hey,
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.520]   what areas do I really need to focus on?
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.640]   What areas do I need to pay attention to
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.880]   and then to correct and train accordingly?
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.040]   So it's so important to be able to do that.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.560]   Hopefully you are doing that.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.840]   Another way to be able to do that
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.400]   is look at whether or not our kids are lobbying us.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:40.520]   Are they saying things like, please, mommy, please, daddy,
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.800]   after being told no by us to do or not do a certain thing?
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.360]   I think that's a good indicator.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.760]   So you want to be able to add that to your list as well.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.240]   Very important.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.120]   They may not even be saying, please.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.000]   They may just be saying, I don't want to.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.760]   I don't want to.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.560]   That's true.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.320]   Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.520]   No.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.760]   And that sure doesn't show submission, does it?
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.240]   Or it doesn't show respect or honor when they do that, right?
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.520]   So we want to be able to help them grow in maturity.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.800]   And I think our guideline, again,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.720]   is looking at Matthew 22, 37, 39, and Philippians 2, 3
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.320]   through 5.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.360]   Were they loving God?
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.720]   Were they loving their neighbor?
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.680]   Were they considering others better than themselves?
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.760]   Those are some great scriptures that really give us
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.840]   a good guideline on how we have to look at our children being
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.080]   able to grow up in maturity.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.080]   And it gives them a good guideline.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.400]   When they really learn to practice those principles,
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.960]   they start to define it themselves.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.560]   And they know when they're not doing something that
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.520]   falls within the guidelines of being
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.080]   self-controlled and respectful to the people around them.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.280]   Question number nine gives us some insight
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.560]   into what the Lord says about this in Ephesians 4, 2, and 3.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.440]   It says to be completely humble and gentle.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.560]   Be patient.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.240]   Bearing with one another in love.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.040]   Make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   through the bond of peace.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.440]   And certainly, a child that lacks self-control
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.640]   is not going to be able to conduct his behavior
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.480]   accordingly, right?
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.000]   So again, some good things to look at and to think about.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.480]   Any questions?
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.040]   I know we're sweeping through this pretty quickly.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.920]   And it's an important topic.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.520]   Anybody have any questions specifically about this?
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.960]   I have a question about self-indulgence.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.160]   I guess in terms of always wanting to be first.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.680]   So the older one will tell, well, the first will be last.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.400]   But then the younger one always runs in front of her
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.440]   to get to the door first.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.360]   And so the older one will back up to not get bulldozed.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.240]   OK, good.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.440]   I'm glad to hear that your older one is
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.160]   picking up on the principles.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.640]   And yeah, so at least you're not training both of them, right?
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.280]   Yeah, but I kind of feel bad because one of them
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.840]   always is first.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.560]   Right.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.280]   So and then sometimes we're like, then we do every other.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.280]   Like, OK, well, this time he went through first.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.680]   So next time you get to go through first.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.280]   And I'm like, but there's three of you.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.680]   So you're not always--
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.000]   I'm not going to remember the order every time.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.040]   Exactly.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.480]   Yeah, and because when they start doing that
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.840]   and they start questioning, no, I went first.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.720]   It's my turn.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.600]   You went first last time.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.240]   They are literally falling right back into that.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.480]   Yeah, self-indulgence, that thinking of themselves first,
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.120]   prioritizing themselves.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.960]   And I mean, at that point, even that saying
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.760]   can be twisted in so many ways.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.600]   And we've heard kids do that in so many ways
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.280]   where they'll convince another sibling
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.760]   to go to the end of the line because the last will be first.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.680]   So it can really backfire if they don't get
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.200]   the principle in their heart that this
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.720]   is an exercise of dying to self, of sacrificing self,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.960]   and that there's joy in sacrificing themselves.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:38.280]   So I mean, if my kids were doing that
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.160]   and we had lots of that going on at Cornerstone
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.200]   where we would have to train the kid,
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.160]   pretty soon there'd be a fight for who's going first
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.680]   and start who's going first.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.160]   And then it would be the fight for who's going last.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.080]   So like I said, they can twist this in so many ways
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.920]   and still come out thinking only of themselves.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   For sure.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.560]   And so with my kids, there would be discipline sometimes
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.280]   if they were not getting through with it,
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.720]   if it was not getting through to them.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.840]   Because at some point, they're not listening.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.480]   At some point, they are taking what they're learning
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.120]   and using it for their own benefit.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.480]   And at that point, there is an attitude of rebellion
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.720]   or disobedience in that.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.160]   And so discipline is an appropriate response
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.840]   to that for your child, remembering
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.640]   all the rules of discipline.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.120]   And maybe in the beginning, it's not physical discipline.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.360]   Maybe you're going to apply a related consequence.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.920]   And then after a couple of days, if it's still
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.880]   not getting through to them, and it probably won't.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.800]   Because really, there's one discipline
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.000]   that gets to the heart.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   And that is the consequence, the chastisement
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.800]   when they're little.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.680]   And so you will probably have to apply the chastisement.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.040]   And so it sounds like your oldest is doing a good job.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:11.240]   Sounds like your youngest is taking advantage of that,
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.800]   or however it's working over there.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.560]   And so maybe somebody is going to have
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.480]   to start to suffer the consequences.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.240]   And the other one's going to get some pats on the back.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.920]   It just depends on what's happening and who's doing what.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.240]   So does that make sense?
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.640]   Yeah, I think-- yeah, I think it's
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.040]   hard to know if the person is just stepping back
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.240]   because of not wanting to get bulldozed versus--
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.040]   I think I appreciate your reminder
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.160]   that it's about self-sacrifice.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.920]   So I think that's important to remember
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.320]   that at the end of the day, it's about the heart.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.720]   Yeah, sacrifice.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.840]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.000]   So that is something you could talk to your kids about
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.040]   and remind them as well.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.520]   And so if they're acting outside of that,
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:13.640]   then they're probably in sin, practicing selfishness.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.640]   Did you ever do a rule of if you don't do your chores,
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.600]   you can't eat?
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.440]   Because those who don't work can't eat?
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.200]   No, there were certain things.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.600]   It's interesting because I've heard
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.640]   all the different kinds of applications
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.080]   straight from the Bible.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.880]   In fact, in the book that we recommend,
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:42.240]   Instructions in Righteousness, there are great ideas in there.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.600]   She can really give a lot of good information.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.720]   But there are several things in there that as a mom,
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.120]   I wasn't going to apply.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.520]   So any time the consequence ended up
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:01.560]   taking away something that is what I considered a need,
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.080]   no, I would not do that.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.280]   I would find a different consequence
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.680]   and stick more with what is a privilege.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.480]   So--
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.800]   OK, makes sense.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.120]   Yeah, I mean, if it's that severe
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:21.240]   that you would want to remove the privilege of food
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:27.960]   from them, I would say you're better off applying a spanking.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.120]   Get it done and get it over with and give your child
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.440]   the chance to succeed, right?
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.760]   Sometimes we hold off.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.680]   We don't want to give the chastisement.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.840]   And the chastisement is the one thing that's going to work.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.720]   And not that we want that to be the answer to everything,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.800]   but if you're not seeing the fruit that you should be seeing
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.160]   if they're not getting the lesson,
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.280]   that means that they're rejecting the lesson.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.720]   They are capable of it, but they're not doing it.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:07.120]   And so that's them making a decision to hear you,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.200]   but to not respond.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.040]   OK.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.640]   Yeah, we've never not given them food in the end.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.840]   It's just like, well, we all work together in order.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.560]   And food is-- we'll say it like that.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.240]   We've never once not given them food,
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.040]   but it's enough to kind of sometimes
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.400]   motivate some of them who care about eating.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.200]   I mean, I might do something where
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.600]   they are the ones that serve the food,
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.920]   and they are the ones that clean up after.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.640]   That'd be better.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.840]   Those kinds of things.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.960]   And that way, they are getting in the service
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.480]   that they should be doing.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.920]   So there's things like that where
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.800]   I wouldn't go directly at not giving them food,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.040]   but then find that consequence somewhere around there.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.160]   OK, got it.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.600]   Thank you.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.760]   Sarah's got a question.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.400]   Was that a book that you just recommended?
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.480]   Yes.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.520]   What was it again?
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.440]   For Instructions in Righteousness,
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.000]   and it's from Doorpost Ministries.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.360]   You can buy it on Amazon, but I would just
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.560]   go straight to Doorpost.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.240]   They'll get it out to you.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.240]   And I know it seems like all the good Christian books
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.400]   are starting to sell for more and more on Amazon.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.400]   So it's not really worth it.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.720]   And better for the ministry person
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.880]   to be making the money than Amazon making the money.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.720]   Anyway, yeah, Doorpost is the one
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.160]   that has all the charts that we recommend.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.000]   The If/Then chart and the Blessing chart,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.760]   they're so good.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.960]   Go to the ant.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.360]   That's one if somebody is being a sluggard.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.640]   And it's a whole lesson on going to the ant
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.040]   and seeing how God has created the ant to be a worker.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.960]   And then there's also really good lessons
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.560]   for boys and for girls.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.320]   And I love that ministry.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.200]   They have been doing a phenomenal job
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.000]   ever since my kids were little.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.400]   And they're still going strong.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.440]   And her biggest book is For Instructions in Righteousness.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.960]   And it's literally like a Bible study on behaviors.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.360]   So she's gone through.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.960]   And then she's taken it from the If/Then.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.240]   So if your child has done this, then this
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.040]   would be either the consequence or this would be the blessing.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.560]   And she covers all of that information.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.640]   I can't tell you how many times I referenced that book when
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.160]   my kids were growing up, when I was not
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.760]   able to come up with the correct thing at the correct moment.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.280]   And I would run to that book and open it up
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.640]   and get a great idea on how to do a consequence.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.520]   Although, like I said, be careful
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.600]   that you're not taking any needs or being too harsh on it.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.320]   Find a good consequence.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   And if it is something that is like don't give them a meal,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.040]   something like that where I just I don't agree with that,
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.800]   but then think, OK, what's surrounding the meal
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.880]   that I can use as a consequence?
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.840]   And so like in this situation that we just had,
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.000]   I referenced being the one who serves the family
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.320]   or being the one who clears the plates
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.360]   and maybe even does the dishes, those kinds of things.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.120]   So you can switch things out for what she recommends.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:50.600]   If it's something that feels out of sorts to you and be wise.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.720]   You guys have the Holy Spirit, be wise.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.400]   Be discerning.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:02.680]   Yeah, she was a tougher disciplinarian than I ever was.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:08.880]   I really love the gospel, just remembering the gospel,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.560]   remembering compassion, remembering
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.480]   what the purpose of discipline is.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.280]   It is to get them to improve for the better,
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.840]   to get them to overcome their sin.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.360]   It's not punishment.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.640]   And so if we keep all those things in mind,
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.800]   then we can pick out the really good suggestions.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.440]   And there are a lot of them in there.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:42.240]   And leave the ones that aren't quite so merciful.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.040]   Yeah, use your mommy and daddy to serve.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.400]   Yes, definitely.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.760]   OK, any other questions on day one?
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.840]   And I have to tell you, I feel a little bit the same
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.320]   with Red Bradley, too.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.720]   That's a book I would never recommend on its own.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.240]   I recommend it to go along with Ted Tripp
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.600]   because Ted Tripp is so good at teaching
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.240]   gospel-driven parenting.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.320]   He sure is.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.600]   That it balances out that kind of bullet point style
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.920]   that Red Bradley has.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.680]   So I love what Red Bradley says, but I
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.080]   like getting context, which is why we do that along
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.040]   with shepherding a child's heart.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.920]   Yeah, and I think in later revisions,
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.640]   he also came to the belief that he was--
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.040]   He recognized that he was being authoritarian.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.880]   Authoritarian.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.200]   He even had some broken relationships
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.600]   with a couple of his boys, but they restored.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.680]   And he wrote his final chapter in Child Training Tips
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.720]   that you guys will read on loving God
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.840]   and loving your neighbor.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:53.840]   That was written after all of his moments of humility
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.200]   and learning.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.920]   And repenting.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.320]   Yes, and repenting.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.040]   So yeah, which is another reason why I like Red Bradley.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.280]   Yep, OK, I'm going to go to day two.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.280]   Yeah, ready, set, go.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   This session is entitled Self-Control, Focusing
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.120]   and Paying Attention.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.320]   There's two aspects that we need to consider
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.600]   when we talk about focusing and paying attention.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.360]   The first is the ability to focus and pay attention
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.680]   is a moral skill.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.480]   Focusing and paying attention need
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.120]   to be trained into our children by dad and mom.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   And if you don't train them, then it's
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.760]   not going to be their fault if they run away from you
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.880]   when you give them an instruction because you haven't
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.160]   trained them to focus, to hear your mommy voice and daddy
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.480]   voice, and pay attention to it.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.120]   So it is a moral skill, and we need
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.040]   to train that into our children and give a consequence.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.160]   Because for disobedience in the area of moral skills,
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.560]   there is a consequence.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.720]   The second is the ability to focus and pay attention
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.640]   will foster your child's ability to learn.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.040]   And I think you can testify to that
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.480]   in terms of not only our family, but also Cornerstone.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.600]   Yeah, I mean, we had no failing students at Cornerstone,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.960]   and that was not an accident.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.920]   That was not a fluke that we just
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.800]   happened to get bright children.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.080]   We had children of all different capabilities.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:34.000]   We strived for a high standard in the classroom.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.320]   We believed that you teach to the highest standard
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.800]   and not sabotage the high-end learners
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.440]   because the others can't keep up.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.920]   We taught to a high standard, and then it
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.560]   was up to mom and dad at home if some of their kids
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.600]   were struggling to work with them on their own.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.400]   Of course, we came alongside any of them that needed it.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.320]   But just because of the fact that these kids
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.840]   were able to be self-controlled and respectful
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.200]   to the people around them, respectful to their teachers,
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.680]   the classrooms were a dream.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.080]   It was fun.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.960]   It was energetic.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.400]   The teachers had a great time with these kids,
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.960]   and these kids learned like crazy.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.120]   And I am completely convinced that it's
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.720]   because we had focused on the moral skills,
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.520]   and these kids were able to be learners.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.040]   And that's the advantage.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.120]   That's what we get when we do what God tells us to do.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.480]   So our kids benefit.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.440]   They do, absolutely.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.200]   In a big way.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:47.880]   Yep.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.320]   And those around them benefit.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.360]   Let's go and do some exercises.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.000]   Hopefully, you had your Bibles ready
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.800]   when you were doing your homework this past week
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.240]   and are going to be able to help us out with some answers
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.600]   to some of these questions.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.400]   Get ready.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.120]   Here we go.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.520]   We're going to look at the who, the what, the why,
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.520]   and how of focusing and paying attention
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.560]   from the Lord's perspective, right?
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.760]   This is a great exercise, and hopefully, you've done it.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.240]   Who wants to give us the first one?
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.040]   Question number 11.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.960]   Exodus 15, 26.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.160]   To whom should your child pay attention?
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.520]   Camera's on, everybody.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.800]   Please.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.480]   Unless you are God, you can't.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.720]   Good, I heard the Lord God.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.560]   Is that correct?
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.720]   OK.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.800]   About Mark 9, 7.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.360]   Beloved son, listen to him.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.440]   Yep, Jesus, absolutely.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.400]   Proverbs 1, 8.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.920]   Father and mother.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.680]   Perfect.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:52.560]   Deuteronomy 18, 19.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.240]   Prophets.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.720]   God's words through the prophet.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.040]   And in this case, obviously, in this day and age,
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.400]   Bible teachers, instructors, yeah.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.920]   Those that teach the word.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.760]   Yep.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.560]   And Romans 13, 1.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.080]   Governing authorities.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.240]   Governing authorities, absolutely.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.360]   Render unto Caesar those things that are Caesar's, right?
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.320]   And we need to also consider the people
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.120]   that we leave our children with, either in children's church,
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.680]   pre-K teachers, grandma and grandpa.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.920]   So hopefully, you're able to, at least to some extent,
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.800]   share with them the standards and look
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.640]   for those individuals that share the same kind of standards
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.400]   that you do.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.120]   And you want to verbally encourage your child
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.640]   to pay attention and to listen to these people
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.000]   the same way they would listen to mom and dad.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.440]   So important to do that and then to get that feedback
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.800]   from those individuals.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.320]   Right.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.520]   And if they have been disrespectful to them,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:58.200]   we have to be faithful to give a consequence so that that won't
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.400]   happen time and time again.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.440]   And of course, they may test a few times,
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.760]   but that's all it will take.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:11.120]   And your children will choose to be very respectful
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.240]   to the people around them, and they
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.760]   become an incredible blessing to the people that are with them
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.760]   and are able to be blessed by others.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.120]   So it's really a good deal.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.320]   It's a really good deal.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.520]   Let's go to number 12, the what.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.120]   The definition for focus is the concentration of attention
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.040]   or energy on something.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.000]   So hopefully, you've looked up the scriptures
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.880]   that are applicable to discover what your child will gain
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.200]   by learning to concentrate his attention on authorities
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.240]   who will guide, train, and love them.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.640]   Who has Proverbs 4.1?
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.760]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.760]   Insight.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   Proverbs 4.1?
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.480]   To have understanding?
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.720]   Yep, understanding.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.640]   Proverbs 4.20 through 22?
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.000]   Life and health.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.720]   Yep.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.880]   Proverbs 5.1 and 2?
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.360]   Discretion.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.360]   Discretion and knowledge, good.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.680]   Proverbs 22.17 through 19?
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:25.400]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.720]   Trust in the Lord.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.080]   Trust in the Lord, yeah, good, very good.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.320]   How about number 13, the why?
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.840]   Look up the following scriptures,
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.760]   write out why it is imperative that your child learns
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.440]   to focus.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.440]   Now, some of these may be positive
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.200]   and some may be negative.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:48.880]   How about Exodus 15.26?
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.720]   Tom, you're welcome to join us if you want.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.440]   To stay within God's circle of blessing?
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:06.600]   Exodus 15.26?
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.000]   I didn't see who said that.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:10.720]   Was that Dan?
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:19.480]   Yeah, I think we maybe got it wrong, but--
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.000]   OK, no problem.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.560]   Well, you're probably looking at it in that way, and you could.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.600]   The answer is the diseases brought upon the Egyptians
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.480]   will not be brought upon us.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.840]   And so technically, Exodus 15.26 is telling us
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.600]   that we suffer consequences for our disobedience.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.480]   And there are times that God will
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.840]   use illness or disease in our life
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.160]   as a way of getting our attention
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:55.680]   and getting us to repent and humble ourselves before him.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.200]   And that was an example of that.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.360]   I think we were just looking at the blessing side of it.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.320]   Yeah, well, and that's true.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.600]   That's true.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.440]   I mean, it is.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.960]   When you're in the circle of blessing,
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.240]   you would not receive that, those diseases.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.360]   I mean, you might.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.520]   I'm not saying you're not going to get sick ever in your life,
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.840]   obviously.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.520]   But sometimes our illnesses are just an opportunity
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.680]   that God is using to draw our attention back to him
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:36.160]   and to get us to recognize some sin in our life
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.320]   that needs to be repented of.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.360]   OK.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.040]   How about Exodus 23.21 through 22?
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:48.840]   He will be an enemy to our enemies.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.920]   Yes, oppose those who oppose us.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.920]   Yes.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:59.680]   Deuteronomy 7.12 and 13.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.680]   He will love, bless, and multiply.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.840]   Yep, increase your numbers.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.480]   Absolutely.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:10.200]   Isaiah 48.18.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.160]   I love this one.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.880]   Oh, I was going to say that.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.480]   Peace and righteousness.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.400]   Peace.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.480]   Peace like a river.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.640]   Yeah, it's peace like a river.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.160]   Absolutely.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.280]   Peace and righteousness.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.120]   Hebrews 12.1.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.360]   I'm sorry, Hebrews 2.1.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:34.280]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.040]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.560]   Yeah, good job, guys.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.600]   And then Proverbs 19.20.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.720]   Gain wisdom.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.800]   You will have wisdom, yes.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.120]   Good for you guys.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:47.640]   Good deal.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.240]   Good job.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.720]   Isn't that amazing when you go through all of those scriptures
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:57.600]   and find out all of the ways, the whys, the what, the hows.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.440]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.080]   God takes this seriously.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.440]   Let's finish up with the hows.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.240]   Number 14.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.920]   How do you know when your child is paying attention to you?
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.760]   The following scriptures highlight wisdom
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.720]   from both Ezekiel and David.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.600]   So Ezekiel 40.4.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.520]   40 verse 4.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:21.000]   I've got look carefully and listen closely.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.680]   Yep.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.400]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:23.920]   Perfect.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.240]   Look with your eyes and hear with your ears.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:33.760]   And then Psalm 141.8.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.480]   Eyes are towards us.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.480]   Yes, fix your eyes on the Lord.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.360]   Exactly.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.200]   That's so good.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.440]   And that's important that we train our kids to do that
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.000]   as well.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   So when you're talking to your child
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.400]   and giving them an instruction, make sure
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.720]   that their eyes are fixed on you.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.200]   It's a pretty good indication that you have their attention.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.800]   So again--
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.640]   Usually what I would even say to my kids
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.800]   when I had an instruction for them,
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:03.360]   I would actually start off by saying, eyes on mom.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.960]   And they would stop, and they would look at me.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.640]   And then I knew I had their attention.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.000]   And then I would give them whatever instruction
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.800]   they needed.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.160]   Yep.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.920]   And question number 15.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.440]   What does the Bible say about self-control?
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.280]   Proverbs 25.28.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.600]   Yeah, this is important.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:30.360]   Then, now, and always.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.200]   Or then, always, and now.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.400]   Then, now, and always.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:35.880]   Yep.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:41.160]   Proverbs 25.28.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.040]   A man without self-control is like a city broken into
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.840]   left without walls.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.280]   Yeah, and if you think about the walls
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.480]   that they were talking about, they
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.240]   built their walls so thick that homes
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.520]   were built within those walls.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.680]   And chariots could be driven on the top of the walls.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.960]   And they were huge.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:11.200]   And God is making a big example out of the protection
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.880]   that those cities had by saying, a man without self-control
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.560]   is like a city whose walls are broken into, right?
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.040]   In those days, that meant that anybody could come in
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.760]   and destroy them.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.560]   And destroy them.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.440]   Yep.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.280]   And lastly, but just as important, Galatians 5.22
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.400]   through 23.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.360]   We know that self-control is what?
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.760]   It's a fruit of the spirit, right?
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.480]   So good.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.520]   So hopefully, you had a good opportunity
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.160]   to go through those and meditate on those scriptures
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.800]   and apply them.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.520]   We have a question.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.560]   Dan, your hand's up.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:53.000]   Well, I was just going to say, we recently
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.040]   got a book from Kofi and Christy Hinn.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.920]   Nice, yes.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   If you guys haven't seen this one, it's really good.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.400]   Yeah, it's really good.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.520]   Yeah, we try and read as many children's books as we can.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   I haven't read that one.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.640]   I actually do.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.400]   We recommend it.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.960]   Good, that's awesome.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.360]   Yeah, they've got a couple of them out now.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.800]   And I'm hoping that they're going
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.880]   to continue to put more and more out,
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:24.760]   because I know the topics will be perfect for kids.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.760]   It'll be good lessons.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.600]   In fact, Kosti's coming to our church in October
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.160]   to do the men's conference.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.400]   So we're excited to invite him there
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.480]   and to see him at that time.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.280]   OK, any questions on day two?
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.160]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.640]   Okey-dokey.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.720]   Let's do some practical.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.200]   Let's go to day three.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.120]   We talked about eye contact.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.840]   Is there anything you want to add on that?
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.920]   I mean, it's super important.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.240]   It's really, really a good part of that.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.960]   Remember, we talked about the yes, mom, yes, dad,
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.000]   and that that is like a little verbal contract.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.120]   The eye contact is as important, because a lot of times,
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.960]   they will get into the habit of yes, mom, yes, dad.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.640]   And kind of mumble it while they're still on the video game
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.560]   or whatever it is they're doing.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.040]   And you still don't know whether they actually
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.920]   heard the instruction.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:24.040]   But if you get them to look you in the eye
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:28.560]   and then hear the instruction, and even if they're little,
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.160]   you can have them repeat the instruction back to you.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.320]   What did mama tell you to do?
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.600]   You told me that I need to go put my clothes in the drawer
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.880]   and make my bed.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.200]   And then I would say, OK.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.000]   And I would say, what do you say?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Because I had interrupted.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.360]   They would say yes, mom, and off they would go.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.480]   So it's really good when all of these start to work together,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:00.240]   because you're really getting a hold of their brain
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.400]   in that moment.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:06.560]   And a lot of times, you're in the kitchen doing something.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.000]   And instead of shouting an instruction out,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.520]   ask your child to come to you.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.240]   Come see mama or daddy.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.600]   And when they come in, then you give them--
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.520]   and they should say yes, mom, yes, dad
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.680]   when you call them to you.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.600]   And then when they get there, you give them their instruction.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.240]   And they should say yes, mom, yes, dad.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.080]   But make sure their eyes are on you
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.200]   and they're listening to you.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.960]   Remember the ears and the eyes.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.880]   And when you're starting with the little ones,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.920]   it's human good to maybe pull their little faces
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.240]   and position their hands so they're looking at you.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.680]   And don't be surprised if you get
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.240]   the ones that will refuse to turn their eyes to you.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.600]   The face might be towards you, but their eyes
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.120]   are going to be off to the side.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.960]   And that is a little form of owning
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.040]   their will in that moment.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.320]   They don't really want to hear what you have to say.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.600]   They really want to do what they want to do.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.480]   They don't want to submit to you.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.800]   And so it is actually an act of rebellion.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.440]   I wouldn't spank right away for that.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.960]   But I would work with them to get their eyes on you
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.800]   so that they become comfortable with that.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.880]   And eventually, if they keep refusing to do it,
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.880]   then it might be a physical consequence.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.000]   But hopefully, it won't get there.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.040]   Hopefully, you can train them to get their eyes on you
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.640]   and help them to know you're serious about that.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.040]   And these are all the little things
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.960]   that are going to eliminate that chaos and confusion
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.320]   in your home.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.120]   It's going to clarify things.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.560]   And your kids are going to know what you expect.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.200]   And you're going to know that they know what you expect.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.080]   And that just gives you peace.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.040]   And there's unity in that.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.040]   So--
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.160]   We have a couple of questions.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.000]   Jenna.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.640]   I'm on the lines of having them look you in the eye.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.560]   Do you have them kind of stand up
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.960]   at more like an attention kind of stance as opposed
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.640]   to like kind of around?
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:21.160]   I mean, only if I would have been having trouble with them,
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.960]   then maybe I might do that.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:29.000]   I don't remember having to do that necessarily with the kids.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.840]   We started this pretty young with them.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.920]   So they kind of knew what the system was.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.440]   And so I would have them come.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.160]   And they would be standing when they would come to me.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.120]   But if I was in the same room with them,
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.840]   and they were sitting down reading a book
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.320]   or playing with toys or something,
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.720]   and I would say, eyes on mom.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.560]   And they would turn.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.080]   And they would look at me.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.200]   And then they would listen to the instruction.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.680]   They would put their toy down.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.200]   And then they would go do it.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.920]   And that was fine.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:07.520]   I didn't need them to be standing up and doing all that.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.120]   It's OK if they're relaxed.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.720]   What about when you're having more of like a conversation
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.240]   around like behavior?
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.360]   Like you've given a consequence, talking to them about why
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.840]   they got the consequence?
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.360]   OK, so you're talking about the restoration process
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.720]   after the consequence?
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:36.080]   Again, I mean, if the child was still acting out,
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:41.640]   I might have them stand in front of me and look me in the eyes.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.080]   No matter what, they needed to look me in the eyes.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.840]   Every time we talked, that was, I would say,
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.560]   I want your eyes if they weren't looking at me.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.800]   I would say, I want your eyes.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:57.160]   But I mean, there were many, many times
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.360]   that I could go in after a consequence.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.520]   And they would be either sitting or lying on their bed.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.040]   And I could go sit with them on their bed.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.120]   And they would look at me.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.280]   We would talk.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.680]   It was a sweet time.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.560]   And it was relaxed.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.440]   But that was because their heart was humbled, right?
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.840]   So if I had that moment where one of them
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:28.000]   gave them a spanking and the heart wasn't humbled,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.120]   that wouldn't be me trying to get them to stand up and look
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:32.880]   me in the eyes.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.480]   I wouldn't be fighting for that.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.960]   I would just go in and give them another spanking.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.360]   And then, right, two, no more.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.600]   But usually, that's because that would
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.240]   mean that their little hearts are not humbled at that point.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.120]   So that would be--
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.000]   That makes sense.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.120]   OK.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.040]   Thank you.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.000]   OK, next question.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.760]   Deb, hi there.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.880]   Yeah, so you had said that you, when
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.880]   you were giving the original example about you'd
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.320]   be working with a kid on making eye contact instead of just
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.720]   going straight to spanking.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.720]   Yes.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.920]   So two questions wrapped into one
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.520]   is, part one, how much--
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.720]   we have slightly older kids to be starting this with,
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.400]   so a smart four-year-old and an eight-year-old.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.040]   How much of a runway would you have
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.320]   before you started spanking?
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.800]   And then question two that's wrapped up with it
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.520]   is that my eight-year-old has a hard time looking at anything
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.600]   for an extended period.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.880]   Like, you ask her to smile at her camera,
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.080]   and she doesn't really know how to just look and keep
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:33.960]   her eyes focused.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.440]   And skill versus will, we're not exactly sure.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.960]   It could be both.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.840]   So how much consideration would you give that?
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.000]   Or would you consider this a great chance to practice it?
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:51.520]   First of all, I would probably say that it is skill and will.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.440]   It hasn't been trained.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:43:01.000]   And so she is--
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.880]   sorry-- she is resisting you.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.520]   She has been able to do that in the past.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.680]   You've never required that she look at you.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.160]   It's brand new, right?
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.760]   And so you're going to be breaking some habits with her.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.840]   So on both of your questions, with a four-year-old
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.320]   and an eight-year-old, they're both
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:27.480]   very capable of knowing what you're saying to them
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.560]   and learning and showing self-control.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:35.240]   Obviously, the eight-year-old should be far quicker at it
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.160]   than the four-year-old.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.720]   But the way it usually goes, the younger one usually
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.520]   does it more quickly than the older one,
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.600]   because the older one has been free to practice
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:53.880]   her rebellious little actions for eight years now.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.600]   And sometimes that's very hard to break.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.200]   So you might end up having to work with her longer.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.480]   So sorry, quick answer.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.600]   I would do two days of habit-breaking.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:11.400]   So where you're just saying, OK, now your eyes were not on me.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:16.960]   I understand this is not your habit to have your eyes on me.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.360]   But we're only going to do two days of warnings,
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.560]   just because I want to help you to break that habit.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:30.840]   But after that, then it is going to be chastisement thinking.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.360]   Because this is not going to go away
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.480]   until you understand that mom is serious about this.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.280]   Makes sense.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.440]   It's important, and I want you to learn it.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.000]   It's going to benefit you.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.520]   So try that and let us know how it works.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.360]   Will do.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.160]   OK, good, good deal.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.880]   OK, let's talk about story time.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.440]   Give us some good, quick, practical steps
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:03.600]   about how we should conduct mom or dad-directed story time.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   I get in trouble.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.360]   No, no.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.360]   It's OK.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.480]   All right, so story time is super important.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.960]   We are in terrible habits as moms and dads with story time.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   And we allow so much of the kids controlling us
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:27.080]   that story time is chaos.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.840]   And unfortunately, that does not do the child any good.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.400]   Story time is the most wonderful, sweet time
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.720]   to have with your child.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:41.640]   And it's an opportunity to help them practice self-control.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.000]   This is where we are preparing them
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.760]   to become those learners for life.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:53.680]   So what I recommend is at least two story times per day.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.160]   It can be very short, very short, as short as you want it.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.000]   One is at night, where you guys can cuddle.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.040]   You can be in bed with them and have them on your lap
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.480]   or whatever and be reading a story,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.560]   however you like to do story time.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.880]   I used to love to do that with my kids
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.480]   or when they were little in the rocking chair, loved that.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.160]   And that's where I can hold the book in front of them
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.920]   and I can read the book as they're
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.560]   looking at the pictures.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:27.480]   I was still in control of the story, not them.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.840]   And that was just something that they learned as we went.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.080]   And so I would read one or two, a couple of pages,
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.200]   little pictures on the page.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.760]   And then I would stop before turning the page
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.840]   and I would ask them to tell me about the pictures.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:47.160]   So now they get to engage with the pictures
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.000]   because that's really all they want to do, right?
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.400]   But you also want them to hear the story, hear the words,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.320]   hear the reading.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.640]   It's all a process of learning.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.800]   The second kind of reading time that you're going to do,
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   you're going to actually have them either sitting
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.320]   in a little chair where their feet can be on the floor
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:12.560]   or sitting crisscross applesauce with their hands in their lap.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:16.840]   And you're going to practice really good, almost school time
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.080]   reading with them, where you're going
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.000]   to be sitting across from them.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.880]   They are not going to see the pictures on the book.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.640]   They're going to see the back of the book.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.240]   And they're going to practice eye contact with mama,
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.400]   the storyteller, the teacher.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.600]   And you're going to read the story, like same thing,
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.880]   a couple of pages, the two pages that are in front of you.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.200]   And then you're going to flip the book around
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.280]   and do the same thing.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.880]   You're going to ask them about, tell me about the pictures.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.400]   What do you see here?
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.960]   And you're going to let them interact with you during that.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.640]   And then you're going to turn it back around, turn the page.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.320]   See, so it's a mom-run story time.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.120]   It's structured.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.440]   It's structured.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.440]   It's beneficial to your child, because they're
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:11.160]   getting all those remarkable practice in learning, right?
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.400]   And understanding and comprehension.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.920]   Yeah, all of that.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.480]   So really, really good.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.280]   You are setting your kids up to become learners.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.720]   Reading is one of the most important things you can do.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.280]   And again, the stories don't have
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.760]   to be long, 5, 10 minutes when they're little.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.680]   And do it at least a couple of times a day.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.640]   Don't negate cuddle time.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.880]   That is very important and so fun, both for parents
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:46.600]   and kids, but also make sure you have a more structured reading
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.000]   time with them every day.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.560]   And you guys will love it, because they
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.480]   will get very good at being learners.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:01.880]   And it's super, super fun to engage with them at that level.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.760]   I love that crisscross applesauce,
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.440]   but I've never understood the connection
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.120]   between the applesauce and crisscross.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.120]   Is that something that--
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.440]   No, I don't.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.480]   It just sounds good.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.240]   Crisscross applesauce, hands in your lap.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.160]   That's what we used to say to our kids, and they all knew.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.240]   They would sit down, little crisscross applesauce,
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.280]   hands in their lap, eyes on mama.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.000]   That's right.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:23.560]   Very good.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.760]   And it was fun.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.840]   We had a good time.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:26.440]   Good deal.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.280]   Yeah, I miss those days.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.520]   Your granddaughter is coming.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.600]   I know, I know.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.320]   Can't wait.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.520]   I love that her mama is an SLP.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.200]   I know, so cool.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.640]   All right, let's talk about video time.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.040]   Video time these days means streaming videos,
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.680]   because I don't think anybody has that video
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.360]   to pop into the VCR anymore, right?
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.480]   So we want to make sure that it's--
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.280]   Not even the DVD.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.720]   --that it's a redeeming video and not a time waster, right?
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.360]   And maybe start out with just 10 minutes at a time.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.720]   Let them sit through the video.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:00.480]   Let them watch it.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.280]   Again, no distractions, though, not in a room full of toys.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   Again, the idea is to focus on the video.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:11.080]   Listen, if they are listening to a video
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.600]   and they have toys to play with and they're not hearing really
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.120]   the video because they're busy playing with the toys,
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:23.160]   we are training our kids to not listen.
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:28.240]   And people are wondering why our kids cannot sit down and focus.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.240]   This is why.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:33.480]   They've got things going at them all the time.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.440]   And it's chaos.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.680]   And they never know that there's a time to sit and learn
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.920]   and listen and a time to play and have fun with the toys.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.120]   Those two things should be separated.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.880]   If we allow the playing with the video time,
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.400]   just know you are sabotaging their ability
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.520]   to pay attention to the person who is speaking.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.040]   Right.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.360]   So be careful with that.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.960]   Now, of course, that doesn't mean they're
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.760]   going to sit there like little robots.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.320]   They can still giggle at a video or something.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.360]   Right?
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.320]   It can be a fun opportunity for them
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.680]   as well as a learning course.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.520]   Yes.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.720]   Those are some of our most fun time.
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.320]   You bet.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:12.840]   OK.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.520]   Yes.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.360]   All right.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.880]   Tantrums.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.960]   Who hasn't had a child that has thrown a tantrum?
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.120]   I mean, it happens a lot.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.200]   We've seen it a lot for sure.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.400]   But we want to train that area as well because it
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:30.320]   is all about self-control.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.440]   It's unacceptable behavior.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.960]   Your child's eyes are on who?
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.400]   On themselves, right?
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:39.360]   And that negatively impacts everyone around them, right?
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.760]   So the first thing you understand
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.280]   is that that child is trying to manipulate you
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.080]   and manipulate others by throwing that tantrum.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.040]   So what do you do?
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:51.680]   Well, first of all, I just want to address all of you
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:56.520]   who may think differently of temper tantrums.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:02.680]   I know most people today are believing that temper tantrums
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.120]   are not really temper tantrums and that they
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:12.280]   are just a form of the child working out self-regulation.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:15.560]   But guys, I am here to tell you that is not the truth.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.480]   When a child is having a temper tantrum,
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.920]   it is because they want what they want.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.320]   And it's just like James says in 4.1,
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.800]   why do you fight and quarrel?
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.880]   Because of the desires that rage within.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:34.440]   You want, but you can't have, so you fight and you quarrel.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:41.160]   So the thing is a temper tantrum is a demand for something.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.520]   It's either a demand for attention
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.440]   or it's a demand for something that they want.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.400]   Now, does self-regulation fit into that?
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.640]   Sure, absolutely.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:55.760]   But they have to learn self-regulation.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.920]   The way it's being presented today--
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.360]   and if you go on and start doing some research
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.680]   and listen to some psychologists,
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.560]   you are going to find that they are saying
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.320]   that self-regulation needs to be taught,
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:14.800]   that it needs to be modeled for them.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.400]   That means mom and dad need to be teaching them
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.560]   what right behavior looks like.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:22.560]   And that doesn't mean mom and dad
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.320]   are the ones that are doing it all
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.960]   and the child doesn't have to
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.240]   because they haven't learned it yet.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.800]   They learn it according to the same practices
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.360]   that we're talking about with everything else.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.920]   If they are in rebellion, there is consequence for that.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.680]   That is something that God does not mix words about.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.920]   He is absolutely clear on that.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:52.080]   So please don't allow yourself to get swept into this idea
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.040]   that it's a phase and they're going to grow out of it.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:00.920]   If it was a phase, we would not have accounts set up
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.400]   for Karens all over the place.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.640]   We would not have people throwing temper tantrums in planes.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:10.640]   We would not see people throwing temper tantrums in stores
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:13.200]   or neighbors screaming at each other.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.360]   Guys, this is a serious issue
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.120]   and people are completely out of control
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.160]   and they've been given excuse to act this way.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.280]   Don't do this to your child.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.520]   It is not necessary.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:31.160]   If you give your child consequences
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:35.040]   for that kind of rebellious behavior
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:38.120]   where their eyes are just so much on themselves
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.760]   that they don't care what happens to anybody else around them
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:45.440]   and you follow through the way God wants you to follow through
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.960]   lovingly, kindly, support them, yes,
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:54.520]   but apply a consequence because this is rebellion,
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:55:00.400]   then your child is no longer going to throw temper tantrums.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.320]   -Right. -I promise.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.240]   -She promises. -I do.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:08.000]   If you apply it the right way, the way we've been learning,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.960]   you will not have to deal with temper tantrums
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:15.120]   and your children do not have to be the ones growing up,
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.760]   throwing themselves to the ground
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.360]   because something didn't go their way.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.480]   So be careful about this.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:26.000]   Don't get swept into the chaos and the craziness
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.160]   that this world is offering right now.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.000]   It's just not right. It's not right.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.320]   -Sure. What about a frustration tantrum?
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.200]   -Yeah. -They can't do something.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.640]   Something doesn't work.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.560]   -Yeah, that's understandable.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.760]   I mean, totally understandable.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.560]   I think I've thrown a few frustration tantrums.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.640]   -Sure. Who hasn't? -Right.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:50.560]   But again, it is a moment where we are absorbed with ourself
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:55.240]   and we're not caring or thinking about the people around us.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.720]   And that comes right back to love God, love your neighbor, right?
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:01.040]   The Lord wants us to be humble.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:04.640]   He wants us to consider others better than ourselves.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.480]   And so in those moments of frustration tantrums,
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:15.040]   it's the same thing in terms of their response to the frustration.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.120]   So what we want to do is teach our children
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.040]   that they can trust mommy and daddy.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.200]   We will always be there to help them.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.600]   -Exactly. -There's a way to get up
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:29.040]   before you throw the temper tantrum and come and talk to mom and dad.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.480]   -Use your words. -And if you don't,
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:37.040]   if you choose to respond by creating chaos in the home,
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:40.800]   then you have to understand that there's going to be a consequence for that.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:44.320]   And when your children grow up understanding that,
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:50.480]   they will not throw temper tantrums because they're frustrated.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:55.040]   They will learn, they will actually self-regulate
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.640]   because they will have learned to make the right choice
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.920]   and that there is a better choice for them to make.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.960]   That's self-regulation.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:08.480]   That's literally what psychiatry calls self-regulation.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:15.400]   But all the parenting experts out there are mixing that all up
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:20.600]   and causing all of you to think that there's nothing that can be done
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.920]   and that you have to just go along with it.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.040]   And I'm telling you, it will not go away.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.160]   Tantrums do not go away.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.760]   -They have to be taught. -They get worse.
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:36.160]   Yes. And we've all seen adults throw a temper tantrum.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.680]   -Road rage. -You do not want it to be your child.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.960]   -Absolutely. -Save your child.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:47.200]   Give them every opportunity to be able to be a responsible adult
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.080]   who knows how to keep their cool.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:55.240]   -You bet. Good. Good deal. -Any questions?
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.520]   And did we talk about isolating the kids when they throw a tantrum?
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:02.400]   -Yes. Did we? -Hopefully we did.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.280]   When they're throwing a temper tantrum, you just pick them up,
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.680]   put them in their room, close the door.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.480]   When they're quiet, when they've quieted down,
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:19.120]   then you go in and you apply a consequence for their action.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.280]   -Okay. -Any questions?
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.800]   I have a question on that.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:28.120]   Our kids' room is also their playroom.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.080]   Like, there's no difference in either of their rooms.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.080]   Between the three of them, they share two rooms
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.040]   and there's always toys for them.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.680]   So is that, like, whenever I tell them, like,
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.880]   "Hey, you need a minute. Mom needs a minute.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:44.800]   You need to go in your room." -Yeah.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.800]   -I, like, I'm fine with it, but I want to know if it's wrong.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.440]   By the time that I go back in there and they're quiet,
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:52.200]   they're playing with toys on their own.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.160]   Like, they're not being mean about it at all,
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.440]   but they're playing with toys.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:00.480]   -And so you're wondering if you need to give a consequence?
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.640]   -No, I do give a consequence, but I'm just wondering, like,
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.360]   do I need to go in there before they're playing with toys
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:11.400]   so that it's not, like, that long, or is that fine?
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:15.520]   -Well, if you've got a child throwing a temper tantrum,
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.160]   that needs to be separated. -Right.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.640]   -Somewhere. -Yeah.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.360]   -So it doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be in their room.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.400]   Find another place in the house where they can --
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:32.920]   So maybe they're going to sit on the sofa until they're calm.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:38.120]   You know, I mean, whatever works for you.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:41.120]   Or maybe they're going to -- If your bathroom is safe,
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:46.040]   they're going to sit on the toilet cover
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:49.440]   and wait for you there.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:53.240]   -My boys will not be -- No.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.920]   I'll have a clogged toilet every time.
[00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.440]   They would get a consequence, but we would get a lot of --
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.480]   -Okay, well, hopefully, you're not going to have that problem
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.760]   after -- -Yeah.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.320]   -Yeah, 'cause that should go away.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.920]   -Yeah. -That should go away,
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:14.080]   and you should be able to put your children in by themselves
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.360]   and have them wait for a few --
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.520]   All I'm saying is wait long enough for them
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.080]   to stop the screaming, yeah. -Yeah.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.920]   -And then go in, apply the consequence,
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.800]   and then restore with them.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.000]   So they need a spot where they can be by themselves
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.240]   during that process. -Yeah.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.360]   -So I don't know where that's going to be in your home.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.440]   Maybe you keep one room for playroom
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:46.240]   and the other room for when you need it
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.120]   to deal with consequences.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.560]   -Okay.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.400]   -I mean, I don't know. You know better, so --
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.280]   -Our middle kid does fine with it.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.520]   It's our little one that he just --
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.240]   I don't know if he just doesn't --
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.480]   Like, I try explaining,
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.840]   but I just don't know if he's, like, fully there.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.800]   I don't know. -If you're explaining
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.400]   prior to or during a temper tantrum,
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.960]   it is not going to work. -Yeah.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.640]   -No. He's not learning.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.920]   He's shut down in that moment.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.160]   He's not going to hear you.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:28.640]   So the chastisement has to come first.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.680]   And, of course, when I'm saying let him calm down,
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.480]   there's times where you don't have to let him calm down.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.720]   If they're not completely out of control
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.640]   and you can give them a chastisement,
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.680]   give them the chastisement as soon as you can.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.360]   That's the quickest way to get to their heart
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.600]   so that that transition can happen, right?
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.000]   I say put them in a room by themselves
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.360]   because if they're completely out of control
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.680]   or if you, as a mom, you're in the middle of something
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.720]   you can't deal with right away,
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.400]   you can put them in their room by themselves,
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.640]   but just get in there as quickly as you can
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.720]   to apply the consequence.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.760]   Does that make sense? -Yeah.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.960]   -Okay. -Thank you.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.320]   -All right. Anybody else?
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.480]   -Yeah, Brittany. -Okay.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.280]   -Quick question.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.920]   So my orthopedic doctor doesn't want me to lifting anything.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.160]   -Lifting? Okay.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.480]   -So my son threw a tantrum today
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.000]   outside with the bike in our backyard,
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.880]   and I had to lift him up to take him inside
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.800]   to calm him down and then to administer a discipline,
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.400]   and he hurt my back.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.320]   So do you have any other suggestions for,
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.480]   instead of picking up, implementing something?
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.160]   -How old is he? -He's 2.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.680]   -You can't lean him by the hand?
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.360]   -I -- He'll fall.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.320]   So I did try.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.480]   He fell to the ground and just, you know,
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.240]   became a floppy fish. -Okay.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.720]   -And he was in your backyard, you say?
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.920]   -Mm-hmm.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   -And is it private back there?
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.000]   -We -- My husband says yes.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   I say no. -Okay.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.960]   -It's our neighbor's backyards with a fence between.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.160]   -Okay. Yeah, I wouldn't do it.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.040]   So I would just tell him to come in the house,
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.360]   and I know he's probably not going to do that,
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.800]   and so when you do get him in the house,
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:38.760]   he's going to have one spanking for the first offense,
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.880]   and then he's going to have another spanking
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.960]   for not coming in when you asked him to.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.160]   -Okay. My husband working from home,
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.640]   I don't want to interrupt him working,
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.600]   but he says, "I'll come out anytime to pick him up
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.280]   and bring him in," but I don't know
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.200]   if that's sending the wrong message to my son.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.640]   -I -- Yeah, I agree.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.640]   I would let your husband do his work,
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.240]   and I would do it this way because he's going to learn
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.880]   quickly that he doesn't have to have the second spanking
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.120]   if he comes in the first time.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.360]   -Got it. Okay.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.320]   -It's going to take you a few days with him.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.360]   -Okay. Thank you.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.120]   -It shouldn't take more than a week.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.200]   If you are consistent with this,
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.480]   it shouldn't take you more than a week.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.720]   -And catching him now that he's 2 years old is really --
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.280]   -Really good. Yes.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.440]   Yeah. -Okay. All right.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.360]   -Good job. -Watch that back.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.480]   -Yeah. No kidding.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.360]   I've got a bad back, too, so I --
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.760]   -You can relate. -I can relate, yes.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.040]   -All right. -Yeah.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.240]   -Let's talk about interruptions.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.120]   We had previously talked about,
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.880]   and hopefully you'll learn the interrupt rule.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.440]   Are you practicing it?
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.200]   Give me some feedback in terms of,
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.440]   are your kids understanding it?
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.000]   Is it working? Are you doing it correctly?
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.640]   Give me some feedback on it.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   -Did you ditch it?
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   -Is anybody practicing this?
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.240]   -My 6-year-old is great with it.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.840]   -Good.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.200]   -Like, she doesn't really interrupt me anymore,
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.160]   or she needs a few reminders.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.640]   My son, we've corrected, and we've corrected,
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.960]   but he's still not -- both of my boys,
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.640]   they just seem to not even care.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.520]   And, like, when I'm on the phone,
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.480]   even when I'm on the phone with Ryan,
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.640]   like, I'll be like, "Okay, you need to go to your room
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.680]   until I can finish this."
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:42.400]   And then I go and talk to him, but it doesn't --
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.240]   -So, I'm going to ask you a question, Sarah.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:49.400]   Are you doing it the minute they don't do
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.240]   what you've asked them to do,
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:56.440]   or do you try to convince them to do it?
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.000]   -I remind them the first time that I'm on the phone.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.920]   Say, "Mommy's on the phone."
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.040]   I'll just say, "Mommy's on the phone,"
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.520]   like, if they don't see that or something.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.960]   And then if they do it again, I'm just,
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.280]   "Okay, you need to go to your room
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.920]   because you're not listening."
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.880]   -Okay, so, just my encouragement to you,
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:20.160]   keep doing that where you are not giving them any debate time
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.280]   because when you give them any debate time at all,
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:27.640]   that's all they need to get their will strengthened
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.200]   so that they know that they can at least get
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:36.400]   that few minutes of tug-of-war before you do
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.320]   what you're telling them you're going to do.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.120]   And I'm saying that not only to you,
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.680]   but everybody else in the class because I know everybody's
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.280]   probably dealing with something similar to that.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.720]   And the more we debate with our children,
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.640]   the stronger their wills get.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:57.600]   So, the more consistent we are in just applying lovingly,
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.800]   no wild emotion coming out of us.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.680]   We're not angry. We're not disappointed.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.800]   We know it's our job to train their hearts,
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.880]   and this is just one more opportunity that we get to do it.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:17.520]   And so, if we're in that mindset and it's an immediate thing,
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:22.240]   your kids are going to learn to obey very quickly.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:27.480]   So, I do understand that you might have a tigger.
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.960]   -That is not the case, yeah. -Yes.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.120]   -So, he will be a tigger all the days of his life.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.120]   -Forever and ever.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.200]   -And so, it's always going to be challenging,
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.120]   but still hold him to that same standard
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.840]   because that is the best thing you can do for those tiggers.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.880]   -Yeah. -They will become the heroes one day.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.840]   -They will. -Is it normal for our tiggers
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.480]   to take longer to learn these things?
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.200]   -Oh, yes. -Oh, sure.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.000]   -Because they're so impulsive, yeah.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.760]   They act before they think.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.840]   And so, yes, yes.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:12.640]   It will get better, but it'll never be gone.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.960]   -Yeah. -It'll never be gone.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.640]   But it will get a lot better as you go.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.720]   It'll get a lot better.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.720]   And they really are learning the lessons,
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.080]   so it really radically impacts their life as adults.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.200]   -Yeah. -It's good.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.160]   -And one of the things that might be helpful --
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.600]   you may or may not be doing this,
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.880]   but it's our next session.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.680]   It talks about the family schedule.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.560]   So, if you're on the phone with someone,
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.600]   they should be doing something else that's on the schedule
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.560]   for them to be busy during that time.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.440]   -Yeah, productive, busy and productive, yeah.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.600]   -So, talk about the family schedule.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:51.320]   -Yeah, I mean, guys, this is such a benefit to families,
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.680]   and, honestly, I think this is the last thing
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.600]   anybody ever applies in "Training Hearts,"
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.280]   and it breaks my heart because I am telling you
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:07.640]   this is such a benefit to you, to be on a schedule.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.040]   And that does not mean that you are a slave to the schedule.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.240]   That just means that you have a framework
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.800]   set up for your family, and the kids are aware of it.
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.000]   They know it.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.400]   They begin to trust you more and more every day
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.520]   because you know what's coming next in the day.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.680]   If you've got any kids out there that are saying,
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.800]   "What are we doing today, Mom? Can we go to the park?
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.040]   I think we should go visit so-and-so,"
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:39.160]   it is because they don't know what they're doing in their day,
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.320]   and it drives them crazy.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.120]   It causes them to feel anxious.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.240]   And so, if you've got a schedule set up,
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.720]   they don't ever have to feel like they need to be the inventor
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.920]   of what happens in their day.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:57.560]   And then that gives them this glorious framework
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.720]   where you've set up different things
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.920]   during the day for them to do,
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.480]   and they can just be as creative within that framework
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.920]   as they want, and it is so much more fun.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.880]   They are so much happier, and you will love it.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:19.200]   So, even in those times where we were off track on the schedule,
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:24.880]   which happened a lot because I believe a schedule is for me,
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.600]   not me for the schedule.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.640]   I'm not -- the schedule is not the authority over me.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.360]   I am the authority over the schedule.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.040]   And so, if I need to break my schedule
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.360]   or if I want to break my schedule,
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.840]   I'm going to break my schedule.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.440]   But in those moments where --
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.040]   and I think I've mentioned this before,
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.320]   coming in with groceries is just probably my best example,
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.240]   and kids all helping me drag the bags in
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.200]   and up onto the counter, and now I'm putting them away,
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:01.640]   and pretty soon the kids are losing control in the other room
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.680]   because they're done bringing in the groceries.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:09.440]   All I would have to do is say, "Guys, what's on the schedule?"
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.440]   And if they didn't know what was on the schedule,
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.880]   they would run to the schedule
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.920]   that was always posted on the refrigerator,
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.640]   and they would look at it, and they'd go,
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.960]   "It's coloring time," or "It's Lego time," or whatever.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.720]   And I'd go, "Okay, go do it," and off they'd go.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.480]   And it was peaceful.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.280]   I didn't have to break up bites or anything.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.320]   I just -- all I had to do was say what was on the schedule.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.760]   And did that happen overnight?
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:41.240]   No, but it happened with consistency over time,
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.920]   and pretty soon my kids were never worried
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.120]   about what was going on in the day.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.240]   And if I wanted to take them over
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.560]   and see some of their friends or go visit
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.400]   or go to the park with some people,
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.720]   we'd pack it up and go.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.480]   We're not a slave to the schedule,
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.800]   but that schedule is a really incredible benefit to you.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.880]   It will help you run your day.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:14.680]   And so I highly, highly, highly, highly recommend it.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.680]   -Sounds like you highly recommend it.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.720]   -I do. I do.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.360]   I hope that at least one of you out there
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.760]   will put your family on a schedule
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.880]   because you will see what a blessing it is.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.360]   -Yeah. -Just, you know,
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.480]   just don't get rigorous about the schedule.
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:39.440]   Just it's a schedule to keep you all within these time boundaries
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.640]   that are amazing because you can be creative
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.320]   within those time boundaries.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.040]   You can get things done.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.520]   We've got questions. -We do.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.640]   But before you say that, the schedule for preschoolers.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.320]   -Yes. -You recommend "Creative Family Times"
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.560]   as a resource? -Yes. Yeah.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.960]   -Okay. -Yeah, that's a great book.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.840]   -Okay, good. -It'll give you some good ideas.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.840]   But, you know, as far as the schedule goes,
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.360]   you start with when they wake up in the morning.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.080]   Do a time and try and get on to that schedule,
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.480]   whatever that time is.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.600]   Make it reasonable.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.680]   Make it, you know, don't do an unrealistic wake-up time,
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.360]   like, "Okay, everybody's going to be brushing their teeth at 530."
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.360]   No, don't do that.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.080]   Do something realistic that everybody can enjoy
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.640]   and then get your mealtimes on the schedule.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.520]   And then I'm sure some of you are doing homeschooling,
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.280]   so get your homeschooling on the schedule.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.120]   But, of course, if you've got a little one
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.440]   that is not homeschooling,
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.200]   you've got to get a schedule for that little one.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.160]   And so, like, I had Natalie.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.800]   She was four years younger than Michael,
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.360]   six years younger than Tori.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.160]   So Tori and Michael were on a schedule
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.320]   that was very, you know, for school, very much for school.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:01.120]   They were on, you know, blocks of subjects.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.360]   So with Natalie, I had to make sure that I had fun,
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:09.840]   little, more preschool-ish types of things set up for her.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.320]   And it was so much fun and easy to homeschool my boys
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:18.880]   because my daughter was very content and happy
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.240]   to move from one station to the next.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.920]   And all those things can be pre-set up in your house.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.760]   You know, we used to have a little table with colors,
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:32.840]   like crayons and coloring books and little kids' scissors
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.680]   and even glue because my kids learned
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.480]   to be self-controlled with the glue.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.520]   And they could do their little projects at the little table,
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.400]   and we would have it for a certain amount of time.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.320]   Maybe it would be 15 to 20 minutes,
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.360]   and then they'd move on to something else.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.760]   So, anyway, I know I'm --
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.480]   -I know, I know.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.520]   -Two more days to cover here. -I just have so much to tell.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.920]   -You do, I know.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.120]   We're going to extend the class to --
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:02.960]   -No. -Okay.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.920]   We had a question real quick.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.680]   -I just wanted to say, when I listened to your podcast
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.080]   a couple weeks ago, Sharon, on "Date Nights with the Woods,"
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.640]   we implemented a calendar where it has, like,
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.240]   visuals because my boys can't read yet.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.440]   -Oh, sorry.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.400]   -It has made all the difference with our oldest
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.360]   because he would ask me 30 times a day,
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.760]   "What are we doing now?
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.800]   What are we doing now?
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.320]   Maybe we should do this."
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.680]   And now he knows, so during breakfast time,
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:33.080]   he goes through the list with his little brother
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.560]   and says, "This is what we're doing,"
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.480]   and "Mom's changed the schedule,"
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.320]   and "This is when we'll do this."
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.520]   -They are so happy.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.920]   -It's made, like, so much easier.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.920]   -Good. -Like, so much easier.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.280]   -That's great. -Thank you for your testimony.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.320]   -Yes, so good.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.360]   -So everybody doesn't have to think
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.920]   I'm just a crazy lady over here.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.520]   -Take it to heart.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.560]   -It is so helpful.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.200]   I'm so glad that helped you.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.720]   Good job. -Okay.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.720]   Now, I'm going to fly through the rest here
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.360]   because we have a lot to cover.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.760]   -That was so important, though.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.240]   -It was, definitely.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:08.640]   Playtime, make sure you make time in the schedule
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.920]   also for playtime,
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.480]   time when the child can play by himself, right?
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.600]   -Yes. -And make sure --
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.440]   And also some other suggestions.
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.920]   You can have mommy and daddy time, memorization time,
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.120]   sit time, talk time, et cetera.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.320]   -Bible time. -Bible time.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.520]   -Make sure you get Bible time in there, prayer time.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.720]   -Yeah, you've got all those good things.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:30.080]   Let's go to day four, discipline and correction,
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.720]   reviewing the points from Ted Tripp's DVD.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.200]   We have corrective, and then we have formative,
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.760]   so make sure you know the difference
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:41.120]   and understand how they work with each other, okay?
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.200]   The circle of blessing, hopefully you guys are using that.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.040]   It is a great visual, a great opportunity
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.360]   to bring your child to a place
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.160]   where they have an actual understanding
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.600]   of what it means to be in that circle of blessing.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:59.680]   -Hopefully your kids are seeing that and loving it.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.720]   -Yeah. -No, you don't do that.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.880]   -No, you don't do that, yeah.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.280]   -So, yeah, so they're getting on board
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.960]   with the circle of blessing, as well.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.400]   Anybody's kids getting excited about the circle of blessing?
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.080]   -I hope so. -Raise your hand.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.200]   Oh, good. There's one.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.520]   -Yeah. Anyway, it's a good tool.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.840]   We just encourage you to use it.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.320]   -Maybe you guys aren't using the circle of blessing.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.640]   -Yeah. Let's move on.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:33.040]   Question number 25, when does a child need the rescue rod?
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.000]   Okay, when a child receives instructions
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.640]   that he understands and has the capacity to obey
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.280]   but does not obey without question,
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.000]   delay, or excuse, then he needs the rescue rod, right?
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.680]   -We have a lot of pages left.
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.080]   -I know we do, yes.
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.480]   Understanding some of the key points
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.760]   of giving that chastisement,
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.920]   you want to do it in a private place, right?
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.720]   Not a spectator sport.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.800]   And you want to make sure that this is a specific situation
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.080]   where the child has failed to honor and obey.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.040]   Again, don't focus on the circumstance.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.240]   Focus on the sin issue, right?
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.680]   Make sure you do that.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:12.080]   When a child lies, real quick, can you give us our impression
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.160]   of what Ted Tripp said versus how we kind of want to approach it
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.160]   and how Coswell and Lilly approaches it?
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:21.000]   -Okay, so Ted Tripp kind of was like,
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.360]   "I'm not going to call my child a liar,"
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.360]   and I agree with that.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.440]   Obviously, you know,
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:32.120]   we do not want to call our children a sin, right?
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.240]   We don't want to classify them as a liar.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:39.800]   But the fact of the matter is you are the adults,
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.200]   and if you know that your child lied, your child lied.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:48.160]   And so just like in this lesson where we talk about Sarah
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.920]   and how the angels responded to her, "Yes, you did lie,"
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.800]   it was very point-blank, and I loved that
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.120]   because it's like, "Yes, she did lie."
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.480]   -Absolutely, you bet.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.160]   -And that's how we need to deal with our children
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.640]   and help them to recognize that a lie
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:11.040]   is not going to be able to be hidden.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.960]   There might be occasions where they get away with it,
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.520]   but as a rule, if they practice lying,
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.160]   it is going to be seen by everybody.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.880]   Usually the liar is the only one that doesn't know
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.200]   that their lies aren't being believed.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.040]   -Yeah, and I think we give some good scenarios here
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.840]   in terms of kind of what to look for.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:34.280]   Under question number 31, you'll see those,
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.920]   and hopefully you had a chance to review those
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.600]   and understand those, as well.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.040]   So important. -Okay, thank you so much.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:43.080]   -Yep. We want to make sure, of course, that after spanking,
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.000]   you want to be able to restore with your child.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.360]   You want to affirm your love for your child, right?
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.480]   You want to make sure you check your own spirit
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:53.240]   if it hasn't worked and there's a problem
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.080]   that's happening in terms of the restoration.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.280]   Did you handle your child roughly, right?
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.160]   Were you out of control?
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.720]   And again, if you feel that you were, you need to apologize.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.560]   If you feel that you are,
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.400]   you need not to proceed with the spanking
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.720]   until you're in the right place with the Lord, okay?
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.560]   Also, check his spirit, as well.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.240]   We give you some good pointers on how to do that.
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:19.280]   Prayer during the restoration process, so important, right?
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.720]   We need to make sure that we have that tender moment
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.240]   of embracing our child, helping them understand the gospel,
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.000]   comforting them, and then praying with them
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.600]   and teach them to pray.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.440]   And your prayer for them can be instructive.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.880]   They don't want to pray,
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.920]   but again, it's good to do that, as well.
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.200]   Let's see.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:44.760]   We want to be sure that we are sensitive to timing
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.560]   when we give instructions.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.160]   Again, this is still in day four.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.000]   Give them a little warning.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:51.960]   Prepare their hearts.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.920]   If they're in the middle of watching a video
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.160]   or doing a game, give them a five-minute warning.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.360]   - Building something important with Legos
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.880]   and all of those kinds of things.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.360]   It would be like having a boss walk in
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.360]   when we're in the middle of accomplishing a project
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.600]   and telling us, "Right now, you have to do this."
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.800]   That's hard to transition,
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.680]   and so it's good with our kids, too.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:17.600]   If we can, this is not something
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.560]   that is going to happen all the time,
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.360]   but if you can, give them a five-minute warning
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.720]   before they actually have to do something.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.760]   So bedtime is a perfect example.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.920]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.760]   So I won't carry on.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:34.880]   - You will eventually, but not right now.
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:39.000]   You also want to be sensitive to their development, okay?
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.240]   If they're in kindergarten or under the kindergarten age,
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.880]   sometimes they don't understand those positional words,
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.600]   behind, around, beneath, under.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.920]   Giving instructions with the positional words,
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.200]   they may not completely understand
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.360]   what you're talking about.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.880]   So again, that's a learning process as well with our kids
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.680]   to help them understand those positional words, right?
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.120]   Step at a time.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.160]   Day five, the appeal process.
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.360]   You're not going to be using the appeal process
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.200]   unless your children are characterized
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.160]   by first-time obedience, right?
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.000]   Okay?
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.920]   So hopefully you're working in that area.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:20.120]   To appeal a decision by mom or dad first of the month,
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:23.360]   they must be humble and they must be respectful,
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.040]   and they must, regardless of what your decision is,
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.600]   if you grant the appeal or not after hearing it,
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.080]   they must still be obedient.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:30.920]   - Yeah.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.640]   So for a person who has like a two-year-old
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.240]   and you're learning all of this,
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.560]   your child could technically be ready
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:42.520]   for the appeal process by about five, five years old.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.760]   So, but all those who have five-year-olds
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.720]   are now in their mind thinking,
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:51.160]   "Oh, then I can give my child the appeal process."
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.760]   And that's not actually true
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:57.000]   because if you're just starting this kind of parenting,
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.960]   your child is probably not ready for the appeal process.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.080]   It is important to give it to them
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:06.880]   because this is the beginning of getting them ready
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.600]   to make good and wise decisions for themselves.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.280]   And so we don't give that over to them,
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:18.600]   but we work them into that as they start to grow older
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.680]   so that by the time they're walking out of your house,
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:25.000]   they are not only obedient and self-controlled,
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.560]   but they are very capable of making wise decisions
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:33.240]   and wise choices and to solve problems wisely.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:37.000]   - Yes, well said, good job on that, absolutely.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.400]   The rest of the session, session five,
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.880]   gives you an understanding of what is an appeal,
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:46.240]   how is it misused, how to rightly appeal,
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.800]   what is the process itself,
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.880]   and then five reasons for an appropriate appeal.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.880]   So hopefully you'll be able to utilize those
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.640]   as you continue to train up your children.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.200]   And hopefully you'll see that it's a great system to have.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.400]   - It is a good system.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.360]   - Yeah, and really builds that trust.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.800]   - And it keeps us from being legalists, right?
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:08.880]   It keeps us from saying, "Do it because we said so," right?
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.360]   It gives the child an option to be able to come,
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:16.520]   if necessary, and appeal your instruction.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.440]   So it's really good.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.320]   - Yep, and that's the end of day five.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.000]   - Wow, look at that, look what you did.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.280]   - Look what I did, yeah.
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.360]   - Right on time.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.280]   - Yes, hopefully you guys are reading the material.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.760]   I know I breezed through a lot of that towards the end,
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.880]   but it's your job to do it too.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.360]   - Look, they're all wiped out.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.280]   - Yeah, they're wiped out.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.800]   I'm gonna have Sharon close us out
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.480]   and then we'll get into Q&A, all right?
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:41.400]   Go ahead.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.840]   - Father God, thank you so much for this night.
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.080]   Thank you for giving all of these parents
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:52.360]   just the self-control to get through this session tonight.
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.040]   There was so much information.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.360]   I know their brains are probably just bogged down right now,
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:01.280]   but Lord, we love you so much,
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.760]   and we know, God, how faithful you are
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.360]   to come alongside us throughout the week.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:10.640]   So I do pray, God, that they would be just sensitive
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.080]   to your Holy Spirit and to the promptings, Lord,
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.880]   the reminders of what they need to apply
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.920]   and when they need to apply it.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.600]   So thank you, Lord, for being who you are.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.800]   Thank you, God, that we are able to serve you,
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.960]   that you accept our service.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.760]   What a grace and a gift that is.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:34.400]   And Lord, I just pray that we would serve you in a way
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.640]   all week long that would bring you glory and praise.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.360]   And we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.200]   - Amen.
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:43.040]   - All right.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.200]   - All right, Q&A.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.560]   - Okay, Q&A, guys.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.400]   Fire away.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:53.080]   It takes them a moment to reorient.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:53.920]   - It does.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.080]   To figure out what their question.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.400]   - Do I have a question?
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.360]   - Can I just say, it's not really a question,
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.520]   but I just wanted to say,
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.960]   Joshua was able to stay in his classroom
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:07.160]   the whole time on Sunday.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.240]   He did, 'cause I was serving,
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.400]   so I had to walk by his classroom.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.400]   And when he saw me, he's like,
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.560]   "Mom, can I have a hug?"
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.400]   And I was like, "Absolutely,
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.200]   "I'll come in and give you a hug."
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.680]   And then he tried again.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.600]   He was like, "I wanna go with you."
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.760]   And I said, "Bud, if you're going with me,
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:25.920]   "we're going home.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:26.960]   "We're not doing this.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:28.320]   "You have to be obedient."
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.400]   "Okay, Mom, I'm sorry."
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.560]   And that was that.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.440]   - Good job, Sarah.
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.080]   - The victory there.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.880]   - Love that.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:39.720]   Well done.
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:42.600]   - Okay.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.600]   - All right.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.800]   Jason Lacey.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.320]   - Hi there.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.840]   Caught you, huh?
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.320]   - Can we talk about number 38 on day four a little bit?
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.520]   - 38 on day four.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:00.360]   - Are we not supposed to use the rod
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.880]   with our older children?
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.720]   - Not necessarily.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.200]   So, I mean, yes, you should.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.080]   So how old?
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.240]   - Seven.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:14.120]   - Oh, yes, absolutely.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.080]   Yes.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:20.000]   - So the question is if your child is five years or younger,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.280]   you are right on schedule for using the rod.
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:24.600]   - This goes back to what I was talking about,
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.880]   that if you're in here and you've got a two-year-old
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.520]   and you're starting to train them in this way,
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.760]   probably by five,
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:35.480]   they're gonna be able to handle the appeal process.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:38.560]   It goes the same way with the spankings.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.080]   Like if somebody's got a two-year-old
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.760]   and they're just really getting into this
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.320]   or even younger than two-year-old
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:48.440]   and they're just starting to really train their hearts,
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.480]   by five years old, there's gonna be less spankings.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.800]   It's not gonna be gone.
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.080]   There's still gonna be some rebellion
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.320]   that's gonna crop up every now and then.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.160]   But for the most part,
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.480]   for the parent who was doing this faithfully
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.200]   for the first five years of that child's life,
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:10.440]   there's not gonna be very many spankings by five years old.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:13.160]   But if you're just now learning this
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.560]   and there's a lot that needs to be undone
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.480]   because you haven't been practicing these principles,
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:23.120]   you're probably very actively spanking at this point.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.160]   The good news is if you continue
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.840]   to consistently train your seven-year-old,
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:34.040]   I would say by the time a year goes by,
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:38.000]   you are gonna see a radical difference in your son
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.680]   and you will see less spankings probably in a year.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.520]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:49.520]   So if you're consistent and you're really practicing this
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.640]   and they're older, they learn quickly.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.120]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.800]   - Okay, so if she doesn't have problems with,
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.000]   she obeys right away,
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.880]   but maybe she's a little bit more prideful.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:05.000]   It's our firstborn, so she struggles with just,
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.120]   'cause she's better than her sisters at everything.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:13.120]   So do you, how do you, do you spank for that or?
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:18.160]   - So if that pride comes out in a disrespectful
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:21.600]   or a hurtful way towards others, yes.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:22.440]   - Okay.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:27.440]   - But if it's kind of the, just, you see it in the eyes.
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.400]   - She's fluffed up. - Yeah.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.800]   Yeah, the face- - I would, yeah.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:37.320]   I would do good Bible study with her,
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.960]   pull out some of the good books and good stories
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.400]   about the ones who were super prideful
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.800]   versus the ones who were humble.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:50.360]   I love Abigail.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.760]   I don't know if you remember that story, David and Abigail.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:59.760]   She was married to a very brute man, very awful man.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:03.200]   And she was as humble as can be.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:08.200]   And David called her wise and discerning.
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:13.160]   And so she was rewarded for her humility.
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.360]   Anyway, it's a great story,
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.720]   but there's all kinds of good stories
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.920]   about pride and humility in the Bible.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:24.000]   If you need help, you know, like email or text me
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   and I'll shoot you some passages to take her through.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.280]   So I would do that with her.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:36.280]   And then the other thing I would do is have her serve.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:40.120]   So every time you see that pride come up,
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.240]   you know, an eye roll or just kind of,
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:45.520]   you know that she's resisting,
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:48.920]   but it's not enough to give her a spanking, put her to work
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.760]   and let her heart be humbled by serving her siblings.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.720]   Whoever she was doing it towards,
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:59.360]   she should serve that person.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.240]   - Okay, that makes sense.
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.320]   - Okay.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.640]   - Yes, thank you.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:06.240]   - That would be the natural consequence or not natural,
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:08.080]   the related consequence.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:08.920]   - Yeah.
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:09.760]   - Okay.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.440]   Okay, great.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.560]   Thank you, that helps.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:13.600]   - Welcome.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.000]   - Daniel, you had a question.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.360]   - So our question is about the,
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.640]   when we're applying discipline,
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:26.000]   it says in the workbook to do it on their thigh, right?
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.600]   And to keep their pants on.
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.440]   - Yeah.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:31.040]   - So we tried doing that, but then,
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.640]   well, we tried doing that.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.440]   It's sometimes they have a,
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:38.480]   so do you do it on skin or do you do it on the?
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.240]   - So do you have the wisdom marker that we recommend?
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.960]   - Oh, it is on its way.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:46.280]   - Okay.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.120]   All right.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:51.080]   And that's why I generally say the top of the thigh,
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.360]   because here's the thing,
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:55.840]   Ted Tripp recommends that you take the pants down.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.120]   - Bare bottom, yeah.
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.000]   - And I don't necessarily agree with that.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.680]   I don't think that's necessary.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:09.560]   And I do think that there's a dignity issue with that.
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:14.560]   And because we use the wisdom marker, it's not necessary.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:19.080]   So it has enough of a sting
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.600]   that it will go right through a pair of jeans.
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.880]   So when I say the top of the thigh,
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:28.440]   that's for the one that's got a big diaper on.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:29.600]   - Oh, I see.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.440]   - Yeah.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:34.200]   So if it's not a diapered child,
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.960]   you can go right on the buttocks.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.200]   - Oh, okay.
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.080]   - Yeah.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.640]   - I see, I see, I see.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.960]   Okay.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:42.800]   - Good.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.560]   - Good question.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.880]   I'm glad we could clarify that.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.120]   - Sorry, one last quick question.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:53.080]   So when you guys are talking about the,
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.760]   like giving them a, like a warning,
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:59.000]   like a two minute warning or a five minute warning.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.080]   So do you advise to do that as much as we can?
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:05.400]   Or because one of the things that we were thinking about was
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:08.200]   do we want to teach them that they need to have a warning
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.640]   every single time before?
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.280]   - No, no.
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.320]   - So how do you know when to give them a warning
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.560]   and when not to give them a warning?
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.560]   - Yeah, I mean, it's like a lot of times
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.720]   you're not even going to be able to give them a warning
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.240]   because you just need them to do
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.840]   what they need to do right now.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:24.680]   - To be obedient.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:27.760]   - And so they need to learn to be obedient.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.840]   How old are your little ones?
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:31.040]   - Five, three, and one.
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.480]   - Yeah.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:37.320]   The five-year-old might be at a good age for a warning.
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:42.600]   If the three-year-old is characterized by obedience,
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:47.600]   I would say the three-year-old could have a warning.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:53.200]   But the five-year-old is probably at an age where...
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.560]   Is it a he?
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.360]   - The five-year-old is a girl.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:57.920]   - The five-year-old doesn't need a warning.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.440]   - Yeah, she doesn't need a warning.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:00.280]   She's very like...
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.680]   - It's more the three-year-old.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:02.520]   - Okay.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:06.080]   So no, you don't have to give the three-year-old a warning,
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:09.600]   but I would plan on doing that in the future.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.440]   So when your three-year-old gets a little bit older
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:17.320]   and is fully engaged in something
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:21.760]   and you know that that's gonna be a tough break
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:25.600]   for them to make, and you have five minutes,
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.960]   like let's say you know bedtime, right?
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:31.720]   You know that it's gonna be whatever it is, 7.30.
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:35.840]   And so your child is just engaged
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.600]   in whatever it is they're doing,
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.120]   and you're looking at the clock and it's 7.15,
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:41.960]   and you're thinking,
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:46.160]   "This is probably gonna be a rough time for my child
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:49.120]   to all of a sudden hear that it's time to go to bed."
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:49.960]   - Change gears.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.840]   - That's a good time to just throw out,
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:56.760]   "Hey, bud, you get a five-minute warning here,
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.920]   just want you to know bedtime's coming up,
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.840]   so you're gonna wrap it up in five minutes."
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:04.880]   That's just kind of grace,
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.080]   to give them that little five minutes
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.560]   to know I'm working on something here
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:15.200]   that is so important to me,
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:19.600]   or I'm watching a TV show that I'm really engaged in,
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.680]   and to know, "Okay, I've gotta be done with this
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.040]   in five minutes, so what am I gonna do?
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:30.320]   Am I going to put it on pause in five minutes?"
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:33.640]   You know, it gives them time to think wisely
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:36.080]   about what their choices are.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.480]   And then at that time,
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:43.080]   "Okay, dude, it's 7.30, up you go, it's time for bed."
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.200]   He has every reason to be obedient to you.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:53.520]   - So would you intentionally not give him a warning?
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:55.200]   'Cause right now, I do give him warnings,
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.960]   and he responds very well to the warnings.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.600]   - This is a three-year-old.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:00.440]   - Three-year-old, yeah.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.040]   He responds very well to the warnings right now.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:04.600]   Is it okay to continue doing this?
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.000]   - Here's what I would do, Daniel,
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.240]   and I think this is always a good idea,
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.920]   and you guys will find all kinds of opportunities
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.040]   to do this.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.960]   Because you're asking me,
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:16.440]   I think the bottom-line question
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.840]   that you're asking yourself is,
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:22.400]   is he capable of first-time obedience?
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.400]   And that's a really good question,
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:28.160]   because he needs to be capable of first-time obedience
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.360]   without a warning.
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.720]   And so what I would do is not give him a warning
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.840]   on something, and see how he responds.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.720]   And if he falls apart,
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.360]   you gotta give him a consequence for that.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.080]   And he does need to learn that lesson
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.480]   that there's gonna be times
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:50.680]   when daddy and mommy cannot give you a warning,
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.680]   or we're just not going to give you a warning.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:59.280]   And that's a choice, and you need to trust mom and dad.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.440]   And so here's what happens.
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:04.840]   - That's a lot.
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:06.760]   - Yeah, do that a few times.
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.480]   And then down the road,
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:12.760]   we usually talk about this with red cup, blue cup.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.040]   And if a child is really accustomed
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:16.880]   to having a red cup all the time,
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.000]   and that's his favorite cup,
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.280]   and he only drinks out of the red cup,
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:22.120]   we always, and parents say,
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.080]   "Is it okay if he's only drinking out of the red cup?"
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:29.640]   And we say, "Well, what if the red cup
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.280]   "is in the dishwasher one morning?
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:34.640]   "Give him the blue cup, and let's see what happens."
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.640]   If he's not okay with the blue cup, then we have a problem.
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.320]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.280]   So sometimes it's actually a smart idea
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:49.280]   to set up a scenario where it's going to challenge them
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.520]   to see where's the heart.
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.520]   Is the heart willing to obey?
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:58.480]   And if they are, then fine, let them go back to the red cup.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:04.680]   And if yours is willing to obey with no warning,
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:08.280]   and you want to go back to giving them a warning, do it.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.320]   There's nothing wrong.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.000]   But I would test it every now and then,
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.120]   because you're right.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:19.120]   If that can actually feed their self-importance,
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:26.240]   believing that you have to play by the rules,
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.880]   whereas that's not the way it goes.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.720]   Mom and dad set the rules,
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:34.040]   and those rules are able to change
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:38.760]   whenever mom and dad deem that it's time to change the rule.
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.320]   So.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.560]   - Yeah, and use your discernment,
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.040]   and be selective about the times
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.720]   that you are going to give a warning.
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.200]   You don't have to do it every single time.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:50.920]   - No, you definitely don't, no.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:54.280]   In fact, you could even be,
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:57.000]   what's the term I'm looking for?
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.160]   Enabling.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.320]   - Yeah, by giving too many warnings.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:00.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:04.080]   So it's good to split that up a little bit.
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.760]   - Yeah, be careful.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.960]   Okay, go to Jenna.
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.880]   - Hi, Jenna.
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:09.720]   - Hi.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:12.280]   Well, how do you handle a child
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.680]   that you're trying to,
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:14.680]   that's throwing a tantrum,
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.120]   and you're trying to do isolation,
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.160]   and they're throwing enough of a tantrum
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.680]   that you can't isolate them?
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.640]   - Yeah, I would not.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:24.720]   If you've got a child that is that out of control,
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:29.040]   that child needs their spanking ASAP.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:32.000]   So don't, I wouldn't leave a child in a room
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.640]   to destroy the room.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:39.160]   - Yeah, does that help?
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.040]   - Well, I just, we had the other day,
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:45.040]   basically a four-year-old,
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.000]   she had been a little sick.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.080]   And so there were a few days
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.080]   where she didn't want to go with our babysitter.
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.280]   And I could tell she was sick.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:53.360]   Like she literally didn't,
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.800]   then fell asleep and she doesn't take a nap.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:57.560]   But she kind of got the bit in her teeth
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:58.840]   and she really liked that.
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:39:59.680]   - Yeah.
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:04.000]   - So then she started just making random consist decrees.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.120]   Like, I want daddy to unbuckle me
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.400]   when I would try to unbuckle her.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.040]   And we didn't go along with this
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.080]   'cause I recognized what was happening.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.480]   And it was like, it slowly boiled until,
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.080]   and Gabe and I decided like, okay, basically,
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.320]   whichever one she asked for,
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:22.040]   we're like, oh, actually it's gonna be mommy that does it
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.680]   or it's gonna be daddy that does it.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:27.400]   And it got to the point where she was getting out of the bath
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.960]   and she wanted me to help her.
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:31.440]   And I said, no, mommy's doing this.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.240]   Daddy's gonna help you with your teeth.
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.960]   And she just locked it.
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:39.800]   And thinking and repeating this thinking didn't help.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.640]   And we-
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:43.120]   - Uh-oh.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.280]   - Oh, Jenna, you just froze.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:48.200]   - She doesn't know she froze.
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:49.040]   - No.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:55.840]   Did she freeze for everybody or just everybody?
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.000]   Yeah, okay.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.760]   - She'll come back.
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.400]   - Oh, Jenna.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.280]   - Hey.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:03.120]   - Oh, she's back.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:04.760]   - Jenna, you froze-
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:05.720]   - In my bath?
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:09.160]   - Yeah, for like the last 20 seconds.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.720]   - What, okay, what point did I freeze?
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:13.440]   - Oh, gosh.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:17.600]   You were talking about that she just lost it.
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.440]   She just-
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.560]   - Yeah, so she lost it.
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.560]   And so we ended up taking turns
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:22.920]   kind of just holding her on our lap
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.960]   and she just kind of flailed around
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.640]   for like a good 20 minutes.
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:29.440]   And then finally calmed down.
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.840]   And since then I've had to, you know,
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.920]   give a thinking a few times for that kind of behavior,
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.120]   but she hasn't completely lost it like that again.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:39.960]   - Yeah.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:40.800]   - But at that point,
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:41.960]   I didn't really know what to do with her
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:44.800]   except to just kind of restrain her on my lap
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.320]   because she was just flailing.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.160]   - Yeah.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:51.760]   I mean, that sometimes you just have one of those moments
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:55.680]   where, you know, either you leave them in their room
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:57.920]   if they're safe in there,
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.760]   if they can be safely left in there
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.160]   and they're not going to destroy their room,
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:05.080]   or you do what you did
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.680]   and you keep her restrained in your lap.
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:10.960]   I mean, that's a very loving way,
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:12.640]   as long as you're not angry,
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:15.800]   loving way to deal with it.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:18.080]   I don't think that's the only necessary way.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:19.520]   I know that's a big,
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:26.000]   one of the big go-tos for the new style of parenting
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.440]   and it's not necessary.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:31.040]   There are times that that will work.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.960]   So the goal is to get her to that place
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:38.000]   where she can finally hear you
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.080]   and where you can apply,
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.760]   where'd she go?
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:42.600]   There you are.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:45.520]   And you can apply a consequence.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:52.240]   And so, like you said, she's never gotten that bad again.
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:54.600]   Well, that doesn't surprise me.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:57.360]   And so it's going to keep getting better
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:00.440]   as long as you're consistent with this.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.840]   And here's the thing,
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.080]   our kids can so easily
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:11.480]   find themselves to be in charge.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:14.440]   And when they're in that position,
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.520]   they don't trust mom and dad.
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:22.360]   And so when you see your child starting to surrender back,
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:27.240]   that is such an amazing spot for them to be in
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:29.120]   because they're back in a position
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:32.720]   where the relationship is right with you guys
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.000]   and they're at peace.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.200]   And so that's the wonderful thing about this
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.400]   is you saw that happen.
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.920]   You dealt with it the right way.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:46.200]   She has not gone to that extreme again
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:48.400]   and she's going to come out of this.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:52.840]   You just have to be loving and consistent with her.
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:54.400]   - Okay, yeah, that was my,
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:55.640]   my question was coming at it from,
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:58.040]   'cause I knew about it as day listening
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:01.640]   from the, you know, gentle parenting or whatever.
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:04.640]   Which, yeah.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:07.000]   - We should be gentle, right?
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.200]   We should be gentle.
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:11.040]   We just don't want to get caught up in the,
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.640]   it is interesting 'cause like I said,
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:16.200]   I've been doing research on all of this
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:19.800]   and it's so sad to me.
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:22.960]   And this is because we know the biblical way.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:26.680]   We know that there is hope in acknowledging sin
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:29.680]   and that there is a conclusion to it, right?
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.240]   We can overcome sin.
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:34.600]   God has given us the way to do that.
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:39.040]   And in psychology, they have nothing to apply.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.440]   And that's the interesting thing.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.320]   I keep saying, okay, but then what?
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:43.160]   Then what?
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:44.240]   Then what?
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.640]   You know, it sounds wonderful,
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.240]   but I keep going, but what's the answer?
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:51.240]   Where do you tell parents to go from there?
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:53.960]   And they never have the solution.
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.080]   They move into this and then the child will be this
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.040]   and be that.
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.320]   And I'm like, how did the child get there?
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:04.480]   You missed a whole passage in here, right?
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:06.360]   And they just erase that out
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:09.920]   because they cannot deal with sin, psychologists,
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:11.880]   and they cannot deal with guilt.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:16.040]   So they can't address any of that in their materials.
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:17.840]   And so they have all these things,
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.200]   like even, you know, the brain scans, you know,
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:25.840]   they're so right and they fit right in biblically.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:28.200]   It's very true what they're saying.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.080]   And you can go to the scriptures and go,
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.560]   well, God already told us that, right?
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:33.640]   If you only believed,
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:35.840]   you wouldn't have had to do a brain scan.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:37.680]   We already know it.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:39.960]   And so it's so incredible
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:42.920]   because they have all these right pieces
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.720]   and then they skip the solution
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.680]   because they don't really have one.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.200]   And then all of a sudden you're down here
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.920]   and they're promising all this wonderful response
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.600]   and everything will be peachy
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.840]   and they'll grow up and grow out of it.
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:58.960]   And I'm like, oh,
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:02.560]   there are so many parents believing that, right?
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:05.120]   And this generation of kids,
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.440]   they're gonna be the ones getting dragged off airplanes,
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:10.280]   right?
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:12.000]   It's just so sad.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.920]   So anyway, I understand anybody
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.760]   that gets pulled into the gentle parenting,
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:21.040]   but, and we should be gentle parents.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.680]   That's why we talk so much about, you know,
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.440]   not being angry.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:29.560]   And even in these high energy moments
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:33.120]   with our kids having these horrible temper tantrums,
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:37.320]   it is a time when we have to not let our emotions
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:39.200]   get out of hand, right?
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:42.200]   We are going to go and do our job.
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:46.160]   Our job is to lovingly come around our kids
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.040]   and bring them through it.
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:52.280]   But we have the solution to bring it to an end,
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:54.000]   but we have to do it with the right heart,
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.480]   the right attitude and keep that relationship strong.
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:00.280]   And what ends up happening is we have children
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:03.920]   who trust their parents, love their parents,
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:07.200]   have relationships with their parents,
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.360]   and that's the solution, right?
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.280]   And eventually we hope and pray
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:15.880]   that that is also going to encourage them
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:18.760]   to walk with the Lord when the Holy Spirit
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:20.600]   does his work in them.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.120]   - So gentle yet biblical.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:23.960]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:24.800]   - Absolutely.
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.760]   - Yeah, if we're not biblical, it is just not gonna work.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.160]   It's God's world.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:33.720]   He made the rules, right?
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:36.000]   And so if we try and change those rules,
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.720]   what's gonna happen?
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:41.320]   - We'll all be outside the circle of blessing chaos.
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:42.160]   - Chaos.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.000]   - Yes, yes.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.440]   And we are seeing chaos.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:45.280]   - Let's go to Jake.
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:46.840]   - Yeah.
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:47.960]   Thank you, Jenna.
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:51.160]   - Hi, yeah. - Thank you.
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.880]   - Sorry, I've got two questions.
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.120]   I know you've already answered them,
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.600]   but I don't remember the answers.
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:59.280]   So first, where can I buy the wisdom worker?
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:03.960]   - Okay, so I will put that in the chat.
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:06.600]   Give me just a moment to do that.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.280]   (clears throat)
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:21.240]   Where is it?
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.080]   There it is.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.560]   Okay, here it comes.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:31.240]   There you go.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:32.280]   - Awesome, thank you.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.360]   - You're welcome.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.160]   - Yep, second question.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.920]   How old is too old for a spanking?
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:40.560]   - Okay, that's a good question.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.160]   That comes up all the time
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.720]   and I'm really surprised we haven't addressed that yet.
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:46.560]   Oh, it does?
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:49.240]   Okay, well, I'm gonna go ahead and share it.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:54.640]   Here's the thing, and we will repeat this next week
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.800]   because it's important for everybody to hear it,
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:01.360]   but when we give a spanking, what's it for?
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:04.400]   Jake, that's the question.
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.520]   - It's a consequence.
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:08.080]   - Yeah, it's a consequence, but why are we giving it?
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.120]   It's for rebellion.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:11.160]   - Yeah, true.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.000]   - For rebellion, okay.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.240]   So, and the point of the chastisement, the spanking,
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:21.040]   is to humble the heart, right?
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:26.040]   So the answer to that question is we give a spanking
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.280]   anytime our child is in rebellion.
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:35.760]   And if we don't, our child will continue in rebellion.
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.560]   So there's not really an age limit.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.160]   And just to encourage you a little bit,
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:48.160]   we had, Tori and Michael were two years apart.
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:54.120]   They each, at the age of 14 each,
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.920]   they were characterized by obedience.
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:00.040]   They were sweet kids.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:01.440]   Michael was still a tigger.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:05.720]   So yes, there were still issues and nobody's perfect.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:09.440]   Tori wasn't perfect, but they were good, obedient kids.
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:15.720]   And when they turned, and I was the administrator
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.440]   of their school all their life.
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:20.560]   And then off Tori went to high school,
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.640]   no longer had mom there.
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:25.040]   So of course he came on freshman year
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:28.600]   and there was a challenge and he was like,
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.560]   "Nope, I'm gonna do it."
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:32.880]   And he dug his heels in with me.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:35.600]   I'm saying, "Honey, don't do this.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:38.800]   "You know this is not gonna go well, don't do this."
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.040]   And he's like, "Nope, I'm gonna do it."
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:44.680]   And I called Mario and said,
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.200]   "You are not gonna believe this,
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:50.120]   "but Tori is in complete direct rebellion to me."
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:53.440]   And he's told me he's doing something,
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.360]   whether I like it or not.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:58.480]   And Mario came home and he sat down with Tori,
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.640]   had a nice talk.
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:04.480]   And Tori ended up at age 14 getting a spanking
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.040]   from his father, not from his mother.
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:08.400]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:10.080]   And that was the last- - At 14, no.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.520]   - That was the last- - Mom, let's not do it.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.720]   - That was the last spanking he ever got.
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:14.160]   - Last spanking he ever had,
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:17.160]   last time he was ever rebellious.
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.800]   Now, was he disobedient?
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:22.480]   Yes, there were moments where he got himself into trouble.
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.040]   But was he rebellious?
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:27.200]   Never, never from that point forward.
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:29.280]   Two years later, here comes Michael.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:30.680]   - He didn't learn from his older brother, obviously.
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:32.120]   - No, he did not.
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:34.320]   And off he went into high school
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:37.480]   without mopping the administrator there.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.840]   And he did the exact same thing,
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:42.320]   came home and defied me,
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:45.560]   absolutely out and out defied me.
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:49.840]   And Mario got the phone call again and he said, "Okay."
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.320]   - Deja vu, deja vu.
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:55.520]   - And Michael got a chastisement, age 14.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:58.440]   And that was the last chastisement he ever had.
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.800]   And he never rebelled again.
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:04.480]   - Well, that answers your question.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:08.320]   - Yeah, okay, well, that was pretty clear.
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:09.160]   I appreciate it.
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:10.800]   - Yeah, I would never have guessed
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:13.000]   that we would have to do that at 14,
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.840]   but I'm glad we did.
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:17.200]   'Cause if we hadn't have,
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:19.400]   I know there would have been more rebellion.
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:22.640]   - Okay.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:25.840]   - All right. - Any other questions?
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.440]   - We have time for one more.
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:32.560]   - I have a quick question on that topic.
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:36.400]   Oh, sorry, I don't know if I didn't put my hand up.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:40.440]   You said Mario administers that chastisement,
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.800]   obviously you being a mom, a woman with your son,
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:45.920]   is there a point, is it kind of puberty?
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:49.440]   I mean, we're having a son, so I'm questioning that point.
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:52.400]   - When they go through that change,
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:55.760]   there's a point where Mario was no longer spanking Natalie
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.920]   and I was no longer spanking the boy.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:58.760]   - Absolutely.
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:01.400]   - Yeah, it's just, you'll feel it, it's inappropriate.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:04.400]   You just, you feel like it's not right.
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.120]   - Okay, okay, yeah.
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:06.960]   - All right, good.
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:08.000]   - Yeah.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.000]   - Okay, well, we have come to the end of our session, Q&A.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:16.960]   Look forward to seeing everybody next week.
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:18.440]   - Yeah, this was good, guys.
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.280]   - Yeah.
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.800]   - Love that you were all engaged.
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:22.120]   - Good questions.
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:23.760]   - That's good.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.040]   All right, well, I hope that next week's homework
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.920]   is encouraging to you.
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:32.200]   - Zero to six, I mean, six to 12, yeah.
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.040]   Sorry.
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:37.160]   - Yeah, there's gonna be a lot more good stuff, so.
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:40.200]   All right, well, you guys have a great week.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:44.280]   If you need anything, you know how to get a hold of us
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:47.040]   and we will see you then, all right?
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:48.920]   - God bless you guys. - God bless you guys.
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.040]   - Have a good week.
