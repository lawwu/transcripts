[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.840]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.480]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.480]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.040]   My guest today is Dr. Shana Swan.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.120]   Dr. Shana Swan is a professor of environmental medicine
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.800]   and public health at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.840]   She is a world expert in how exposure to various toxins
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.360]   and compounds in the food and environment
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.680]   impact our reproductive health.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.520]   She focuses on how these compounds in our air,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.080]   in our food supply, in our water supply, in cosmetics,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.760]   even in household items,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.900]   impact the developing fetus, children, and adults
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.380]   at the level of their reproductive biology,
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.640]   so things like testosterone and estrogen,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.660]   and the pathways within the brain and body
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.680]   that are impacted by testosterone and estrogen,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.320]   but also how all of those things in our environment
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.000]   and that we put into our body
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.920]   impact our health on a daily basis and our long-term health.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.080]   So during today's discussion,
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.120]   you will learn why fertility rates
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.320]   are indeed dramatically dropping from year to year
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.960]   and have been for quite some time now.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.680]   You'll also learn why testosterone levels are dropping,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.400]   why sperm counts are dropping,
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.820]   why things like polycystic ovarian syndrome
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.280]   are increasing in women, and what we can do about it.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.480]   In fact, during much of today's discussion,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.200]   Dr. Swan emphasizes the things
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.800]   that you can do every single day,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.180]   and that, in fact, turned out to be very simple.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.840]   They involve certain things to do
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.960]   and certain things to avoid
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.980]   in order to limit your exposure
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.980]   to these environmental toxins and their impact.
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.920]   So by the end of today's episode,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.800]   you will be highly informed by the world expert
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   on endocrine disruptors and environmental toxins,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.880]   and you will also be highly informed
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.800]   in terms of how you can have agency,
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.480]   how you can take control of your health
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.680]   in relation to these various compounds.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.580]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.920]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.700]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.840]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.800]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.840]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.320]   to the general public.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.400]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.240]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.040]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.540]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.240]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.480]   That means the electrolytes,
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.520]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.860]   in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.920]   We should all know that proper hydration is critical
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.880]   for optimal brain and body function.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.020]   In fact, even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.440]   can diminish your cognitive and physical performance
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.840]   to a considerable degree.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.760]   It's also important that you're not just hydrated,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.820]   but that you get adequate amounts of electrolytes
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.120]   in the right ratios.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.480]   Drinking a packet of Element dissolved in water
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.840]   makes it very easy to ensure
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.160]   that you're getting adequate amounts
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.200]   of hydration and electrolytes.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.480]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of both,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.080]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.040]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.360]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.040]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.180]   I'll also drink a packet of Element dissolved in water
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.620]   during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing,
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.720]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.920]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.800]   There are a bunch of different
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.280]   great tasting flavors of Element.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.920]   And now that we're entering the winter months,
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.820]   at least here in the Northern Hemisphere,
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.000]   Element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.480]   I really like these chocolate flavors,
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.600]   especially the chocolate mint when mixed into hot water.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.080]   And of course, despite being a bit colder outside,
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.700]   hydration is still critically important.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.280]   In fact, a lot of people don't realize this,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.440]   but even when it's cold out, it's easy to get dehydrated.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.440]   And that's because the air is dry.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.600]   And so even though you don't notice
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.480]   the accumulation of sweat on your skin,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.980]   you can still be losing a lot of water and electrolytes.
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.160]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.320]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.840]   to claim an Element sample pack
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.080]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.820]   Again, that's drink element spelled L-M-N-T.
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.840]   So it's drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.640]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.760]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.360]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.160]   I've been wearing Roka readers and sunglasses for years now,
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.240]   and I love them.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.360]   They're lightweight, they have superb optics,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.280]   and they have lots of frames to choose from.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   I'm excited to share that Roka and I have teamed up
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.380]   to create a new style of red lens glasses.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.880]   These red lens glasses are meant to be worn in the evening
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.360]   after the sun goes down.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.080]   They filter out short wavelength light
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.480]   that comes from screens and from LED lights,
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.960]   the sorts of LED lights that are most commonly used
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.840]   as overhead and frankly, lamp lighting nowadays.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.240]   And I wanna emphasize Roka red lens glasses
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.120]   are not traditional blue blockers.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.280]   They're not designed to be worn during the day
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.000]   and to filter out blue light from screen light.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.800]   They're designed to prevent the full range of wavelengths
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.960]   that suppress melatonin secretion at night,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.600]   and that can alter your sleep.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.060]   So by wearing Roka red lens glasses,
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.660]   they help you calm down
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.880]   and they improve your transition to sleep.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.900]   Most nights I stay up until about 10 p.m. or even midnight,
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.600]   and I wake up between five and 7 a.m.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.480]   depending on when I went to sleep.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.520]   Now I put my Roka red lens glasses on
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.400]   as soon as it gets dark outside,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.080]   and I've noticed a much easier transition to sleep,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.820]   which makes sense based on everything we know
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.200]   about how filtering out short wavelength of light
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.480]   can allow your brain to function correctly.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.060]   Roka red lens glasses also look cool, frankly.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.080]   You can wear them out to dinner or to concerts
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.960]   or out with friends.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.680]   So it turns out it is indeed possible
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.360]   to support your biology, to be scientific about it,
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.840]   and to remain social after all.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.520]   If you'd like to try Roka, go to roka.com.

[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.200]   Again, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.680]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.840]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.560]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.720]   with a licensed therapist
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.020]   carried out entirely online.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.680]   Now, I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.640]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.200]   just as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.080]   including cardiovascular exercise
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.040]   and resistance training exercise,
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.120]   which of course I also do every week.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.480]   Now, there are essentially three things
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.800]   that great therapy provides.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.140]   First, it provides a good rapport with somebody
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.080]   that you can really trust and talk to
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.280]   about any and all issues that concern you.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.680]   Second of all, great therapy provides support
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.360]   in the form of emotional support,
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.800]   but also directed guidance, the dos and the not to dos.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.760]   And third, expert therapy can help you arrive
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.680]   at useful insights that you would not
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.160]   have arrived at otherwise.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.720]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.960]   to find an expert therapist
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.560]   with whom you can really resonate with
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.080]   and provide you with these three benefits that I described.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.160]   Also, because BetterHelp is carried out entirely online,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.240]   it's very time efficient and easy to fit
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.280]   into a busy schedule with no commuting
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.320]   to a therapist's office or sitting in a waiting room
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.140]   or looking for a parking spot.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.780]   So if you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.160]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.280]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.760]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.300]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Shauna Swan.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.640]   Dr. Shauna Swan, welcome.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.180]   - Dr. Andrew Huberman, thank you.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.560]   - I'm super excited for today's conversation.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.160]   I've followed your work for a number of years.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.240]   I've seen some of your appearances on other podcasts
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.980]   and I got to see you speak
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.220]   while we were both in Copenhagen.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.820]   I was in the audience, you didn't know I was there,
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.340]   but incredible stuff that you've been doing
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.160]   as a researcher, as a public educator, as a writer.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.280]   Let's kick off by just asking the basic question.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:27.380]   Are there things in our environment, including our food,
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.020]   that are diminishing our reproductive and overall health?
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.560]   And if so, which are the ones that you think about?
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.280]   And perhaps if you could just mention
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.440]   a few of the more salient, maybe even shocking,
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.240]   but salient results that you've observed over the years.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.240]   Like what was the kind of like, whoa, result or results
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.120]   that have really steered your attention
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.980]   in the last couple of decades?
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.840]   And I'll just say what we were talking about
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.120]   before we were on the microphone,
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.440]   which is that you are a skeptic.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.920]   You are not somebody who walks out into the world
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.420]   and looks for things that could be messing up our biology,
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.240]   messing up our health, and yet you've found some.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.800]   So if you could just share with us what you've observed
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.000]   and what you find really compelling and important
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   for people to know about, we can dive in there.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   - That was a lot of questions.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.080]   I could probably talk for a long time.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.000]   - Feel free, I won't speak until you're done.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.400]   - No, but I want to break it up, let's break it up.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.860]   So I think the first question about was,
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.860]   are there forces, chemicals, agents in the environment
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.020]   that can affect our reproductive health, yes?
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.420]   Okay, so my answer to that is yes.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.800]   I think there's no question about that.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   The question comes down to when and in whom
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.620]   and what dose and so on and so forth.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.620]   But whether there are, let's just say broadly, things,
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.680]   yes, of course.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:00.060]   The category that I focus on are man-made,
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.500]   primarily man-made chemicals.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.500]   Although I do also include the influence of other factors,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.580]   factors of choice, for example, sleep, exercise,
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.100]   that kind of thing, we can talk about that.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.940]   But let's just focus here on the chemicals
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.260]   'cause I think that's what led me to do a lot of my research
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.980]   and to write the book that I wrote.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.980]   And so my thesis is that chemicals in the environment,
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.140]   that's a very broad class,
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.340]   so we'll have to say some chemicals in the environment
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.340]   at the right time to the right organism affect fertility.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.500]   Okay, so, and let me just say fertility
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.900]   is one area that I focused on,
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.320]   but actually this class of chemicals
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.180]   that I'm primarily interested in
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.500]   are those that affect the body's hormones.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.140]   So those are known as hormone-disrupting chemicals
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.560]   or endocrine-disrupting chemicals,
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.300]   hormone-altering chemicals, whatever.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.540]   You know, there's a lot of names.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.540]   But that helps you focus on where to look for the effects.
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.380]   'Cause if it's hormone-altering,
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.340]   you can now have something to really ask.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.880]   Okay, here's a chemical, does it affect a hormone?
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.900]   Which hormone, when, how?
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.860]   And then you start, that's almost, you know,
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.780]   laying out an experiment right there, right?
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.140]   So focusing in on hormone-disrupting chemicals
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.860]   I think is useful.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.100]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.940]   And I think much of what we'll talk about today
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.060]   probably centers on the estrogen and testosterone pathways
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.060]   as they relate to masculinization or feminization
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.020]   of the brain and body and sperm and egg quality.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.940]   - So I'm a reproductive epidemiologist.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.900]   I got there in an indirect path.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.900]   I think probably my work on oral contraceptives
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.500]   led me there most directly.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.860]   And oral contraceptives
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.200]   are endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.620]   - That's what they're designed to do.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.940]   - Right, that's what they're designed to do,
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.300]   change your body's hormones, your reproductive hormones.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.940]   So it's interesting, you know, way back when,
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.880]   when I worked on the study at Kaiser on oral contraceptives,
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.540]   which was the largest study of its kind in the world,
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.820]   actually, trying to figure out,
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.240]   were there adverse effects of oral contraceptives?
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.860]   If so, you know, for whom and when and how much and so on.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.540]   And so that was a very great study.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.100]   And coming forward in time,
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.260]   I, you know, I studied environmental chemicals,
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.260]   not so much pharmaceuticals for quite a while
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.680]   when I was at the California Department of Health Services.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.920]   And then I had an aha moment.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:05.840]   I was flying to Japan with my friend, John Brock,
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.820]   who's a chemist at CDC, wonderful chemist.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.640]   And, you know, had long flights,
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.480]   we were talking about this and that.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.660]   And he says, "Shawna, you should look at phthalates."
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.540]   And I'm going, "Why should I look at phthalates?
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.220]   I never heard of phthalates," right?
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.740]   And he said, "Well, we can now measure them at the CDC,
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.600]   and we see they're in everybody.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.940]   They're in women of reproductive age, fact one.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.940]   Fact two, colleagues at the NTP have shown
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.080]   something they are calling the phthalate syndrome."
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.600]   And so he explained.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.000]   - What is NTP?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.800]   - National Toxicology Program, sorry.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.640]   - Thank you.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.800]   - For using alphabet.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.440]   - No, it's quite all right.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.200]   - National Toxicology Program,
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.280]   a governmental, you know, research center.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.880]   And their job is to look at chemicals
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.280]   and see what is the toxicity.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.800]   So it could be reproductive, it could be carcinogenicity,
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.120]   it could be neurotoxicity, that's what they do.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:11.120]   And so they had signaled out these phthalates
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.320]   as being reproductively toxic, and specifically to males,
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.840]   and specifically when exposure is in utero.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.080]   - Pregnant mom is exposed to phthalates,
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.680]   and somehow the fetus is disrupted.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.520]   - Yes.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.320]   - If you don't mind, I'd like to know,
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.480]   is mom ingesting phthalates in the form of food?
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.120]   Is she inhaling phthalates?
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.720]   Are they landing on her skin?
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.840]   What are the modes of entry into the body of the mom
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.200]   that, let's just assume it goes through the placental barrier
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.680]   into the fetus and is impacting fetal development?
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.520]   - Right.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.960]   So in those experiments, it was through food,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.640]   but we are exposed in all those ways you mentioned.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.520]   Every way that something can get into our body,
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.600]   phthalates get in there.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.560]   But let's come back to that.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.520]   Let me go to the experiment at NTP.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.800]   So what they did at NTP, National Toxicology Program,
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.440]   they fed mother rats various doses
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.520]   of these various phthalates.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.520]   And what they found was no changes in the females
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.240]   or not that they found at that time.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.240]   - The female offspring?
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.560]   - Female offspring, sorry.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.400]   But in the male offspring,
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.780]   they found that the genitals were,
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.720]   I summarize it by saying incompletely masculinized.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.400]   So I'll explain what that is.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.240]   So for that, I have to back up and say
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.020]   something you probably know very well,
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.440]   but I'll just explain it.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.400]   The genital tract initially is a ridge.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.600]   It's a single ridge.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.400]   It's the same in males and females.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.920]   It's not sexually dimorphic at the beginning.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.280]   And then under the influence of testosterone,
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.040]   in a very specific window
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.320]   called the male programming window,
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.960]   in rats it stays, I think, nine to 12 of gestation.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.240]   So a very short window.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.960]   - To orient people, I think rat-mouse gestation
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.600]   is about 21 days or so?
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.680]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.960]   - So for us, it'll be early first trimester.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.280]   But that comes later.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.280]   So at that time, if they feed their mother
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.600]   that chemical in her food,
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.520]   then her male offspring are born
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.960]   with changes in his genitals,
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.520]   or more likely to, right?
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.080]   And so what they tend to have is a smaller penis,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.000]   less descent of the testes,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.280]   more likely to have undescended testicles.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.880]   There are internal changes of it.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.960]   We didn't get into in our human study
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.760]   because we can't look there,
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.640]   but the epididymis, there are changes and so on.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.040]   The whole genital tract is altered.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.920]   And the most important measure for me, as it turned out,
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.560]   and for humans, and perhaps for animals,
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.400]   is something that the scientists,
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.800]   animal scientists had studied for a long time,
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.720]   for actually 90 plus years,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.560]   but had never been studied in humans.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.520]   And that is the distance from the anus to the genitals.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.520]   This collection of changes in the male genitals
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.840]   was given the name, the phthalate syndrome.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.800]   Now, you're a physician and you,
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.320]   I challenge you to think of any syndrome,
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.120]   aside from alcohol, you know,
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.440]   there, fetal alcohol syndrome, of course,
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.640]   there's a syndrome,
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.640]   but note what syndrome is attached to a chemical class.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.880]   - Just for technical purposes,
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.360]   I'm a PhD, not a clinician,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.920]   but I worked on neural development for many years,
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.040]   and then prior to that, some endocrine stuff,
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.640]   so I'm facile with the general terms.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:00.000]   One that comes to mind would be, for instance,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.160]   the thalidomide babies, right?
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.360]   A miscarriage, anti-miscarriage drug
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.200]   that changed limb development.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.560]   That's a very extreme example.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.560]   I would say for, in human normal development,
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.040]   what I'm most familiar with
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.880]   are the early organizing effects of androgens
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.600]   that convert to estrogen on external phenotype,
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.160]   which is basically nerd speak for,
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.640]   during development, the Y chromosome produces,
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.560]   it leads to the production of a number of genes
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.880]   and eventually proteins through RNA, et cetera,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.880]   that are including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.360]   that in the brain organizes the brain male
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.880]   and causes the growth of the penis
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.320]   or organizes, meaning it sets up the penis
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.480]   to then, during puberty,
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.680]   when the penis is exposed to testosterone
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.240]   and estrogen and DHT, it's a bunch of things,
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.160]   not just testosterone, the penis grows.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.360]   So that- - And lots of other things.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.640]   - Right, lots of other things, right?
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   So the word soup that I just put forward
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.880]   is basically saying that there are a lot of things
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.880]   in development where hormones set up a potential
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.080]   to respond to other hormones later.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.880]   It's not that testosterone grows the penis
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.960]   during development, it does that,
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.040]   but more so it establishes a potential
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.960]   for the penis to grow when exposed
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.240]   to things later during puberty.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.480]   Do I have that right? - Right, right.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.920]   As far as the name goes, which is the phthalate syndrome,
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.400]   there is thalidomide.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.920]   It's not usually called the thalidomide syndrome,
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.800]   but it could be, so you're right about that,
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.520]   but it's extremely rare.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.480]   And there's no environmentally, you know,
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.160]   chemical in the environment as opposed to a pharmaceutical
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.680]   that is given a syndrome.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.480]   So this is very, very unique.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.360]   And so I thought, wow, John's telling me
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.960]   this on the plane, right? (laughs)
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.800]   - Something in the environment that is basically
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.720]   having an endocrine and body disruptive effect,
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.600]   at least on par with fetal alcohol syndrome
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.960]   and thalidomide syndrome. - Right, exactly.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.800]   Right. - Yeah.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.560]   So when, well, at this point it was only animals, right?
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.320]   'Cause John was telling me about the NTP study,
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.680]   which was in rats.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:23.680]   And so I thought, wow, you know, I like puzzles.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.920]   So my first question was, is this happening in humans?
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.360]   You might ask that, you know,
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.440]   as a natural thing to ask. - Great question.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.000]   - And then I thought, how would we find out?
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:42.120]   And answering that question took me 10 years, okay?
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.800]   And so if you think about, okay, phthalate in the mother,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:54.760]   changes in the genitals of the offspring, connect them.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.520]   How do we do that, right?
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.640]   So we have to start with phthalates in the mother.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.360]   How do we know that?
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.120]   Well, fortunately or not, (laughs)
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:10.120]   I had stored a lot of urine from pregnant women
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.720]   from a study that I was doing on sperm count.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.840]   I just got the women's urine coincidentally, if you will.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.520]   I thought, well, save it.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.760]   You know, it's not expensive and not hard.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.360]   Minus 80 degree freezers, doesn't take a lot of room.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.200]   Put it in there.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.140]   So I had this urine saved from pregnant women.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.440]   And then I knew from John that we could look in the urine
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.160]   for phthalate metabolites.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.160]   So these are products that the body forms
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.000]   when they're exposed to phthalates
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.240]   and you can measure them in urine.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.500]   So I thought, okay, I could get that urine.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.560]   I could look at the phthalate metabolites
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.100]   and then I'd know what the mother was exposed to.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:58.080]   And based on the animal data, we have good evidence
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.100]   that it actually makes its way to the fetus.
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.960]   So then I thought, okay,
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.040]   then maybe there's a change in the babies.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.360]   So then I had to get the babies.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   So fortunately, I had done this study on pregnant couples,
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.080]   pregnant women and their partners,
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.280]   and I was able to call them and say,
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.700]   would you come in and let us measure your baby's genitals?
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.200]   Right?
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.440]   - How willing were parents to let you do that?
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.280]   It seems--
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.100]   - They were okay.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.940]   Most of them were okay with that.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.880]   - Were they? - Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.000]   Well, they trusted us.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   They had been in a study with us and we were reputable.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.960]   - Those babies were still--
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.800]   - Young, but not newborns.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.000]   So this was a while later.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.420]   The babies that we actually got were on average,
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.640]   I think about a month, 12 months old.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.640]   So not ideal maybe because the rats
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.000]   had been measured at birth.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.840]   The rat genitals had been,
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.480]   but that's what we could do at that time.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.360]   - Yeah, the reason I ask is there's always the potential
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.200]   for ongoing phthalate exposure to the newborn.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.280]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.780]   - But I suppose in either case,
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:09.360]   you're able to draw some potential link between,
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.800]   or potentially draw a link,
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   I have to be careful with my language there,
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.820]   between phthalate exposure in utero and ex utero
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.480]   and these external biomarkers.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.200]   - I mean, given that the critical window
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.560]   is quite short and quite early,
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.480]   by the way, let me just say when the rats,
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.320]   they did a lot of work on this critical window.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.220]   And when the rat moms were exposed before day nine,
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.280]   it did nothing.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.320]   And when they were exposed after day 12, it did nothing.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.520]   So it was only the exposure during,
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.440]   that critical window is very delicate.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.460]   And it's by the way, true of the brain as well.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.760]   So teasing out what is the critical window
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.540]   is one of the challenges that we have
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.160]   when we work with these chemicals.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.600]   So I wasn't so much worried about exposure
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.720]   in the delivery room and in their feed
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.080]   as in the first year of life,
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.240]   because I knew that was unlikely to change these measures.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.160]   Do other things, but maybe, but not these measures.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.680]   So then the question became kind of what you were asking
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.080]   is what do we measure?
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.600]   What do we actually measure?
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.440]   And if you think about a newborn rat or mouse,
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.960]   their genitals are pretty small.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.800]   And there's not, there isn't,
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.280]   it's very difficult to know exactly how that corresponds
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.280]   to the human genital system and what you see at birth,
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.580]   you know, when you spread a boy's legs, right?
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.840]   And so I got a pediatrician in Los Angeles
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.920]   who worked with me on how to make that translation
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.640]   and how to do this exam.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.660]   And that took us quite a while
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.180]   because we really wanted to come as close as we could.
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.240]   What was clear was that the anus part of it was easy.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.920]   You go to the center of the anus.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.960]   So that was easy.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.120]   Then what's the other landmark?
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.680]   What's the genital landmark?
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   So it turns out there are in males too,
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.800]   and in females there are too as well.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.300]   So, but let's just talk about males.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.100]   So for males, the best place to measure
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.040]   and actually closest to the rat measurement
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.000]   is the place where the tissue changes,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.600]   where the scrotum inserts.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.400]   And that, it goes from rugator to smooth tissue.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.300]   And that point is pretty clear, pretty easy to measure.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.080]   The other measure, and that was the inner scrotal distance.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.860]   And the other measurement we took
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.280]   was the anal-penile distance.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.040]   And that was the insertion,
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.240]   the anterior insertion of the penis.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.500]   - The part closest to the body.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.080]   - Closest to the head, yeah.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.920]   - Closest to the head.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   - Yeah, and that was not so obvious
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.760]   because you don't have a change in tissue there.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.580]   So where exactly do you put your caliper?
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:56.580]   And we had a lot of discussion about, do you press down?
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:02.360]   Do you, you know, where exactly do you make that mark?
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.600]   And actually the inner scrotal is the measurement
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.680]   with the least variance
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.960]   because you can measure most precisely.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.640]   But the anal-penile is another measurement.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.660]   And then you can do something similar in females,
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.640]   and we did that, but that's,
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.720]   we maybe don't have to go into that now.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.360]   So we designed this exam and we did a lot of work
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.040]   to make sure it was repeatable across examiners.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.520]   And what we finally did was bring the mothers in,
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.520]   bring the babies in, and got three measurements.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.860]   And then on every 10th baby,
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.880]   we got an independent examiner to get three measurements.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.020]   So we could look at within and between examiner variation.
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.100]   You understand this is the first time
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.220]   this had been done this way in humans.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.780]   There was a Mexican study that tried to do this,
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.340]   and I never learned very much about it.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.620]   And I was excited that they had done this,
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.500]   but I'm not sure how it relates to this.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.460]   So I've just mentioned that out of honesty.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.680]   You know, there's somebody in Mexico did this,
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.140]   but to my knowledge, this is the first time
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.100]   it was used as a toxicological measure in humans.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.720]   Right, so we did that study.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.880]   We related those measurements to what CDC had measured
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.480]   in the urine of our women,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.240]   collected while they were pregnant,
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.920]   and we found the phthalate syndrome.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.480]   - Could you explain what the correlation was
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.920]   between phthalate metabolite levels, which is I believe-
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.040]   - Not by number, 'cause I don't remember it anymore,
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.220]   but there was a significant, let's just take the AGD.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.700]   The AGD of mothers who had higher levels
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.620]   of three, the most antiandrogenic phthalates,
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.420]   I'll tell you what those are in a minute,
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.900]   had significantly shorter anogenital distance.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.260]   And then I have to say that,
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.420]   which I haven't said and should have,
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.900]   that anogenital distance is sexually dimorphic.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.840]   So it tends to be 50 to 100% longer in males than females.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.260]   That makes sense if you think about
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.060]   what's going in that space.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.680]   There's a lot of real estate in males
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.920]   between the anus and let's say the penis,
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.000]   penile insertion, much more than in females.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.720]   So it's natural that that will be longer,
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   but I began doing some work looking at other species
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.760]   and it turns out that that's true
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.720]   in all mammalian species except two.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.520]   And one is the hyena and one is the elephant.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.680]   So in the hyena, I'm just saying this
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.080]   'cause you're being amused by it, you know about hyenas?
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.040]   - I do, I know more about hyena genitalia
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.520]   than I'd like to admit.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.120]   And I can tell you why after you educate us,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.660]   but I'll keep my explanation brief,
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.760]   but I'm very familiar with hyena genitalia.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.760]   - So I know Stephen Glickman who works with,
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.920]   you might know him too, he works in Berkeley.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.800]   - He was my instructor when I was a graduate student at Cal
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.840]   and I used to run in Tilden Park,
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.760]   I suppose I'll tell it now.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.440]   And there was a colony of wild hyenas,
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.800]   but they were behind chain link.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.520]   It's actually a favorite hike of mine
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.400]   up the Strawberry Canyon trail.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.080]   And a good friend of mine, Brian Prendergast,
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.920]   who's now a professor at the University of Chicago,
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.200]   worked on the prairie voles
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.680]   that were also housed at that facility.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.320]   And a fun thing to do was to go see the hyenas with Steve.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:47.060]   They're brutally dangerous animals.
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.960]   And Steve has tons of stories about them.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.360]   We should probably resist our temptation
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.240]   to spiral into that.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.520]   Maybe sometime I'll do a little like evening chat podcast
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.260]   where I tell Steve Glickman stories,
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.440]   he's a delightful person.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.600]   And yeah, those, let's just say this,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.160]   the female hyenas have clitorises larger
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.760]   than some of the male hyena penises,
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.600]   and those females give birth through those clitorises,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.440]   as we both know.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.960]   - So you will not be surprised to know
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.300]   that the female HD is longer than the male.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.200]   - Right, 'cause they're heavily androgenized.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.040]   - Exactly.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.440]   - As I recall by androstenedione.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.440]   - Actually, I don't know that.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.760]   - It became popular during the era of steroids
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.420]   in professional baseball because androstenedione
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:37.420]   was being used pretty frequently in baseball at that time.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.240]   Anyway, we have to be, we could go down the spiral of-
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.960]   But also in terms of behavior, the female is the alpha.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.800]   - Right.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.640]   - Right.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.460]   - They eat first.
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.300]   - Yes.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.480]   - They're physically and hierarchically dominant
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.320]   in hyenas.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.060]   - So it's really interesting, isn't it?
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.780]   That they would have a longer, more masculine
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.280]   intergenital distance.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.760]   Elephants, we won't go into now,
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.540]   but they're kind of midway in many things.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.260]   So including, they're about equal intergenital distance
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.540]   in males and females.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:15.640]   Other than that, humans and other species,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.880]   male intergenital distance is 50 to 100% longer.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.880]   However, so three phthalates, diethylhexyl phthalate, DEHP,
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:30.300]   dibutyl phthalate, DBP, and butylbenzyl phthalate, BBZP,
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:36.860]   are the most antiandrogenic testosterone-lowering phthalates.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.860]   And those are the ones that were associated
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.340]   with a shorter intergenital distance in males.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.660]   - In human males.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.060]   - Human males and animal.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.980]   So we replicated that animal study in humans.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.100]   And then, because you know this is how it is in science,
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.740]   I had to do it all again, right?
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.220]   So I started a whole new study,
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:07.100]   and that study is still going on.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.060]   The children are still being followed.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.900]   I think we started in 2012.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:18.660]   The first paper on intergenital distance came out in 2005,
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.360]   had a pretty big impact.
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.080]   - So these are studies where you're looking
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.080]   at the intergenital distance in relatively newborn humans,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.680]   then tracking that distance.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.080]   - No, that's a different, tracking is another study.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.760]   This is just two studies
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.760]   on demonstrating the Thaller syndrome in human males.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.560]   So the first one I described,
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.120]   the second one the replication,
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.720]   and the second one is the one that's going on still.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:52.100]   So, and what it does to their reproductive function,
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.980]   we don't know, the kids are only 12 years old now.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.060]   So we would like to know that, and we will know that.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.420]   Okay, but I have another answer for you about that.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.740]   So we started the second study,
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.660]   and the second study, which is called TIDES,
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.220]   which is the Infant Development Environment Study.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.820]   By the way, these are both in four cities
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.000]   in the United States.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.680]   And there we did it right.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:23.200]   So we got the urine in the first, early urine,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.480]   'cause we knew that could be important.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.560]   We didn't have that option in the first one.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.760]   Remember, those urine samples were accidental.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.640]   We got them when we could, right?
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.700]   And we got repeated urines, one in each trimester,
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.600]   to look at the effects in different trimesters.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.140]   And then we examined the babies at birth,
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.040]   which is what the rats,
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.780]   so we came much closer to replicating the rodent study.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.260]   And we saw it again.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.600]   - I'd like to take a quick break,
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.820]   and thank our sponsor, AG1.
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.900]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral,
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.580]   probiotic drink with adaptogens.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.460]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.940]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.660]   The reason I started taking AG1,
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.340]   and the reason I still take AG1,
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.140]   once and often twice a day,
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.660]   is because it is the highest quality
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.580]   and most complete foundational nutritional supplement.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.580]   What that means is that AG1 ensures
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.820]   that you're getting all the necessary vitamins,
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.680]   minerals, and other micronutrients
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.380]   to form a strong foundation for your daily health.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.020]   AG1 also has probiotics and prebiotics
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.940]   that support a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.980]   Your gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.660]   that line your digestive tract
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.180]   and impact things such as your immune system status,
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.160]   your metabolic health, your hormone health, and much more.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.180]   So I've consistently found that when I take AG1 daily,
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.360]   my digestion is improved, my immune system is more robust,
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.540]   I rarely get sick,
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.300]   and my mood and mental focus are at their best.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.500]   In fact, if I could take just one supplement,
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.740]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.140]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.340]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.580]   For this month only, November 2024,
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.060]   AG1 is giving away one free month's supply
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.540]   of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.600]   in addition to the usual welcome kit
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.900]   of five free travel packs
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.240]   and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2 with your order.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.820]   Omega-3 fatty acids are critical for brain health,
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.940]   mood, cognition, and much more.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.380]   Again, go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.460]   - More phthalate exposure equates
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:27.620]   to shorter anal genital distance in males.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.380]   It was approaching the distribution in females.
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.460]   It sounds like the distributions
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.660]   moved more closely together.
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.460]   - Yes, yes. - Right.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.180]   - Although it wasn't the females that moved.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.180]   - Sorry, the male distribution-
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:42.260]   - Became more like the female.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.100]   - Became more- - Right, feminized.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.340]   - I could say feminized, but more female-like in its-
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.280]   - And they, but these boys also had smaller penises,
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.580]   less descent of the testes, smaller scrotums.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.380]   So they were smaller, you know,
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.340]   everything was in their genital areas.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.420]   - All the secondary sex characteristics
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.500]   of puberty in males, Adam's apple, facial hair growth,
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.580]   thickening of the vocal cords,
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.540]   therefore lowering the voice, et cetera,
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:11.060]   are those all later activating effects of hormones
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.820]   or are there precursors to those that are present in males?
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.540]   Because in mice, as I recall,
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:23.700]   like I couldn't tell you,
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.160]   like we call it in the laboratory,
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.060]   people always chuckle at this,
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.420]   but it's like sexing the animals when you, you know,
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.020]   look to determine if it's a male or female.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.340]   When they're really young,
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.820]   you have to like look carefully at first, right?
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.020]   And then you get pretty good at it.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.700]   As they get older, it gets easier.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.220]   But when the mice are, you know,
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.220]   feet down, back up, you know,
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.660]   you can't really, you can't really tell.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.500]   You can't really tell.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.340]   As the mice get older,
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.940]   their testicles become visible in the males from,
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.260]   even from above.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.900]   But, you know, as far as I know,
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.260]   there aren't really external markers.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.940]   So you may have found the one truly external biomarker
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.060]   of maleness.
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:06.100]   And, and so I do want to say one thing about females,
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.240]   'cause then that'll lead me to my conclusion
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.420]   about the role of this measure.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:16.340]   So if the mother is exposed
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.720]   to more testosterone than expected,
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:25.380]   you might expect that her female offspring
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.900]   would have a more male in a genital distance.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.820]   - Is that the case?
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.820]   - Yes.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.940]   - So it's a bi-directional effect.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:31.820]   - Yes.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.820]   - Can we also presume that if the mother either secretes
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.900]   or is exposed to more androgen,
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.620]   then the males can become hyper male?
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:40.460]   - No.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.020]   We'd never, I don't know what that would be.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.780]   We never saw anything that would be hyper male.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:51.220]   So the yes I said to you was the result of a study
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:56.620]   where we looked at the girls born to women with PCOS.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.780]   So women with PCOS, as you know,
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.420]   have excess testosterone.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.900]   - Polycystic ovarian syndrome.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.340]   We've talked about it a little bit before in the podcast.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.420]   It's associated with, my understanding is it's associated
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.780]   with elevated levels of androgens.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.700]   - That's right.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.260]   And these women often have facial hair and you know.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.620]   - Not just the moms, but the people,
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:24.460]   the women with PCOS have elevated androgens.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.300]   - Yes.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.260]   - Not just, we're not talking about pregnant moms.
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.100]   - Exactly.
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.380]   And so in our study, Population,
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.140]   we did a search for women who had diagnosis of PCOS
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.380]   and took that as a marker of higher testosterone exposure
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.740]   and then looked at the girls.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.940]   And yes, those girls had a longer quote,
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.180]   more masculine intergenital distance.
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.980]   - What age group were you looking at?
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.020]   - In the infants, in the infants.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.420]   Oh, the PCOS was at pregnancy.
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.540]   At the time they were pregnant.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.980]   - So presumably people between their like,
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.620]   somewhere in their twenties out to their forties.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:04.460]   - So adult human females who have PCOS tend to,
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.140]   we know they have higher levels of androgens,
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:11.540]   but they also have more male like in a genital distance.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.380]   - They do not, their daughters do.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.380]   - Their daughters do.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.900]   Thank you for that clarification.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.000]   - Their daughters, and so put this together,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.860]   this measure is a look inside the womb.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.020]   At the androgen level that the fetus is exposed to
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.700]   at that time, which is amazing
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.500]   because you can't go in there without disturbing,
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.700]   you know, you can't.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:42.180]   And so this is very early first trimester,
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.840]   you can't even get, you know, fluid and so on.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.300]   So this tells you, this is like a readout
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:53.300]   of what was in, you know, in the fluid at the time.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:58.700]   So then your next question was,
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:03.300]   what does this mean for later fertility?
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.140]   Yes?
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.500]   - Yeah, what is the impact of this early androgen exposure
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:13.500]   to female offspring, or let's just say reduction
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:18.480]   in functional androgen exposure to male offspring?
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.820]   The reason I'm using these, you know, loop-de-loop languages
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.420]   as you probably know, but for the audience,
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.860]   not trying to complicate things here,
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.740]   but a lot of the masculinizing effects of hormones
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.500]   in fetal development is actually testosterone
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.980]   that's converted into estrogen.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.340]   So it can get pretty tricky.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.180]   - Right.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.420]   - And, but maybe for sake of simplicity today,
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:43.620]   we'll just stick with androgen effects on masculinization
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.660]   with the understanding that some of those effects
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.820]   are the consequence of testosterone
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.380]   being converted into estrogen.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.220]   - Right.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.340]   - And that people form such strong associations falsely
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.500]   that, you know, testosterone is male, maleness,
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.720]   and that's not true, and estrogen is femaleness,
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.700]   and they both, and it just gets really murky.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.540]   But for the time being,
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:11.740]   you identified an external biomarker of fetal androgen,
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:16.660]   AKA masculinization via the mother.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.640]   - That's right.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.480]   - Got it.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.320]   - So then we asked the question you've asked,
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.200]   and many people asked, who cares?
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:31.800]   Why would we worry about a boy
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.360]   having a slightly smaller anogenital distance?
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.560]   - Well, I can tell you, there are many boys
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.180]   that are probably worried about it right now.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.020]   - Right, right.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.040]   (both laughing)
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:40.880]   - They've probably got the ruler
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.900]   and the calipers out right now, which is, you know.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.200]   - But I'm gonna answer that question.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.800]   - Right.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.720]   So I told you that our kids are too young.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.280]   They're not producing sperm right now, right?
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:58.000]   So we had to go to an adult population, right?
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.140]   And so we went to a population of college students
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.600]   in Rochester, New York.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:09.600]   And what we did there was make an assumption,
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.840]   which is based on animal data.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.880]   It's true in animals.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.840]   We've been following the animal path here all along.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.360]   So in the animals, my colleague, Earl Gray,
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.880]   who did these studies.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.000]   - His name is Earl Gray?
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.840]   - Yeah.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.660]   - That's cool.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:28.960]   - He said AGD is forever.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.520]   - Anogenital distance is forever.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.700]   - Now what that means is it's not like
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.480]   your anogenital distance today
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.760]   is what it was when you were born.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.400]   Of course, you're a bigger person,
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.320]   but that means adjusted for body size, right?
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.560]   So if you assume that AGD is forever,
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.520]   if you're born with a short for your size AGD,
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.400]   then when you're 20, you'll have a short for your size AGD.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.320]   Okay?
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.360]   Can we assume that?
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.200]   Okay.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.640]   So if we assume that,
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.660]   then if we get these college students to come in
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.920]   and we can measure their anogenital distance,
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.000]   we're getting a reflection
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.400]   of what it was when they were born.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.240]   Okay?
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.440]   And then we can get their sperm count.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.280]   And then we can see if they're related.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.120]   And that's what we did.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.080]   So we got this population of volunteers,
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.440]   paid them $75.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.880]   And one of the guys said,
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.080]   "For 75 bucks, you can do anything."
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.680]   (laughing)
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.760]   And so what we did was
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.320]   we measured their anogenital distance,
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.760]   and then we got them to give a semen sample
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.260]   and complete a questionnaire and things you do in a study.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.320]   - We'll link to that study,
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.400]   but I have a couple of questions
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.240]   about the controls in that study,
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.800]   just for sake of people understanding
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.040]   how a study like this would be done.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.880]   I don't expect you to recall all the details,
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.440]   but you're adjusting for body size and body weight,
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.800]   height, weight.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.960]   What are the factors that would scale here
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.800]   that would allow you to normalize?
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.120]   In other words, what you're trying to do
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.040]   is backtrack to what it likely was at infancy.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.480]   - No, we didn't actually try to go back.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.040]   Let me just tell you what the results were.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.420]   In this group of men,
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.220]   if they had a longer anogenital distance,
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.720]   they had a higher sperm count.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.180]   - Got it, so you were correlating those two measures.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.940]   - Right, and then if we wanted to say something about,
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.060]   we didn't try to say anything
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.380]   about how it was when they were born.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.580]   We just said, "Okay, we'll take that assumption
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.820]   "that this reflects their early AGD."
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:34.100]   If we wanna say something about early AGD and sperm count.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.580]   So it's easy to say AGD is related to sperm count
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.740]   because we measured that, we saw that.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.140]   A correlation, that's published.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.180]   Okay, if we wanna say their early AGD at birth
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.300]   and their sperm count,
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.100]   that's a leap of faith in some sense
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.740]   because we don't have their early.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.220]   For these guys in Rochester,
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.620]   we didn't measure their AGD at birth.
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.140]   - Were there any conditions of being a participant
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.060]   in the study such as refraining from alcohol,
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.280]   cannabis, et cetera, in the 90 days prior,
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.360]   90 days being the duration of a spermatogenesis?
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.280]   - Yeah, I don't remember that.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.160]   - These are college students,
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.680]   so presumably some of them are drinking, okay.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.780]   But in the end, it was a robust link.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.600]   - And then Mike Eisenberg, who you might know at Stanford.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.440]   - Yeah, my colleague at Stanford.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.600]   He's been on this podcast.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.080]   - Yeah, good, good.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.480]   So he's a colleague of mine too.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:29.480]   And he looked at men in a fertility clinic
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.640]   and those who had born children
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.820]   and those who had not born children.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.520]   And the men who had born children
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.840]   had a longer in a general distance
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.580]   than men who had never born a child.
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.080]   - Never born, but were trying.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.400]   - Yes. - Right.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.200]   These were not people who opted out.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.400]   - Right, exactly.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.940]   - These were people who were having challenges
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.960]   with fertility versus success with fertility.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.760]   - And by the way, you know,
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:56.280]   the question of how you measure AGD in an adult man
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.360]   is a different question
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.680]   than how you measure it in a newborn.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.140]   And we did a lot of work on that.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.920]   And Mike will help with that too.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.040]   So it sounds like, oh, and may I ask,
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.640]   were the sperm counts that were on the,
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   let's just say the lower, like the lower quartile,
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.240]   were the quote unquote lower sperm counts
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.720]   like functionally lower?
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.920]   'Cause I always wonder about this.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.120]   Like it's come up in a number of discussions
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.200]   like with Robert Sapolsky, with Mike Eisenberg.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.360]   And now I'm asking you,
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.280]   and when we hear that sperm counts are going down,
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.480]   are they going down to the point
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.720]   where fertility is impacted?
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.360]   That's really one of the, I think, functional questions.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.200]   - So I'm gonna, let's lay aside the question of AGD, right?
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.200]   That's really interesting,
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.000]   but let's talk about sperm count.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.480]   Okay, so there's a beautiful study
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:56.480]   among pregnancy planners out of Denmark
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.680]   quite a long time ago.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.160]   And in that study, what they did was take couples
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:08.480]   that were trying to conceive that had never,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.880]   or not recently, I can't remember,
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.920]   used oral contraceptives.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.080]   And then they saw what the sperm count was
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.480]   and how long it took them to conceive, right?
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.320]   Time to pregnancy in relation to, so.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:25.160]   And what they showed is a really interesting curve,
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.440]   which has never been corrected to my knowledge.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.120]   It's what I use and what I think people use,
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.920]   which is that if you, I wish I could draw it here,
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.360]   I wish I had a black, you should have a board,
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.200]   a whiteboard. (laughs)
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.320]   - The problem is a lot of people are listening,
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.680]   but maybe we can talk people through it.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.680]   - Yeah, yeah. - Sorry.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.160]   - So just think about a curve
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.120]   where you go all the way down to zero,
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.920]   that would be no sperm.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:52.800]   And then as the probability of conceiving is zero,
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.600]   so you're looking at sperm count along the X-axis
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.440]   and months to conception.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:03.680]   And what you see is that if you have no sperm,
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.840]   you don't have no conception.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.400]   If you go up to around 40, 45, there's a steep increase.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.040]   So the more sperm you have-
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.400]   - 40, 45 million?
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.520]   - Million per milliliter.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.960]   - And this is million per milliliter,
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.600]   so just pure concentration, not number of motile sperm.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.000]   This is just how many sperm?
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   We're not talking about quality.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.840]   We're just talking about number.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.680]   - No, no, no, just the number.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.280]   And when you have 45 to 50 million per milliliter
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:31.840]   and below, it matters a lot what your sperm count is.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.440]   I mean, people say it doesn't matter.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.400]   Yeah, if you get in this range
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.880]   where the probability of conception
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.560]   is dropping off really rapidly, it matters a lot.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.520]   And then around 45 to 50, it starts to level off.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.080]   And then after that, certainly after 100, probably 75,
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.680]   it doesn't matter at all.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.680]   - So 100 million sperm per milliliter of semen.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.400]   - Yes.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.720]   So can you see this?
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.200]   Okay, so when people say,
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.960]   "Does sperm count matter for fertility?"
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.840]   Yes, it matters a lot if it's low,
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.600]   and no, it doesn't matter at all if it's high.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.000]   So we just have too many sperm.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.880]   I mean, I don't, but humans, you know.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.520]   - So nature runs a probability game, overproduced sperm.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.600]   - Right.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.840]   - Some of those will be high quality,
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.880]   some will be low quality. - Exactly.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:26.280]   - Depending on their age, that is when they were generated.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.520]   - Or their conditions, you know.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.960]   - Or their conditions, how much heat exposure, et cetera.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.600]   So nature runs a probability game.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.440]   - That's right.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.360]   - Hoping that the best quality sperm
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.160]   will fertilize the egg.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.480]   - Right.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:45.480]   - So below 45,000, excuse me, below 45 million.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.560]   - Million per milliliter.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.320]   - Below 45 million sperm per milliliter of semen,
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.800]   the sperm count really matters.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.360]   It drops off precipitously.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.200]   - That's right.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.480]   - Once you get up to 75, 100 million per milliliter of sperm,
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.840]   then- - It's all good.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.680]   You're good to go.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:04.920]   - Right, and sperm counts range anywhere from,
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.640]   you know, it could be low eight, nine,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.400]   10 million per milliliter in the very low situation.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.240]   - It could be zero.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.560]   - It could be zero in some people, right?
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.080]   All the way up to 400 million.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.160]   There's a huge range.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.000]   - That's right.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.920]   - And that's a function of age,
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.080]   it's a function of genetics,
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.880]   it's a function of presumably phthalate exposure, right?
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.080]   - Yeah.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.440]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:28.120]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.760]   I recently became a Function member
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.040]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.080]   to lab testing.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.980]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:36.960]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.600]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.480]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:44.240]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.520]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.960]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.720]   Function not only provides testing
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.160]   of over a hundred biomarkers
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.820]   key to physical and mental health,
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.680]   but it also analyzes these results
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:01.240]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.080]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.200]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.520]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.320]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.200]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.680]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.360]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.680]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.440]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.800]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.700]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.760]   both of which can support glutathione production
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.520]   and detoxification, and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.080]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.480]   is so important for health.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.280]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:41.200]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.680]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.600]   both at the level of ease of use,
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.080]   that is getting the test done,
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.000]   as well as how comprehensive and how actionable
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.400]   the tests are, that I recently joined their advisory board,
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.640]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.960]   If you'd like to try Function,
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.240]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.840]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.440]   but they're offering early access
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.680]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:08.960]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.160]   to get early access to Function.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.480]   We were on to the fact that sperm counts are dropping.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.560]   There's a relationship to anogenital distance,
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.840]   and there's a relationship between anogenital distance
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.480]   and phthalate exposure.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.720]   And then I asked the question,
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:24.200]   you know, okay, we're hearing about sperm counts dropping,
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.360]   but is it functionally relevant?
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.760]   Is that one of the reasons why fertility is dropping?
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.120]   And we've also got the female side
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.920]   where we've got women with elevated androgens.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.440]   So we can talk about that a little bit later.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.160]   But, and then of course we have the socio,
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:45.160]   the sociobiology piece where people are opting out,
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:49.400]   or it's also economics in some cases,
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.400]   opting out of having kids.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.320]   - Right, so let's go back to sperm count,
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.120]   'cause we haven't really talked about that.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.160]   It's a kind of a different path.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.320]   And my introduction into phthalates
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.920]   was not through sperm count, right?
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.800]   It was through this question of my colleague asking me,
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.520]   you know, you should look at this, I'm challenged.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.360]   And I looked at it,
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.880]   and that was really, really interesting journey
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.080]   that I went on, okay?
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:15.920]   So that, but there was a separate for a while journey
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.040]   that I was on, and that started in the late 1990s
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:24.240]   when I was asked to join a committee
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.280]   of the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:32.520]   And that committee was assembled to look at the question
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:36.600]   of whether hormonally active chemicals,
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.800]   endocrine disrupting chemicals in the environment
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.560]   posed a threat to human health.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.520]   Because at that time, it was like,
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.160]   well, yeah, we hear about this, but should we care, right?
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:53.160]   And so that committee wanted to consider a study
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:58.440]   that had come out of Denmark a few years earlier,
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.080]   which claimed that sperm count
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.000]   had dropped 50% in 50 years.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.480]   - Wow, that's a huge drop.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.320]   - That's what, we're seeing worse than that,
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.800]   by the way, now, so, okay.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.840]   They said to me, I was the only statistician on the panel,
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:18.040]   would you look at this and see if we need to consider this
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.480]   in our deliberations?
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.160]   And as I mentioned, I'm skeptical, and I looked at it,
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.440]   and I thought, eh, I don't think so.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.880]   That was my initial reaction.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:32.080]   And that was because, first of all,
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.840]   I didn't know who had written this.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.800]   I just saw it in a journal, and it was not very big
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.600]   and not very many figures, not very much data.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.240]   And I thought of it, and I thought,
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:47.560]   that's a big claim for a little paper, you know?
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:51.360]   But I'll look at it, 'cause it's important.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:56.360]   And so what I did then was to think about all the factors
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:01.160]   that we epidemiologists call confounders,
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.620]   things that might have caused that decline
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:08.220]   if it wasn't real biologically, right?
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:11.480]   And so we could think of some of them together.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:15.320]   You know, maybe the method of counting sperm had changed
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.340]   so that later methods counted fewer sperm
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:19.640]   in the same sample.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.660]   That's certainly possible, right?
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.600]   But it turned out that wasn't the case,
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.900]   'cause they actually had all used the same method.
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.420]   And maybe the men had changed, so maybe there's,
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.460]   you can't get a sperm count at random.
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.020]   You have to get somebody to volunteer, right?
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.100]   So who were these men?
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.940]   Were they very different, you know,
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.140]   in the early part of the study,
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.080]   in the late part of the study,
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.500]   in a way that maybe in the late part of the study,
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.780]   there were men with lower sperm count,
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.740]   and they were more concerned, you know?
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:51.460]   Maybe they were more obese.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:52.620]   That's pretty plausible.
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:56.680]   Obesity is related to sperm count, fertility.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.060]   And maybe they smoked more, and maybe,
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.660]   and so on and so forth, right?
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:06.660]   So what I did was to get the 61 studies,
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.820]   go through them, and try to extract information
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.960]   on all the factors that could explain the decline.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:19.760]   So I created a multivariable model and ran that model.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:25.980]   And to my astonishment, when I was done,
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:30.420]   the slope of the decline was exactly the same
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.080]   to the first decimal place.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:37.140]   It had not explained anything.
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:42.140]   I was like, "Oh my God, this looks like it might be real."
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.940]   - And for those listening, what Dr. Swan is describing
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.500]   is being the excellent scientist that she is,
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.620]   she went and looked for all the things
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:54.680]   that could impact the result that were not related
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:58.120]   to what the main conclusion seemed to be,
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:02.000]   which is that sperm counts were going down over time, right?
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.620]   And this is really important because I think
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.180]   what we're talking about here in parallel
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.140]   to the main conversation is how to do really great science,
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:14.620]   especially in human populations that are out there living.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.820]   Some of these men probably smoke some cannabis.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.180]   I'm not saying that reduces sperm count.
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.820]   It might reduce sperm motility, however.
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.060]   We covered that in the podcast.
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:24.540]   Now that all the cannabis folks go,
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:27.620]   well, so-and-so got so-and-so pregnant
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:29.240]   when they were doing a lot of weed.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.080]   And I always say, okay,
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.740]   well, there are a number of other factors, right?
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:37.120]   But alcohol, there's frequency of ejaculation, right?
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:41.280]   The requirement to abstain for 48 to 72 hours
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.020]   to up to five days prior, et cetera.
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:48.480]   All these factors that men may or may not faithfully report,
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.880]   but you assume that if some are telling the truth
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.220]   and some aren't, that there's an equal distribution of that.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:55.500]   So all the different things, right?
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.520]   This is so very different than looking at, for instance,
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:03.220]   ovarian reserve, like the number of eggs,
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.960]   where you use ultrasound and you use AMH levels.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.620]   And sure, things can impact that,
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.140]   but it's a little different
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.860]   than when we're taking sperm counts.
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:15.220]   So thank you for doing the studies so carefully
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.280]   and for repeating them so many times.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.740]   I mean, many of the studies that you've done
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:23.740]   are you've done follow-up on the sperm count studies
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.220]   across multiple years.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:27.620]   As you said, the first study was in 1992,
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:29.820]   then you did one in 2017, then there was one again,
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.700]   and there was an update I noticed online.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:34.500]   So you are extremely thorough,
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:37.820]   and it probably reflects your early training
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.740]   in math and statistics and probability theory.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.660]   You're not somebody to just kind of go in and go,
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:43.740]   oh yeah, like in these people
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:45.140]   that eat a few too much of this,
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:47.180]   then there's a little bit less of that.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.740]   So I just wanted, if today's discussion feels like
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:53.240]   we're really, we're lathing through this,
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.300]   that's intentional.
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:58.020]   And it's important for people to hear
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:00.180]   these kinds of claims are not the sort of thing
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:03.340]   that you could, people would make them all over the board,
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.300]   but work like this needs to be done
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:08.660]   with an extremely meticulous eye
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.300]   and consideration of all the variables.
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.180]   - Well, good scientific method, yeah.
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:13.060]   - Yeah, and I would say,
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:15.860]   especially with human epidemiological work,
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:19.220]   because of the number of potential confounding variables.
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:22.020]   - So when I saw that,
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:26.940]   and actually did another study to select my own studies
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:29.700]   and not accept her 61 studies that had been published,
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.020]   that Elizabeth Carlson had published.
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:36.180]   So new studies, came up to more recent times,
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.580]   went back further, did it again,
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:39.980]   found exactly the same thing.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.580]   Okay, so there were three looks at that,
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:44.840]   and I thought, okay, I'm gonna accept this now.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.040]   This is, sperm count is declining.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.900]   And why?
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.380]   That turned to the why.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.940]   Okay, because up and down now,
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:55.220]   we hadn't said anything about why.
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.220]   We just said, is it doing that?
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:01.620]   Yes, okay, now we believe it is declining, why?
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.740]   And so then I thought quite a lot and talked to people
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:07.580]   and ruled out genetics because it was too fast.
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:10.140]   It's two generations, it's too fast.
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:11.660]   50 years, two generations.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.620]   So if it's not genetics, then it's environment.
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:19.020]   And so what is it about the environment that could do this?
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:23.880]   So I asked, okay, in the environment,
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:28.500]   there could be things that are making sperm decline.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:32.300]   So if you think about how you might look at that,
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.340]   you might design the study that I designed next,
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:36.280]   which was another study.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:40.340]   And by the way, this preceded the AGD.
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.880]   So we had four cities in the United States
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.020]   that we picked with different environments.
[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:47.380]   And then we got men to come in
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:51.680]   and we used the same equipment at each place.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:55.620]   We used the same method of selecting the men.
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:59.700]   The technicians were trained centrally at UC Davis.
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.300]   We had very good quality control,
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.960]   so samples were sent around every quarter
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.020]   to make sure that everybody was measuring things
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.700]   the same way.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.860]   We didn't want drift, right?
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.940]   And then we got their urine.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.820]   And that's how I had those urine samples.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.180]   So if you wanted to do this study
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.820]   and you wanted to get a representative sample of men,
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.740]   where would you go?
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:25.300]   Because I can't ask a guy in the street
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.340]   to give me a semen sample right now.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.860]   It's not something you'd get very, you know.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:33.740]   So I thought, how can I get a representative sample
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.140]   and which would teach me something
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:39.060]   about a larger population called the parent population?
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.240]   So here's a sample, it should represent the parent.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.340]   So how do I ensure that?
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:47.780]   And what I decided was to sample partners of pregnant women
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:52.460]   because pregnant women all come to medical care, almost all.
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:55.580]   And if their partners will give a semen sample,
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.940]   then we have a representative sample
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.300]   and we know what we're looking at.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.500]   So that's what we did.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.140]   So this is the semen study
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.660]   is the study of partners of pregnant women.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:10.000]   And of course, they'll have slightly higher semen quality
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.460]   'cause they got their partner pregnant.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:16.460]   But, and so we had their urine, we had their blood
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:22.580]   and we looked at their semen quality
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:26.380]   and then we decided to look at pesticides.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.300]   And the reason we look at pesticides
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:32.100]   was because there was a lot of gradation
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.860]   across our four centers and pesticide use.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:38.800]   And what we found was really extraordinary
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.300]   that men who were living in Central Missouri,
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.580]   where I was living at the time,
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:47.020]   who were in the middle of a agricultural belt
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.860]   where there was spraying all the time
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.880]   for soybeans and so on.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.660]   Those men had half as many moving sperm
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.460]   as men in Minneapolis.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.580]   - Whoa.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:04.540]   - Whoa, huge, right?
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:09.540]   And then we went one step further and within Missouri,
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.620]   we looked at a sample of men
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:15.180]   who had very high sperm parameters
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:16.980]   and very low sperm parameters
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:21.100]   and showed that five pesticides were significantly higher
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.660]   in the men with the low sperm parameters.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.660]   That include motility, morphology, all the parameters.
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.700]   - So these are pesticides
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.580]   that are being sprayed in the air on crops.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.660]   You mentioned soybeans, what other types of crops?
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.660]   - I don't know.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:34.500]   - Okay.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.820]   - I don't remember.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:38.620]   - So plant and fruit crops, presumably.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.780]   - Yeah, whatever they were growing
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.740]   in Columbia, Missouri at that time.
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.420]   - And just to make sure I understand,
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:47.260]   it's not that the men eat--
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.540]   - Soybeans, corn and soybeans.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.380]   - Corn and soybeans.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.660]   But we're not talking about eating corn and soybeans.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.300]   We're talking about living in an area
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.580]   where pesticides are being used
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.640]   by, is it still called dust crop?
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.000]   - Yeah, we didn't go into how they got these.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.740]   We just looked in their urine and there were the metabolites.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.740]   The metabolites don't get in their urine
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.140]   unless they were exposed.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.780]   - Exposed through the air or exposed
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:09.620]   by eating corn and soybeans?
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.460]   - Don't know.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:11.280]   - We don't know.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.120]   - We don't know.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:12.960]   - Okay.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.780]   - We don't know.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.340]   But this was not a particularly,
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.660]   you know, we didn't sample farmers only
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.500]   or anything like that.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.900]   So whoever came into the,
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.460]   you remember how we got these men?
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.780]   Their wives were pregnant.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.360]   They were having prenatal care
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.260]   at the University of Missouri.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.420]   So that's where we got them.
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:31.260]   Whoever happened to come in to the prenatal clinic
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.060]   and agreed to be in our study,
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.420]   their, the male, you know, urine,
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.360]   male's urine was measured for these pesticides.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.820]   - I'm sure a number of people,
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.840]   including myself are wondering,
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:48.980]   in what other products are these five pesticides present?
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.180]   Are these commonly used pesticides
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.620]   or is it something about-
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.060]   - They're called the triazine pesticides.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.180]   Atrazine was the most widely used
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:02.380]   and it's a huge use around the world.
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.380]   I mean, it's highly, you know,
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.780]   one of the most, the largest commercial pesticides.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:11.340]   So these were very big players in the pesticide field.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:14.020]   - A relevant theme there would be,
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:16.420]   maybe we could take a moment and talk about atrazine
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:21.180]   and its effect on male sexual behavior in amphibia.
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:24.540]   And we'll come back to the sperm studies
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:28.240]   because when I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley,
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.260]   I had the wonderful experience of taking a course
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:33.740]   from the now, I think you mentioned he's a dean.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.060]   There are multiple deans on campuses.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.140]   Tyrone Hayes is a wonderful researcher
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:41.220]   who established a link through his research
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:43.980]   between atrazine exposure
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:48.980]   and male sexual behavior of amphibia.
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:52.300]   Could you elaborate on that result?
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:57.300]   - Yeah, so Tyrone first caught frogs in the wild
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:02.140]   in environments that were more or less exposed to atrazine
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:05.840]   and showed effects on development and sexual behavior.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.860]   Then he, in his lab, he actually exposed them.
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:12.260]   So he knew exactly who was exposed and how much.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:15.100]   And he showed that the,
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.900]   and I can't tell you what percent or what, you know,
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.220]   but a significant number of frogs exposed
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.740]   to this pesticide atrazine
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:27.320]   chose to mate with other male frogs.
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.020]   - Tried to mate with other male frogs,
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.260]   presumably unsuccessfully.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.100]   - Well, they mounted them.
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:35.700]   He has photos of the males mounting males.
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:40.260]   - And so presumably this is a neural change that occurred,
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.740]   neuroendocrine change, but ultimately neural
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.100]   since mounting behavior is controlled by,
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.740]   actually we now know the hypothalamic nuclei
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:49.580]   that control this.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.060]   David Anderson, who's been on this podcast,
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.060]   has people in his laboratory that,
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.260]   including a former graduate student of mine,
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.760]   working on this specific issue of what the circuitry is.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:06.740]   That's a remarkable result.
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:10.000]   It's been kind of, you know,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.160]   used and misused out there in the media
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.000]   and in popular culture.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:15.960]   But if nothing else,
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.240]   it suggests that the organization of the neural circuits
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.240]   and neuroendocrine pathways that control sexual,
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.840]   I don't want to say partner because it is mating thing.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:28.920]   Frogs aren't monogamous,
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:33.920]   but sexual preference are significantly impacted
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.320]   by this atrazine.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.160]   - Yes.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.560]   And it suggests that there are other
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.100]   environmental chemicals can as well.
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.720]   And I don't know if we'll have time to go there,
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:50.720]   but I did work on neurodevelopmental outcomes
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.640]   in relation to prenatal phthalate exposure.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:58.400]   And so I think the overarching idea here
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:03.400]   is that the brain, like the genitals, is sexually dimorphic.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.160]   And there's many people, by the way,
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.120]   who will take offense at that.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.200]   - Really? - Yeah.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.200]   - I think there's, I mean,
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.540]   going back to the work of Frank Beach
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.720]   in the psychology department at UC Berkeley.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.740]   - I know.
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.280]   - Showed this in beagles.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.420]   It's been shown in pretty much every species,
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.640]   but it's not a better, worse.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.760]   I think this is what people need to hear.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.480]   Like dimorphic does not mean better, worse.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.160]   It means different. - Right, right.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:28.480]   And that there, and there are, for example,
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.920]   advantages to spatial reasoning in a male,
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:38.800]   which are related to testosterone, right?
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.640]   You know that.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.840]   - I mean, I think there, yeah.
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.520]   I mean, my understanding of this literature,
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.020]   and I'm not an expert in this particular aspect,
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.360]   which is the behavioral phenotypes,
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:51.000]   but like the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.360]   is known to be sexually dimorphic,
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.200]   dependent on testosterone converted into estrogen
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.920]   during development, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.220]   And there's just so much evidence of this.
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:03.360]   How it links to behaviors is can,
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.040]   I think can be reasonably placed
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.040]   into ethologically relevant,
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:13.080]   evolutionarily logical arguments
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.960]   when talking about rodents or beagles
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.340]   or even rhesus macaque monkeys.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:22.200]   I think where people get a bit inflamed
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.400]   is when people try and take the sexual dimorphisms
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.880]   that have been observed in animal brains
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.360]   or in even in human brains
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:34.120]   and tack those to specific abilities or lesser abilities.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.160]   I think that's when people sort of go, wait a second,
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.640]   like I have much better sense of direction than my husband.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.360]   And you go, well, yeah, like, you know,
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.900]   and then you go, well, well, does that mean
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.400]   that she has higher testosterone than him?
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.840]   And then maybe, and then, and pretty soon you're,
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.320]   you're in almost a no man's land,
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:54.320]   a no person's land of confounding variables, right?
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.440]   But I really appreciate that you raised this
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.900]   and also that you said it and I didn't
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.480]   because I feel safer that way.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.080]   - But look, there is a very simple,
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.840]   outdated questionnaire and it's play behavior.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.200]   It's called the PSAI.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.760]   It's been used for years.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.080]   Have you heard?
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.200]   - Rough and tumble play.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.600]   - Yes, yes.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.240]   And there are 24 questions on there
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:21.600]   and they are sexually dimorphic, I guess you could say.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.920]   My child likes to play with dolls.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.320]   My child likes to play dress up.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:30.280]   My child likes to play rough and tumble, et cetera.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:34.840]   And we gave that questionnaire to our population
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:40.580]   and looked at the answers that the mothers gave,
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.940]   both in our population, by the way,
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:44.960]   and a Swedish population of a colleague there,
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.380]   Carl Bornahag and Gustav Bornahag.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:54.380]   And what we found, higher phthalate levels,
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:59.800]   these anti-androgenic phthalates were associated
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:04.800]   with less masculine male typical play in our male boys.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.720]   So-
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:11.360]   - This is phthalate exposure to the mom.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.080]   - Baby is born in the young human child.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.200]   - Yeah, I think it was four years of age.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.120]   - Four years of age, less rough and tumble type play
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.080]   among the boys whose mothers were exposed to more phthalates
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.600]   during a critical period of development.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.420]   - Now you can see that's a politically loaded issue now.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.760]   - Well, I think we're,
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.280]   I mean, let's have some fun with this
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.420]   in the scientific sense.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.820]   The notion of dimorphism is,
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.160]   okay, male and female brains are different, right?
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.160]   And male, female defined in those,
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.720]   almost all those studies as presence of a Y chromosome.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.840]   And then people say, well, there's X, Y, Y,
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.200]   and then there's X, X, Y, okay.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.720]   But most of the time you're talking about X, X chromosome
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.840]   or X, Y chromosomes at birth.
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.900]   Forget everything else for the moment.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:02.640]   These are always distributions.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.060]   This is what I think people need to know.
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:05.800]   We're not talking about, these are not,
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.800]   this is not two hills of data separated by a valley.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.560]   These are overlapping distributions, right?
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.400]   So you get males with a "female-like distribution",
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.320]   you get females with a "male-like distribution".
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.760]   And I think as long as we acknowledge that,
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.840]   then we're just talking statistics.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.800]   We're not placing any cultural
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.200]   or any value on it really whatsoever.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.800]   - Right, but if you could make the analog
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:35.200]   to the intergenital distance,
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.560]   it's kind of similar, you know,
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.360]   you have the same exposure, phthalate exposure,
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.580]   you have something changed statistically.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.200]   We don't see huge differences in the boys' genitals.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.320]   And we don't see huge, I don't, we know,
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.520]   these kids have not been scanned,
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.920]   so we don't know how their brains look.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.520]   But based on their answers, we don't see huge differences.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.560]   We see tendencies.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.520]   We see they are more likely,
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.280]   if they had been exposed to these phthalates,
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:04.320]   to want to play dress up and have tea parties.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.040]   More likely, doesn't mean that they're all going to,
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.920]   but that's the direction and so on.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.240]   So I think we have to just think about
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.400]   more likely, not absolute, yeah.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:18.100]   - And of course there are also the sociobiological variables,
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:23.100]   such as if a young boy has a sibling that's a sister,
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:26.400]   there's more likely to be dresses around, right?
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.880]   She's gonna, if he has two older brothers,
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.120]   there might be more rough and tumble play
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:30.960]   happening in the house.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.960]   And I have some friends that are women
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.760]   who have older brothers, and those women are,
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.200]   some of them roll jujitsu or do,
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.920]   and I know some women who are only children
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.480]   who do martial arts and fight, right?
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.480]   So I think that none of this is deterministic, as we know.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.400]   - But let me just add,
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.880]   we did control for the sex of the sibling, older sibling,
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.200]   and we also asked about the parents' attitude
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.840]   just towards same-sex play.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.920]   So what would, how would you feel if your child,
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.280]   your male child played with dolls?
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.040]   Would you be discouraging?
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.240]   Would you encourage?
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.920]   'Cause it has a lot to do with what's in the house.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.760]   You know, if you say, "Did your child play with dolls?"
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.200]   Well, what if there were no dolls?
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.400]   - This is super interesting to me.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.000]   I don't wanna reveal too much, but I grew up,
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   just because it's not, it's just an N of one,
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.200]   but I grew up in a household where I have a sister,
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.120]   but then after a certain age,
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.000]   I received very strong messages
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   about what sorts of play were gender appropriate.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.960]   And I think I also just naturally defaulted to,
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.260]   there were a bunch of boys that lived in my neighborhood.
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.360]   They had older sisters,
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.920]   so all the sisters hung out together.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.760]   It's kind of interesting,
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.120]   and all the younger brothers pretty much hung out together,
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.240]   and the guys that weren't, didn't have siblings
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.640]   or had brothers who were siblings.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.480]   So there was a really strong divergence,
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.000]   but I grew up in the, that was in the '70s and early '80s
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.640]   when things were, let's just say,
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.680]   culture was more dimorphic then, clearly.
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.840]   I mean, there were television shows like "All in the Family,"
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.240]   which the entire basis of the show
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.000]   was the wife going back to work
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.240]   and the husband being confused about it.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.400]   I mean, nowadays people will go like, "What? That's wild."
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.120]   I have to ask, because I know people are wondering,
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.320]   and I'm wondering,
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:15.920]   what are some non-pesticide sources of phthalates
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.880]   that we have agency over, that we can take control over?
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.560]   - Right, so let me correct you.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:26.760]   It's not the sources of phthalates necessarily.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.180]   Pesticides, there are phthalates in pesticides,
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:35.640]   but that's not the worst player in the story.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:41.840]   If you look at the different classes of exposures
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.760]   that are hormonally active, right?
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   Pesticides are, phthalates are, bisphenols,
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.840]   like bisphenol A. - BPA.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:56.400]   - BPA, certain metals are, there's the PFAS chemicals.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.880]   There's all these different classes, right?
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.240]   And if we want to go, excuse me,
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:06.240]   into what in our daily life exposes us to these things,
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.380]   that's another story that we can talk about,
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.200]   but they're going to be different
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.480]   depending on the class, right?
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.360]   - So let's throw our arms
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.720]   around all of those for the moment.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.400]   And I'll just ask you,
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.440]   given that you're an expert in this area,
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:28.440]   what are the top three to five sources
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.440]   of endocrine disruptors that we have agency over?
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.280]   And let's forget about pregnancy for the moment
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:39.760]   since we're all out of the womb if we're listening to this.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.120]   Some people will be pregnant as they listen to it,
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.600]   but would you say it's, you know,
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.440]   drinking out of plastic bottles?
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.080]   Is it laundry detergent?
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:52.080]   Is it, you know, rubber tires
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.520]   that are cascading down on us through the air
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.600]   and we're inhaling them?
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.180]   I mean, presumably all of the above,
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:00.060]   but which ones that we have agency over
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.520]   do you think are the most, let's just say,
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.900]   concerning where people could make better choices?
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:11.360]   - I would say foodborne exposures,
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.760]   exposures in the food, in the food packaging,
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:19.400]   in the food storage, in the food, in the cooking utensils.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.680]   We can go through the various things,
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.680]   but we're doing that all the time.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.040]   We're eating all the time.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.760]   We're getting food into us.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.080]   And these are bringing in a very, you know,
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.640]   in a way that we have some control over,
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.240]   some agency over, you know,
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.880]   we can make changes in our foods.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.180]   Very close to that is drink, you know, food and beverage.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:54.320]   So I, first of all, I've talked about this a lot.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.920]   I've written about it in my book.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.120]   I'm also, as you know, involved in a movie
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.560]   where in the movie,
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.640]   that might be a good time to talk about that.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.400]   What we do in the movie,
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:10.400]   the movie is about six couples that are infertile, okay?
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.520]   They haven't been able to conceive in 12 months.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.240]   That's the definition.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.320]   And then a company that I work with,
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.640]   Million Marker out of Berkeley,
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:25.020]   has a trained staff that interviews them.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:29.040]   Not only them, but anyone who signs into this company,
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.880]   interviews them and ask them what they use.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:35.200]   What do they use for their facial care?
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.600]   What do they use for their shampoo?
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.740]   What do they use for their cleaning products
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.960]   and their laundry detergent?
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.840]   And what do they store their food in?
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.880]   And on and on and on.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.520]   So this is long inventory that they take
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:49.960]   of all products that people are aware of using, okay?
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.360]   And based on that,
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.360]   we identify likely bad players in the list.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.560]   So how we do that is another,
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.020]   you know, we can talk about that later.
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:08.020]   But then in the film and in this little,
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.080]   it's actually an experiment that I designed
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.600]   and called an intervention.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.960]   And we are then intervening in their exposures
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.440]   by changing out these things that they told us.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.000]   So we will tell them, you know,
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.960]   don't use any product with fragrance, for example.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.760]   That's a major source of exposure to phthalates.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.600]   - Any product.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:31.960]   - Any fragrance product.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.800]   If fragrance is added-
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:36.360]   - So no perfume, no lotions, soap with fragrance.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.200]   - Right.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.880]   - Even essential oil fragrances like lavender.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.440]   - Essential oil is a tricky-
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.440]   - Right, it's a mix.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.360]   - It's a mix, yeah.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.480]   So I'm gonna, that's guarded.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.480]   But anything, you know-
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.560]   - Spray deodorants, roll-on deodorants.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:50.560]   - Laundry detergent.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.400]   - Shampoo.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.200]   - Yep, and any, if you can smell it,
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.080]   it's probably affecting your hormones.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.260]   - I'm so happy about this answer.
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:00.160]   Not because I have any stake in any company
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.560]   related to fragrance-free stuff,
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.920]   but I have a very strong sense of smell
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.460]   and I either love or hate smells,
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.140]   and I hate synthetic smells.
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.620]   Like going through the duty-free,
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.080]   especially in a European airport
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.400]   to wear it with all the perfumes,
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.560]   and I'm just, "Oh, I'm gonna hold my breath."
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.320]   It feels like I'm breathing poison.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.160]   - I know.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.640]   - Well-
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.560]   - Well, you are actually.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:26.040]   - Yeah, yeah, and most soaps, right.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.200]   Super interesting.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.760]   So that's your primary intervention
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.800]   is to tell them get rid of anything with fragrances.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.920]   - No, that's only one thing we get rid of.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.920]   So then we talk about how the plastics
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.440]   that they use to store their food,
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.240]   food storage containers,
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.640]   trying to get them to get rid of those
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.040]   if they're made of plastic.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.320]   We try to get them to get rid of their non-stick pans
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.720]   because of the PFAS chemicals that are in those,
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.120]   and so on and so forth.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.320]   So we go through all steps of their life
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.320]   and try to tell them how to make changes
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.600]   that will reduce their exposure.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:01.120]   - But presumably also changes,
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.640]   like if the man is obese, for instance,
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.440]   you might have him walking a bit more.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.280]   - No, no, no.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:07.100]   - You don't touch any of that?
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:09.440]   - Well, you see, Andrew, if we did that,
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.200]   we would be mixing up two interventions.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.740]   We would be mixing up an obesity intervention.
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:15.840]   - I see, this is a study.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.400]   I'm sorry, I thought that this group
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:20.880]   is missioned with helping couples get pregnant.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.700]   - No, no, this is a study to look at what happens
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.360]   if you make these product-related changes.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.920]   - Great, just product-related changes.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.160]   - Right, exactly, exactly.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.280]   We would love to do, and probably will do,
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.800]   another study, separate one on obesity.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.480]   And a lot of these chemicals,
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.580]   just to let you know, are obesogens.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:40.960]   They increase obesity.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:43.380]   There's a book out called "Obesogens."
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.360]   You can read about them.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.520]   And so it's very, there is some overlap.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.680]   So by reducing some of these chemicals
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.320]   that are in your food storage containers,
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.400]   you're also reducing obesogens.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.400]   So it's not a clear yes/no.
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.760]   We gave them a box, each couple.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.160]   I went to their house, six couples
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.280]   around the United States, with a big box.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.720]   And in this box are these alternative products.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:12.720]   And so, you know, straws, and bamboo spoons,
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.920]   and you know, $500 per box, I think it was, approximately.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.720]   It had to do with their personal, you know, exposure.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.600]   And then they made these changes.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.600]   Now, unlike another study that you reported,
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.480]   they are, at the end, quite happy
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.940]   to keep doing this, by the way.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:35.040]   They love this.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.600]   They love doing this.
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.960]   It was so gratifying to see that they felt,
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.600]   in many, many ways, their life got better.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.920]   You know, I'm not a, I'm pretty careful in what I,
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:51.120]   so I hesitate to say this, 'cause the data is not hard,
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:56.120]   but the impression is that they are happy, happier.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.440]   They're sleeping better, they report more energy,
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:02.320]   and so on and so forth, having made these changes.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.760]   We need to follow that up with hard data.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.440]   I'm not writing that, I'm not, you know.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:09.660]   But that, they, but I can say, and I can write,
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.440]   that they felt very positive, and are,
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.240]   we're gonna go back and see if they did continue.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.680]   We need to do that.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.440]   But at the end of the six, of the three months,
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.120]   they, and hopefully in six months, they will,
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.140]   they are still making these changes in their lives.
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.600]   - Did you collect data on whether or not
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.320]   they were able to conceive after having made these changes?
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.240]   - Yes, we did, but I actually can't talk about that.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.240]   - Can't talk about it, until the babies are born.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.840]   - Just kidding.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.700]   - And we did get their sperm count
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.040]   at the beginning and the end,
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.680]   and had some very interesting data on that, which--
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.040]   - Too early to report.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:44.880]   - Too early to report.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.600]   - Let me ask you this then, and I appreciate that the,
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:52.440]   not wanting to share specific results until this,
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.440]   all the data are in, and it's published.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:59.880]   If somebody listening were having trouble conceiving
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.400]   for 12 months or more,
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.640]   are the sorts of replacement interventions,
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.040]   product interventions that you're talking about here,
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:14.120]   things that you would at least feel comfortable saying
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.600]   might be a good place to start, or to explore?
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.040]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.080]   There's no harm.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.800]   None of the changes are putting people at risk
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.880]   or doing anything that could be harmful to them.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.000]   I'm sure of that.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.200]   We're very careful.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.840]   - And some are going to be cost-saving.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:34.160]   And I think that's where drinking out of plastic bottles,
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.480]   far less, if at all.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:39.640]   Just for reasons related to wanting to reduce waste,
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:42.920]   I use a mason jar, or I use these, or ceramic.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:43.880]   Although you'll probably tell me
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.620]   that the lining on the ceramic mug
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.320]   might have endocrine disruptors.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.160]   No, I don't.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.000]   - I don't think so.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:49.820]   - Okay, great, okay.
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:51.320]   Well, then I'll keep drinking.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.920]   But it's very reassuring to me that there are things
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.100]   that we can do in terms of cost-saving elimination
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.120]   or replacement of consumables.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:23:59.960]   - Buying in bulk.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:02.920]   - That can improve endocrine status, maybe fertility also.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.960]   - If you can buy in bulk, bring a container to the store
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.640]   and fill it up, a glass jar,
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:09.840]   instead of buying something in plastic,
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.240]   you're winning on both ends
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.280]   because those bulk products are cheaper.
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:16.160]   One of the things I did with the couples
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.480]   was go shop with them.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:19.840]   And we went around and we looked at various products.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.080]   And for example, we looked at the produce
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:27.080]   and there was option to buy freestanding bunches of lettuce,
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.600]   heads of lettuce, or wrapped up
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.520]   in plastic bunches of lettuce.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.360]   And I said, "Let's compare the price."
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.720]   I actually didn't know until we did it.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.560]   But the freestanding unwrapped lettuce was cheaper.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:42.480]   And I think that's, you know, because that makes sense
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.240]   'cause there's a work involved in wrapping it up
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.960]   in the container and so on.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:50.880]   And so not only are you getting something that's more toxic,
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.040]   but it's more expensive.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.400]   - When it comes to reducing BPA exposure
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.400]   and some of these forever chemicals that you mentioned,
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:04.200]   it seems like reducing fluid intake from plastic vessels
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.640]   is gonna be number one.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.800]   - The primary source of BPA is in the lining of cans.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:14.800]   So any drink or soup or anything that comes in a can
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.480]   is going to be-
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:21.000]   - Any can, all can. - Any can.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   Unless it's a high-end, you know, elite company
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.880]   that's made the change from BPA to an alternative lining.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.240]   And they'll say that.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:36.240]   So, and by the way, BPA has some bad relatives
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.160]   such as BPS and BPF.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.480]   And maybe you'd be interested in this story.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.960]   So when it came out that BPA was estrogenic,
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.480]   which is what it is, and by the way,
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.400]   it's kind of the evil twin of phthalates
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   because phthalates are androgenic and BPA is estrogenic
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:59.200]   and phthalates make plastic soft and BPA makes plastic hard.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.440]   You don't want either.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:05.100]   Okay, so when this came out that this was a bad thing,
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:10.400]   the manufacturers started selling things that say BPA-free.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.480]   I'm sure you've seen that.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.240]   The trick is that instead of BPA, they use BPS.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.820]   - Sneaky rats. - And BPF.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:21.320]   And these are chemicals, these are lookalikes,
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.680]   they're analogs, and they're just as harmful.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:26.380]   - Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky.
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:29.480]   I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but it's just so dirty.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.500]   It's so dirty.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.960]   It's like, it's, you know, right now
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.880]   is a really important time to be having this discussion
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.620]   because there's been a lot of movement on Capitol Hill
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.480]   and there's been a lot of movement on social media
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:43.560]   about trying to call attention to metabolic syndromes
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.240]   and highly processed foods and issues like this.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.400]   And it's become unfortunately politicized.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.380]   I mean, I hear this stuff and I just think to myself,
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:55.840]   the only good faith that we can really trust
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:00.080]   is our own desire to be healthier
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:03.360]   and to have our families and friends be healthier
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.440]   and to try and consume and not consume things
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.720]   on the basis of that.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:11.720]   My belief is that we can't trust any larger agency
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.120]   to either protect or harm us.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.640]   It's like, it's not, it's like,
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.960]   they're gonna do what they're gonna do.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.440]   We just have to be informed.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:21.400]   As opposed to trying to dismantle the systems
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.240]   that led to this,
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.340]   which just seems like infinitely complicated.
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:27.780]   Maybe you can do that, but I'm far less optimistic.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:29.120]   And now that I'm 49 years old,
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:32.520]   I can say things like, now that I'm 49, I feel like.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.440]   But what you're saying is really important.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.760]   If I look at a can, it says BPA-free.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.600]   Doesn't mean anything.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:41.480]   It could have BPSs or other endocrine disruptors.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.320]   - Right.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.360]   - So drinking out of glass vessels,
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.520]   drinking out of ceramic vessels.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.200]   - Metal.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.840]   - Metal, but not cans, not metal cans, not aluminum cans.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.060]   - Right, not cans, no.
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.320]   - Goodness, okay.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:58.360]   - You know, you can get a metal water bottle.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.120]   It's not lined with BPA.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:00.960]   - Steel.
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:01.780]   - Steel, yeah.
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:02.620]   - Steel.
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:06.000]   And is it true that microwave safe means,
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.760]   it just means that the plastic won't melt in the microwave,
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.600]   but it's-
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.760]   - Never, never put plastic in a microwave.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:16.040]   So here's the story.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:21.040]   The BPA, phthalates, plasticizers are added to the plastic,
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:26.960]   but they're not chemically bound to it, okay?
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:30.660]   So if you put anything in a container
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.800]   that has these chemicals in it, they will,
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.640]   and then put it in a hot environment,
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.180]   they will come out of the plastic and go into the food.
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:46.440]   So if you, in a microwave, or you put your bottle in the car
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.960]   and the sun comes in, it warms up the bottle,
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.920]   and then the stuff goes into your water.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.940]   You don't wanna mix these chemicals and your food,
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:57.320]   but if you do, the worst thing is to do it
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.760]   in a heated environment.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.680]   - I think about all the food that was consumed in college
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:05.840]   in the '90s and 2000s, like the cup of noodles
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.840]   with the styrofoam, the things in packaging,
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:13.240]   stuff like that is pretty straightforward to eliminate
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:16.040]   once one understands and decides.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.460]   Then we start getting into the more nuanced thing of like,
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:22.820]   okay, you can buy a really nice tasting anyway,
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:26.320]   grass-fed, grass-finished steak, but it's wrapped in plastic.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:29.680]   Well, or you can go to the butcher,
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:32.300]   but most people don't have time to go to the butcher.
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.960]   Or you can get strawberries at the farmer's market,
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.120]   blueberries at the farmer's market,
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.840]   which is what I try to do,
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.880]   but sometimes I buy strawberries at the market
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:41.600]   and they have those plastic flip-top things,
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.180]   and of course I recycle the plastic.
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:48.180]   How bad is it if you rinse the strawberries off
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:51.920]   with good clean water that were in the plastic container?
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:53.840]   - We have to do that experiment, I don't know.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.600]   - Yeah, so it sounds to me like not drinking out of cans,
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.560]   not drinking out of plastic bottles,
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:03.640]   it's gonna be not microwaving plastic ever.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:07.200]   And in general, just avoiding plastic intake.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.880]   - If you can afford it, buy organic.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.240]   So you're gonna avoid the pesticides,
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.920]   and then phthalates are actually added to pesticides.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.880]   And they're added because they increase absorption.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:23.000]   So you want your pesticides to get into the plant, right?
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.680]   And to kill the bad stuff and insects.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:31.680]   And so the same property of phthalates
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.640]   that makes them good for pesticides
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:37.040]   also makes them good for our hand cream.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.180]   Just mentioning, absorption, absorption.
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:41.520]   Anything that's absorbed in the body
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.520]   is gonna have phthalates in it.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:47.120]   And it also holds scent and color.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:49.040]   So it's added to those scents,
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.760]   and it's also added to your lipstick
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.280]   and to your colored, you know,
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.360]   whatever you put on your face and so on.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:57.200]   Anything that holds scent and color,
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.000]   that's gonna be phthalates.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.320]   (laughs)
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.920]   - I'm accused online of being a sunscreen truther.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.560]   I'm not a sunscreen truther.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.520]   I'm gonna keep repeating this as many times as I can.
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:13.520]   I understand that UV damage to the skin
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.220]   can cause certain cancers.
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:16.100]   I get that.
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:18.200]   I agree with that.
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:21.560]   The data are pretty clear to me
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.600]   based on having researched this pretty extensively
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:24.720]   and talked to many, many people,
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:25.960]   including dermal oncologists,
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.900]   that mineral-based sunscreens like zinc oxide
[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.360]   and titanium dioxide,
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.640]   but certainly zinc oxide,
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:34.520]   are safer than the chemical sunscreens.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.160]   A lot of people get upset when I say that,
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:37.080]   and they say, "Well, in Europe,
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:37.940]   "there's tons of evidence
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:39.840]   "that the chemical-based sunscreens are gonna save it."
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.200]   Okay, fine, you use them.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:42.560]   I'm not going to.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.100]   The point being that UV damage is bad.
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:51.120]   There are ways to protect ourselves from the sun,
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:55.420]   including physical barriers like clothing, hats, et cetera.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.760]   But pretty much all sunscreen that I'm aware of
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:02.380]   is designed to be absorbed.
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:05.160]   So what do we do if we want to get some UV protection
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:08.680]   from whatever kind of sunscreen we deem safe for ourselves,
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.360]   but we want to avoid these exposures to these other things?
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.520]   What do we do?
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:13.920]   Do we have to hunt really carefully
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.120]   for the right sunscreen?
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:19.360]   - Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.520]   Are you familiar with Environmental Working Group?
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.260]   - Is another one out of the Bay Area?
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:25.100]   - No. - Oh, okay.
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:26.440]   - I don't know actually where they are.
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.280]   They're pretty big.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.920]   - It sounds familiar, but I'm not,
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:29.760]   I can't say I'm familiar with them.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.840]   - So they have consumer guides,
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:35.160]   and in those consumer, so Environmental Working Group,
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:38.680]   I'm not part of them, but I like their work.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.640]   And in these consumer guides, you can put in the product,
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:42.660]   and they have categories.
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.140]   You can put sunscreen,
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.880]   if we had time, we could do it right now,
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.720]   and then you can put the name of your sunscreen,
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.040]   and it'll give you a number.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.440]   And then if the number is less than 10,
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.480]   it'll tell you why.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:56.360]   - Are they independent of any funding?
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:57.380]   - Yeah.
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:59.880]   - That question will probably come up for you too.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:04.520]   People will say, "Where did she get her funding?"
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.480]   You know, people get very suspicious about this.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.600]   - I can tell you that.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.480]   - Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:13.480]   - Yeah, so I am a tenure professor at Mount Sinai,
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:16.880]   get some salary there because I'm only part-time,
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:19.840]   and I have a funder, one funder,
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:23.380]   who funded my sperm decline,
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:26.720]   second sperm decline analysis,
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:27.880]   and the publicity of my book.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.640]   So it's a foundation.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.800]   - So it's philanthropy.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.120]   - Yeah, it's philanthropy, yeah.
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:34.800]   And it's actually not a lot of money.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.160]   - And so there's no reason to think
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.760]   that anything that you're telling us
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.800]   is linked to like the food industry
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.560]   or an alternative product or anything.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:45.640]   - I'm very, very careful not to endorse any product
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.200]   because I don't want that complication.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:49.720]   - Yeah, thanks for clarifying that.
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.560]   I wasn't suspicious, but I think nowadays,
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.680]   people have just been taught to, you know,
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.240]   appropriately so, they've been taught to say,
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:58.680]   well, wait, where does this funding come from?
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:01.000]   Because a lot of the studies about the,
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.560]   that led to the food pyramid, for instance,
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.920]   people were under the impression
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:08.060]   that somehow that was biased by companies
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:09.320]   that were funding the work.
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.400]   And I don't know, I haven't done the forensics on that.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.480]   I don't have the time or the energy.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:18.480]   All I know is that when it comes to what people eat,
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:22.060]   when it comes to what people put on their body,
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.280]   it becomes a very personal thing
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:28.060]   and it's woven in with a lot of psychological
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:29.400]   and emotional issues.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah, okay.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.440]   What are a few things that you do
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:42.040]   and or avoid in light of what you know
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.120]   about these endocrine disruptors?
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:46.000]   And by the way, it goes without saying
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.980]   that you're in spectacular cognitive
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:51.080]   and physical shape for any age,
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.700]   but it's really remarkable.
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:54.400]   I feel comfortable sharing this
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.480]   because someone else published it online recently.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.760]   You are soon to enjoy your what birthday?
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.400]   - 89th. - 89th birthday, amazing.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.740]   And with all the talk about longevity,
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:06.020]   cognitive and physical longevity,
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.680]   everyone's thinking, including me, like, what does she do?
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:11.800]   Well, she avoids all these endocrine disruptors
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.440]   and she has a wonderfully rich life
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.920]   of curiosity and other things.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.680]   But yeah, what are some other things that you do
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.360]   and avoid in light of what you know
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.280]   for which there may or may not be a controlled study,
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.900]   but I think we're all just curious.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:28.400]   We'll frame this as what you do.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.740]   - So water, our water, I worry about the water.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:36.160]   I studied water for a long time in my past life.
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:39.240]   So we actually distill our water.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:42.180]   So we have a tabletop distiller.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:44.280]   My husband, Steven, cleans it out.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.860]   There's a lot of gunk in it, by the way,
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:48.220]   even though it's San Francisco that has clean water,
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:50.760]   at the end of the day, after you've distilled the water,
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.600]   there's a lot of gunk.
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.040]   - So you distill the water, so this is not reverse osmosis.
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.800]   - No, distilling. - Okay.
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:57.840]   - Yeah, so it's steam distilled
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:00.520]   and then it condenses in a glass container.
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:03.400]   And then we put that in glass containers in the fridge.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.360]   And so, and it tastes really good, by the way,
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.320]   really, really.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.360]   Somebody was just over and he said,
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.240]   "This tastes like melted snow."
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:13.080]   I thought it was lovely.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.340]   - And you use that for drinking, for coffee, for tea,
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:17.600]   for cooking too, if you make rice, you're using distilled.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.660]   - Actually, no, no.
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:20.900]   But for ice cubes and, you know,
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:22.480]   whenever I can think about it.
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:25.520]   We can't use too much 'cause it'd be too busy.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:26.920]   He always does it.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.560]   But he does it once a day.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:29.680]   It's just the two of us.
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:31.520]   So water is important.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.080]   We try to leave our shoes at the door.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:37.120]   - Tell me about that one.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.200]   - Well, dust that you bring in contains a lot of the,
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.340]   particularly the PFAS chemicals.
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:48.340]   And so that's actually, I'm not 100% good on that,
[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:51.060]   but we try to do that.
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:55.460]   And I'm careful with the products I put on my face.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:57.980]   I check them out the way I suggested,
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:00.500]   you know, environmental working group.
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:02.860]   And I go to the farmer's market.
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:06.540]   I always buy organic, always buy organic.
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:08.940]   But I know that's a cost issue for some people
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:12.340]   and an availability issue for some people.
[01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:14.580]   But in San Francisco, you can do that.
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:21.260]   Some areas where I don't do more of what I should,
[01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:25.180]   I think I'm starting to be aware of the chemicals
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:26.580]   in clothing.
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:27.740]   We haven't talked about that,
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:30.380]   but there's a, turns out there's a lot of,
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:33.580]   particularly in, it's a problem for workout wear
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.020]   because you're absorbing so much,
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.100]   you're sweaty, you're hot,
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:38.380]   and you're bringing these chemicals into your body.
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:41.100]   And that may be one of the interventions that we do,
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:46.060]   get a bunch of athletes to use safe clothing
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.260]   and traditional clothing
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:50.460]   and see what their body burden is.
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:51.460]   That's how you know.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:56.460]   - So erring toward cotton as opposed to synthetic materials.
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.580]   - Right, and the dyes are important.
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:01.940]   So you don't want, you want maybe plant-based dyes.
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:03.380]   It's not my area of expertise.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:05.340]   I have a colleague who I work with on this
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:07.300]   and I'll go with her advice.
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:10.460]   But I'm just saying that's another area
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:13.660]   that I think people will soon be paying attention to.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:17.700]   There's also the area that is much more difficult,
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:21.140]   which is what's in building materials and furniture.
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:24.180]   But a lot of these PFAS and the flame retardants
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:27.100]   are in our furniture and in our building materials
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:30.260]   and trying to think about how to build.
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:32.780]   I was asked about safety in a new village
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:34.740]   that's being built in California, by the way.
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:37.780]   And it's really challenging to think about
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.100]   if you were gonna do this right
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:44.380]   and you were gonna build a town that was toxic-free,
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:45.540]   how would you do that?
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:48.740]   I'm thinking about that.
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:50.700]   - I'm thinking about the opener of "The Simpsons"
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:52.420]   and doing the exact opposite,
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:54.020]   where like in the opener of "The Simpsons"
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:55.220]   there's like a three-eyed fish
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:56.740]   and there's the chemical plant.
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:57.580]   And I'm just thinking,
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:58.740]   you just look at the opener of "The Simpsons,"
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:01.100]   you do the inverse of everything that's there,
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:04.020]   the inverse of everything that's there,
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:05.620]   including alcohol intake,
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:10.740]   which is robust on "The Simpsons."
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:11.580]   - Yeah, right.
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:12.900]   - But interesting.
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:17.260]   So, and when it comes to food sourcing,
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:20.260]   like non-fruit, non-vegetable food sourcing,
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:21.700]   is there anything we can do?
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:24.740]   I mean, it's so hard for people to get eggs from farms.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:26.340]   I mean, you can if you go to a farmer's market,
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:29.540]   but this stuff can get pretty tricky, pretty expensive.
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:32.660]   And most people listening are not gonna be
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:35.300]   living in Sonoma where they might have a neighbor
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:36.780]   that has chickens or something.
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:37.620]   - Yeah.
[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:40.500]   - It's a hard problem.
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:41.740]   - It is a hard problem.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:46.740]   And I think maybe people asking for it more would help.
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:48.300]   I don't know.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:50.220]   I mean, in San Francisco, I'm lucky
[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:54.340]   'cause I can just get, you know, just on the phone,
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:57.540]   fresh, direct order, and I know it's okay.
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:00.620]   But I know that's not the case everywhere.
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:05.620]   So I think being aware, honestly, is a really big step.
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:10.100]   If you're aware that this is something you want to change,
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:12.540]   you will find ways to change it.
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:14.300]   - It's interesting because a few years back,
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:18.780]   there was a lot of discussion about dyes in children's toys,
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:22.340]   in particular toys from overseas, right?
[01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:23.260]   Remember, kids are not,
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:25.660]   young babies are always gnawing on stuff and teething.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:27.020]   And there was a lot of attention,
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:28.700]   like, "Hey, what's in these sippy cups?"
[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:31.380]   And my understanding is, toys and sippy cups,
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:32.820]   and my understanding is that BPAs
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.500]   were banned from sippy cups.
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:35.340]   - Phthalates.
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:36.300]   - Phthalates, excuse me.
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:37.140]   - Based on my work.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:37.960]   - Based on your work.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:38.800]   Thank you so much.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.500]   Thank you for the clarification, truly,
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:43.020]   and for the work that led to that.
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:47.740]   We have this innate, thankfully,
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:50.580]   innate reflex to protect our young,
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:55.100]   as does most every species, thank goodness.
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:57.900]   And we know that baby skin
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:00.180]   is more absorbent than older skin, we know.
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:02.580]   And so there are literally laws in place
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:04.540]   and restrictions in place to make sure
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.860]   that this stuff is minimized in young kids.
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:09.380]   But then we sort of, after age 12,
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:11.020]   we're kind of like, "Okay, well, it's a free-for-all.
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:12.220]   "It depends on your budget, where you go."
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:15.840]   And so we can't rely on governing bodies to do this.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.660]   But I think it's a useful conversation,
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:22.060]   especially given your relationship to Scandinavia,
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:24.380]   which is a fun one to elaborate on,
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.540]   to illustrate some of the discrepancy
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:30.360]   between the US and Europe.
[01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:37.260]   What sorts of chemicals are banned in Europe,
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:40.740]   in food, in lotions, et cetera,
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:44.900]   that you're aware of that are prominent here in the US?
[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:46.020]   Maybe that's a good filter
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:48.100]   to play some of this choice-making through.
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:52.900]   Europe has had a policy called REACH.
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:56.500]   And under REACH, you have to show
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:57.700]   that a chemical is safe
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:59.660]   before it's put into the marketplace.
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:04.380]   Not, I mean, so the way our system is here
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:06.220]   is put in the marketplace,
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:08.860]   and then if somebody gets worried about it,
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:12.700]   they might do a study, they might find harm.
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:15.660]   Remember how long it took me to find that phthalate connection?
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:18.160]   It was 10 years, two studies, 10 years,
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.820]   $10 million, by the way.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:22.400]   So if you're gonna wait for that,
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.700]   I don't know, given the number of chemicals out there,
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:29.620]   80,000 or more, forget it.
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:33.340]   So I think the REACH policy of testing
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:35.180]   before something's put in the market
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:38.020]   is making a big difference in Europe.
[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:41.820]   I think that's one reason why they're much better off.
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:44.820]   - Are those animal tests or animal and human tests
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:45.780]   that they're doing over there?
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:47.260]   - Whatever defines safety.
[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:48.540]   It depends on the chemical.
[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:50.920]   It depends on what the product is.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.840]   I can't answer that in general.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.160]   - So that might be a good avenue
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.620]   for changing legislature here, right?
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:59.500]   To install something similar to REACH.
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:02.740]   - Absolutely, but it's not gonna happen, I don't think.
[01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:03.580]   - No? - No.
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.500]   Because there's too many forces against that.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:09.860]   It's very, very hard for manufacturers to make changes.
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.320]   I'll give you one example.
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:16.260]   So you know that, you might not know, but should know,
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:19.400]   that phthalates are very prevalent in the hospital setting.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:25.580]   If you think of a tube to dialysis, to chemotherapy, to IV,
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:28.700]   it's all plas, that's all phthalates, right?
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:30.820]   And that's going into your body.
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:35.300]   And there was a recently, a bill passed in California
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:37.900]   that DEHP could not be in IV bags.
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:40.380]   It's fantastic, a success.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.300]   - In the actual bag? - Yes.
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:45.020]   - The bags could not contain these endocrine disruptors?
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:47.500]   - Yes, DEHP specifically. - DEHP, okay.
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:50.780]   - Diethylhexyl phthalate, the most antiandrogenic phthalate.
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:53.340]   So that was a great step forward,
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:55.840]   but that's like one chemical, right?
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:44:00.380]   In one product, and that was a battle.
[01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:05.380]   So you see how hard it is to do this, extremely hard.
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:10.260]   There's a company, B. Braun, which makes hospital products,
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:13.100]   and they are very forward-thinking,
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:16.800]   and they set up a factory in Florida
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.540]   to make alternative IV bags
[01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:22.900]   out of another product, polyolefin.
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:26.780]   And the problem is that we're not sure
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:28.900]   about the safety of polyolefin.
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:30.980]   So it gets really difficult.
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.460]   You can say remove DEHP,
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:36.420]   but now we scientists have to say,
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:39.540]   what does it mean for a chemical to be safe?
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:40.840]   And we don't know that.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:44.580]   I don't mean to disillusion you and your listeners,
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:48.220]   but that's a huge challenge that we're up against.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:50.980]   We know it's safer, we know it's safer,
[01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:52.660]   and we know what the bad actors are,
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:55.020]   and we know the things we don't want to be exposed to,
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:57.380]   but we have to be careful when we think
[01:44:57.380 --> 01:44:59.820]   about what do we want to put in instead.
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:04.020]   - Yeah, I'm thinking about this.
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:07.360]   A former president of Stanford,
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.360]   who has also happened to be a family friend years ago,
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:13.180]   he's since passed, Don Kennedy,
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:17.260]   when he retired as president of Stanford went in,
[01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:20.180]   my understanding is that he went and directed the FDA.
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.260]   And I was just thinking to myself,
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:24.260]   like, when did this happen?
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:27.020]   Because I know he was super into health.
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:28.400]   He was like an avid runner.
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:30.740]   He was very fit, well into his seventies.
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.100]   Yeah, hip replacement, kept running,
[01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:33.500]   or maybe it was knee replacement, I don't know.
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:34.900]   The guy was obsessed with health.
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:39.540]   And so I don't think that there's a lack of interest
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:42.680]   in health at the level of it was like the FDA.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.940]   And, but there's clearly a problem.
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:50.580]   And I'm just trying to think of solutions.
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:52.500]   And it seems to all boil down
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:56.340]   to what we can take control of in our home.
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:57.460]   Like when we go to a restaurant,
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:46:00.380]   it's challenging to know what they're doing in the kitchen.
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:04.060]   And at some point it becomes neurotic to, you know.
[01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:05.740]   Although I know people that won't go to restaurants
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:06.700]   where they use seed oils.
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:08.060]   There's this whole new thing cropping up
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:10.380]   about avoiding seed oils,
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:13.960]   but maybe they're more significant issues, who knows?
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:17.620]   The seed oil crowd is pretty intense.
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:19.920]   And I like olive oil anyway, so I err to that.
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.140]   But I think if people are interested
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:25.500]   in limiting their exposure to these endocrine disruptors,
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.420]   one of the key questions that's gonna come up again
[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:30.100]   and again, especially in light of PCOS and sperm counts
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:34.060]   is we can't control what happened to us during pregnancy.
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:37.500]   But once we have some sense of agency
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:38.820]   over what we put into our body
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.700]   and how we put it into our body,
[01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:43.820]   do you think that there's a,
[01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:49.460]   that there's plasticity and resilience to this system?
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:51.760]   So, you know, God forbid if somebody was exposed
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.140]   to a lot of these things early on, can they, you know,
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:57.720]   by making changes, can they rescue themselves
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:58.560]   to any degree?
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:46:59.380]   No? - No.
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:01.760]   - So it's really just dependent on what your parents did.
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:05.440]   - Yes, that's not to say that your own exposure
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:07.780]   cannot change things further and make things worse.
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:10.480]   But here's a fact.
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:15.480]   If a male's mother smokes when he's in the womb,
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.980]   then he has a, this is a Danish study, by the way,
[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:22.180]   50% reduction in sperm count.
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:23.820]   - If his mother smoked while he was in the womb,
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:25.420]   how much smoking are we talking?
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:27.220]   - I don't know, I don't remember.
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:30.140]   But the reason I bring this up is because
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:34.180]   there's nothing he can do to change that, okay?
[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:36.500]   If he smokes as an adult,
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:39.620]   he has, I think, a similar reduction in the sperm count.
[01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:43.420]   He can stop and his sperm will be restored.
[01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:45.240]   He can get his sperm health back.
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:47.480]   But whatever happened in the womb stays in the womb,
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:48.940]   if you will, so to speak.
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:50.140]   It's developmental.
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:54.180]   It's not going to, you know, it's gonna be there for life.
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:55.880]   And that's true of the brain as well.
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:00.880]   So I think anybody who's thinking of conceiving a pregnancy
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:07.220]   or pregnant has a responsibility to really learn
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:09.500]   how to reduce their exposure.
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:10.900]   Because these things are, by the way,
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:12.860]   passed on for several generations.
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:15.340]   It's your child and your child's child,
[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:19.040]   because the germ cells for your grandchild
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:22.080]   are going to be carried in within your child.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.300]   - So germ cells are not germs as in infectious germs.
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:28.980]   It's the cells that will produce the egg and sperm,
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:31.940]   that germinate, hence the word germ.
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:34.420]   - So it's a huge responsibility.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:36.980]   And I think people should take it very seriously,
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:40.580]   that they have, you know,
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:42.920]   they're going to be affecting the health
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.060]   of subsequent generations.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:45.940]   Some labs say it's seven generations.
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:46.940]   I don't know if that's true,
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:50.420]   but certainly three generations are affected.
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:53.700]   And so I should mention my book.
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:54.620]   Can I mention that? - Yeah, please.
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:55.460]   I'll mention it.
[01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:57.780]   Yeah, I believe I mentioned it in my introduction.
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:58.600]   - Yeah. - Yeah, please.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:02.460]   - So in "Countdown," two words, by the way,
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:05.020]   'cause if you say "Countdown" one word, you won't find it.
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:08.740]   But "Countdown," we have two chapters
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:10.060]   on things you can do.
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:11.740]   Very practical things you can do.
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:14.600]   And also websites you can go to and links you can go to.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:18.820]   Now this came out a while ago, so '21.
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:20.820]   So there are many more things now,
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:22.920]   but I think it's a good start.
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:26.900]   - How lonely are you in this expedition
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:31.260]   of identifying endocrine disruptors in food,
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:35.340]   in pesticides, in the sorts of things you're talking about?
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:38.620]   Like, is there a whole field of this, of excellent people?
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:43.620]   Are you a small team of people that are against the grain?
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:46.700]   I mean, I confess I don't know many people
[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:48.020]   doing the sorts of work that you're doing,
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:51.180]   but you're the most public-facing and prominent.
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:54.940]   And I guess my question is like,
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:57.860]   is the NIH funding a lot of this sort of thing?
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.380]   - Absolutely.
[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:02.400]   We're an army and it's international.
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:06.980]   And there is now a global plastics treaty
[01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:08.900]   under negotiation, by the way.
[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:10.860]   - Tell us about the plastics treaty.
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:15.180]   - People are trying to create,
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:17.900]   get passed by various countries
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:20.620]   an international plastics treaty.
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:22.540]   I can't, I don't want to talk a lot about it.
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:23.820]   I'm not involved in that process,
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:28.820]   but in the process you could see, if you looked into there,
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:33.420]   hundreds of scientists and concerned citizens
[01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:38.260]   and activists and people in legislation
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:41.300]   who are working to specifically
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:42.660]   on the chemicals in plastic.
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:45.320]   Now, plastic is really a bad actor,
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:48.700]   but it is not the only bad actor.
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:52.340]   So I want to just mention that plastic is really important,
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:55.940]   but pesticides are not plastic and so on.
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:57.420]   So there are many other classes
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:50:58.380]   that you have to worry about,
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:03.140]   but certainly controlling our exposure to plastic is huge.
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:07.260]   And you asked about scientists in this area.
[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:11.500]   Yes, there's a huge amount of science going on for this,
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:14.540]   in this, there's, and it's funded by NIH
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:19.540]   and it's funded by the EU and primarily,
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:22.260]   I think those are the two funders of Scandinavia
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:26.900]   has funding within, in Scandinavian countries.
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:28.340]   So there's a lot of work
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:31.180]   and a lot of very good people working really hard,
[01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:32.460]   but it's a huge problem.
[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:35.060]   And it's been here since,
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:40.100]   well, plastic started to rise in popularity in 1950.
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:43.660]   So we have like 75 years to battle against
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.900]   and it's not going down anytime soon.
[01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:50.020]   - Lifespan is increasing pretty significantly,
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:51.980]   presumably in large part
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:53.980]   because of the reduction in smoking.
[01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:56.540]   - And control of infectious disease.
[01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:59.220]   - And control of infectious diseases.
[01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:02.020]   But lifespan is definitely increasing,
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:07.100]   whereas the use of plastics has clearly increased.
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:11.940]   And so I guess one could argue that we're living longer,
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:15.300]   but we are less robust than we were,
[01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:18.620]   less reproductively competent.
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:19.460]   Is that-
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:22.940]   - The people that are reflected in that long lifespan
[01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:26.260]   were not necessarily exposed early in life,
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:28.660]   which is when it's most critical.
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:31.300]   So, you know, I was born in 1936,
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:33.140]   there was no plastic then.
[01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:35.100]   There was no, you know,
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:37.100]   and there were other things of course,
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:39.820]   but not as they are today.
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:44.700]   So I don't think that you can make the inference
[01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:46.500]   that because we're living longer,
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:48.340]   plastic growth, you know,
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:49.740]   the growth of the plastics industry
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:51.540]   is somehow driving that longevity.
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:52.780]   Absolutely not.
[01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:53.620]   Absolutely not.
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:56.820]   I think what it's driving is decrease in fertility.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:00.500]   And what's happening is that the shift in populations
[01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:01.340]   is pretty dramatic.
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:04.420]   We're getting, you know, the pyramid used to be like this.
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:07.420]   I'm making a triangle with my arms
[01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:09.180]   showing very few people on top
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:10.620]   and a lot of people on the bottom.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:13.860]   But what's happening is that that's getting inverted.
[01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:15.660]   So we're getting more and more people on top
[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:17.780]   and fewer and fewer people on the bottom.
[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:18.940]   - Birth rates are way down.
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:20.380]   - Birth rates are way down.
[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:25.060]   And so this is an enormous problem for societies
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:28.020]   because the people in that small support group
[01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:31.620]   at the bottom can't drive the society
[01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:36.420]   to support the large growth on top.
[01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:37.260]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:38.260]   - Is this true in other countries as well?
[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:39.340]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:40.180]   Absolutely.
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.340]   It's all over the world.
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:46.340]   And the decline in fertility in my mind is probably,
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:50.580]   well, one of the biggest challenges we're facing now
[01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:53.620]   because it's everywhere.
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:55.180]   It's very acute.
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:54:00.180]   And there's only limited things we can do to counter it.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:06.220]   There's a wonderful website, it's by the World Bank,
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:07.460]   put out by the World Bank.
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:09.540]   It's called Fertility Data.
[01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:11.060]   And if you go in there,
[01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:14.500]   you can see what is the fertility rate every year,
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:19.180]   but you can plug in a country or a year
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:21.980]   and see what the fertility rate in each country
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:22.900]   in the world each year.
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:23.740]   And you can see that.
[01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:27.820]   And what you see is that a decline,
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:30.180]   about the same rate as sperm decline, by the way,
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:33.460]   about 50% in 50 years.
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:38.460]   And the critical point for fertility is two.
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:41.060]   So what's that mean?
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:42.340]   That's called replacement.
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:45.020]   And that's two people replace themselves
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:46.700]   with a total fertility rate of two.
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:49.180]   Actually, 2.1, because you have a little bit of loss,
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:52.420]   but 2.1, you're good to go, society.
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:54.980]   When you fall below that, you're shrinking.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:57.780]   And there are many countries in the world
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:01.060]   that are below that, including the United States.
[01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:04.140]   And for example, the worst I've seen
[01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:09.140]   is actually South Korea, which is at 0.78.
[01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:11.180]   Japan is at one.
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:14.260]   So large parts of the world
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:17.480]   are just not replacing themselves.
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:20.580]   And why that is, is maybe another discussion,
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.620]   or we can talk about it.
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:22.820]   I don't know if you wanna go into that,
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:26.180]   but it's not just sperm count, for sure.
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:27.460]   - Yeah, along those lines,
[01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:30.620]   let's talk about egg count and quality.
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:33.540]   You mentioned the PCOS results earlier.
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:35.700]   Before we were on, Mike,
[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:38.220]   you mentioned an interesting study that you did
[01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:41.300]   about the use of electric blankets
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:43.700]   and assessing whether or not the use of electric blankets
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:47.100]   had impacted egg number or quality in women.
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:48.360]   And the answer was?
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.100]   - Actually, what we looked at in women,
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:52.220]   I'm sorry to correct you,
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:54.940]   but it was the outcome of their pregnancy,
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:57.420]   their fertility, and if they got pregnant,
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:55:58.780]   how did that turn out?
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:01.220]   - Excuse me, so thank you for that clarification.
[01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:04.220]   - But I'm sure there'd be a lot of other studies
[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:05.300]   that have looked at that.
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:07.780]   I just have been away from that field for a long time.
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:10.980]   But so far, I don't see convincing evidence
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:13.260]   that the use of cell phones
[01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:18.260]   or other exposures to electromagnetic radiation
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:21.060]   are affecting our pregnancies and our fertility.
[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:23.180]   That's not to say it's not happening,
[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:25.520]   but I have not looked at it.
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:27.980]   And I don't like to make statements
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:29.900]   about things I haven't looked at.
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:31.980]   - My understanding of the cell phone data
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:36.900]   for sperm count and motility, aka quality,
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:41.100]   is I discussed a meta-analysis covering this
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:42.480]   on the podcast previously,
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:45.740]   is that there are some heat effects of cell phone use
[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:47.180]   and keeping the phone in the pocket
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:49.820]   that may, I want to be careful here,
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:54.660]   impact sperm count and motility quality,
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:58.940]   but direct effects of EMFs on sperm,
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:02.460]   there's no evidence that it is disrupting sperm,
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:03.300]   at least to my knowledge.
[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:04.620]   - I honestly have to say,
[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:06.500]   just going to say I don't know,
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:10.220]   but I do know that heat is related
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:12.100]   to fertility and sperm count.
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:16.700]   And you can look at the birth rates
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:19.260]   as a function of the month of conception,
[01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:20.860]   and you can see that, for example,
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:25.100]   in warm months, in warm climates, there's less.
[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:27.260]   So heat does play a role,
[01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:29.940]   but how much that's tied to cell phone use,
[01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:33.460]   I think that's something that's now under investigation
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:36.460]   by a lot of groups, and we'll see what they find.
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:39.180]   - Yeah, the data on sitting more than a few hours a day,
[01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:42.060]   on having legs that are very large
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:43.540]   as a consequence of obesity,
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:47.260]   or even just legs that are large, heating the scrotum,
[01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:51.340]   those data are fairly, I would say, solid
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:54.260]   in terms of the relationship to reducing sperm count.
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:55.860]   Heat is not good for sperm,
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:59.620]   which is why the scrotum has the features that it does
[01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:03.360]   to move the testicles further or closer to the body.
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:06.800]   Getting back to egg count and quality,
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:07.700]   there's some evidence
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:12.380]   that girls are entering puberty earlier,
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:14.940]   but that women are also undergoing
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:16.740]   perimenopause menopause earlier.
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:18.180]   - Earlier, that's right.
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:20.900]   - Do we know what that is the consequence of?
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:22.940]   - There are several new papers actually
[01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:26.460]   on the menopausal age showing relation
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:27.540]   to a number of chemicals,
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:30.220]   but I can't quote them to you right now.
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:33.940]   I don't remember which class it was that they looked at,
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.980]   but I think that's right.
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:38.300]   I think there is growing evidence
[01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:41.740]   that earlier, fewer...
[01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:45.140]   It's also called premature ovarian failure,
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:49.280]   so that women are just not producing the eggs
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:50.820]   as long as they used to.
[01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:57.500]   I just want to say something about the fertility.
[01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:58.740]   Can we go back to fertility?
[01:58:58.740 --> 01:58:59.860]   - Please.
[01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:02.740]   - So when this comes up,
[01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:04.420]   and I'm sure you've seen the literature,
[01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:06.280]   there's a lot of literature on this,
[01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:09.960]   that say fertility is going down,
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:11.460]   fewer children are being born.
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:13.980]   A, people say, well, that's a good thing
[01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:15.700]   'cause it's less of a load on the planet,
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:17.580]   which is another discussion.
[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:21.380]   And then they say, well, this is due to choice,
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:24.320]   that people are choosing to have fewer children
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:28.460]   and they're choosing to delay childbearing
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:30.660]   till they're no longer as fertile.
[01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:32.860]   They're using more contraception.
[01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:34.300]   Women are more educated.
[01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.100]   They're entering the workforce.
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:39.660]   All of these social factors are given
[01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:43.140]   as the reason for decline in fertility.
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:47.340]   And I just need to point out,
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:48.860]   whenever I hear this,
[01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:53.540]   that it's not just human fertility that's declining.
[01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:58.180]   The number of species that are becoming extinct
[01:59:58.180 --> 02:00:00.240]   is increasing rapidly,
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:05.240]   and there have been, for at least 40 years,
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:08.060]   evidence that those pesticides that affect us
[02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:09.780]   are affecting animals as well.
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:14.780]   And so the decline in fertility in non-human species
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:19.260]   cannot be attributed to delayed childbearing
[02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:21.300]   or use of contraception.
[02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:23.640]   - Or rent crisis, right?
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:28.100]   And it's interesting because we usually hear first
[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:29.940]   about species that are about to go extinct,
[02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:31.620]   that are badly endangered.
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:32.800]   I don't know what the proper language is,
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:34.440]   but it's about to go distinct.
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.820]   Like the Florida panther.
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:39.980]   Or we hear that there are these species
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:42.900]   that there's a very small subset of them left.
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:45.020]   The black-footed ferrets in Montana,
[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:48.540]   I think one ferret, his name is Scarface,
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:50.380]   sired something like 300 litters
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:51.740]   that then led to the,
[02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:53.580]   eventually they started out breeding,
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:54.740]   'cause if you do too much inbreeding,
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:56.180]   obviously it's not good.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:58.760]   But then they were able to at least partially recover,
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:01.180]   maybe fully recover those populations.
[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:05.300]   And people forget the domino effect of these ecosystems
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:06.900]   when one species is compromised.
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:08.940]   Like when the black-footed ferrets,
[02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:10.140]   I know it might sound kind of silly,
[02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:14.100]   but were compromised in terms of their populations,
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:16.260]   the prairie dog population went up,
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:18.420]   the grasses were getting eaten far more.
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:20.780]   And then there's all these downstream consequences
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:23.820]   on bugs and I'm not an expert in this,
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:25.620]   but one doesn't have to be an expert to understand,
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:30.200]   you move one pin here and the whole web moves.
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:35.200]   And so, or you move one node and the whole web reconfigures.
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.660]   And that's what nature has been doing
[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:41.120]   for millions of years, right?
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:45.800]   But at some point it is conceivable, no pun intended,
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:48.560]   that we are going to be the species
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.400]   on the endangered species list, right?
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:53.720]   I mean, that's not like an outrageous sci-fi movie.
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:54.560]   - No, that's right.
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:56.400]   - Like at some point humans might be added
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:57.240]   to the endangered species list.
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:00.600]   - With the exception that we have, we're very clever.
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:02.540]   And so we found a lot of ways
[02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:07.160]   to do medically assisted conception.
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:11.800]   - Right, ICSI, the literally gentle grabbing of one sperm
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:16.800]   and forcing it to fertilize the egg
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:19.460]   is something we've covered on this podcast
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:22.000]   in our fertility episode with Natalie Crawford
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.500]   and a solo episode that I did.
[02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:26.180]   There are questions that people have,
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:27.720]   reasonable questions about whether or not
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:30.980]   the offspring of those types of scenarios
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:35.980]   are the same as the genetic probability experiment,
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:39.940]   as you mentioned before, of having 200 million sperm
[02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:42.100]   and then letting nature select the one
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:45.220]   that is most robust in that environment.
[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:50.140]   - Yeah, and the number of technologies is increasing.
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:52.400]   We're a very clever species.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:54.580]   And for example,
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:57.740]   I don't know if you've heard of gametogenesis.
[02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:02.260]   So it is now possible to create an embryo
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:06.380]   from a skin cell.
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:11.380]   A skin cell can produce a sperm cell and an egg cell.
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:13.900]   - You give it the right transcription factors
[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:15.340]   and you can-
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:18.420]   - So this is kind of interesting, exciting and scary.
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:20.660]   - This is like the, what is it?
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:23.100]   I think the vultures, the females,
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:26.440]   there's some way in which two female vultures
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.440]   or maybe a single female vulture
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:32.280]   can create offspring in the absence of a male.
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:33.960]   There's also a three-party IVF.
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:35.880]   I don't know if you're aware of this.
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:39.720]   This was developed where there's a mitochondrial disease.
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:43.980]   You can take the two eggs, one from the intended mother,
[02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:46.160]   you take the nucleus, so you get the DNA,
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:48.760]   you put it into an egg of somebody
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:51.200]   that where the DNA has been removed,
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:54.120]   but where the spindles, which are rich with mitochondria
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:57.560]   are from a typically a much younger host,
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:03:58.680]   and then you use a sperm.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:00.000]   So it's actually three parents.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.200]   It's the spindle of one mom,
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.440]   the DNA of another mom and a sperm.
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:05.760]   They do this in the UK for mitochondrial disease.
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:07.480]   It's still illegal in the United States,
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:08.960]   as far as I understand.
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:11.320]   And it's done in other countries.
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:12.600]   And in theory-
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:14.400]   - Legal issues must be.
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:18.380]   - Yeah, but in theory, this would allow women of any age,
[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:21.860]   provided they still have eggs,
[02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:25.400]   to have their DNA propagated forward
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:28.560]   because the DNA can be put into a younger egg
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:31.800]   that has the spindle quality
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:35.200]   that allows for the production of more cells.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:38.160]   I mean, this can and has been done in humans.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.120]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:43.160]   - So we're, I mean, you and I won't think
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:45.360]   of all the things that will be developed
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:49.940]   in the next 10, 20 years to meet the challenge
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:54.220]   of declining fertility by ordinary conception.
[02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:56.460]   I mean, I think that's how we're gonna solve
[02:04:56.460 --> 02:04:57.340]   this problem for us.
[02:04:57.340 --> 02:04:59.100]   We're going to just be smarter and smarter
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:02.720]   about how to do a medically-assisted conception.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:09.700]   And then the question is going to be,
[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:11.280]   and it'll take time to know this,
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:15.620]   is whether there are effects in the offspring,
[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:17.280]   adverse effects in the offspring.
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:21.740]   It's a little tricky because, for example,
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:24.340]   if you use the sperm of an infertile couple
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:27.700]   and you see, let's say the son is subfertile,
[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:29.340]   that's born that way,
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.980]   but you do it in a test tube or whatever.
[02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:36.100]   And then you can say, well, maybe that's
[02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:37.380]   because the father was infertile
[02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:40.380]   and he's got inheritance from the father from that.
[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:41.440]   You know what I'm saying?
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:44.480]   So you can't know whether the,
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:47.040]   if you see an adverse effect in an offspring,
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:49.840]   you have to be very careful that it's not something
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:52.040]   that they've gotten because of problems
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:55.920]   that led the couple to seek assisted reproduction.
[02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:57.000]   You see, you following me?
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:57.840]   - Yep. - Yeah.
[02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:02.260]   - Super challenging, fascinating problem.
[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:06.080]   So in anticipation of this sit down together,
[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:12.100]   I put a question out on X, formerly known as Twitter.
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:16.300]   I let people know that I was hosting an expert
[02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:21.300]   in endocrine disruptors, in phthalates and pesticides,
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:24.260]   reproductive implications, et cetera.
[02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:28.180]   And I asked for questions and they came up
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:30.780]   with a huge number of excellent questions,
[02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:32.260]   many of which you've already answered.
[02:06:32.260 --> 02:06:35.460]   Things like, is tap water safe?
[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:36.620]   What can we do to our tap water?
[02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:38.580]   You mentioned you distill water.
[02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:40.460]   My understanding is that reverse osmosis
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:44.320]   provided there's remineralization, excuse me,
[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:47.620]   difficult word to say, can also be effective, et cetera.
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:50.820]   There were a lot of questions about cosmetics
[02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:52.280]   and laundry detergents.
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:55.880]   I don't know if we discussed laundry detergents.
[02:06:55.880 --> 02:06:58.900]   What do you use in terms of laundry detergent?
[02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:02.000]   Or that is presumably one can find-
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.500]   - I don't even remember. (laughs)
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:04.660]   - Okay.
[02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:05.900]   - Don't go by my products.
[02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:07.080]   - Okay.
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:09.940]   - For one thing, I'm not gonna be pregnant anytime soon.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:17.060]   - I believe there are some solutions related to the,
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:21.020]   like instead of bleach, people can use hydrogen peroxide.
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:24.300]   - I can't speak about specific products, actually.
[02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:25.860]   You know, I can tell you who can.
[02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:27.340]   Maybe you might like to talk to her.
[02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:29.780]   So you remember I mentioned Million Marker,
[02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:31.320]   the company that did the inventory?
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:33.620]   Not the company, well, they are a company, but.
[02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:36.340]   So they, look at Million Marker.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.900]   I think you'd be interested.
[02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:38.740]   - Okay.
[02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:41.020]   - Yeah, and the person who runs that,
[02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:46.020]   Jenna Wah, is a Chinese-American who,
[02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:48.100]   and a friend of mine, and we're gonna be
[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:50.060]   writing a grant together.
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:52.440]   And she participated in the film.
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:54.580]   So our participants sent their,
[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:58.460]   so if you go to Million Marker, you log on,
[02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:02.820]   and if you agree to pay whatever it is, $199, I think,
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:05.100]   you send your urine in, they give you a kit,
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:06.740]   you send your urine in, and they test it
[02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:07.820]   for all these things in your urine.
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:09.180]   So you know what's in your body.
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:10.020]   You might want to think about it.
[02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:11.280]   It might be interesting.
[02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:13.800]   And then if you pay another 100, I think,
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.940]   you get this counseling and so on, blah, blah.
[02:08:16.940 --> 02:08:18.820]   So you can see the different levels.
[02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:21.160]   But she knows all about products.
[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.980]   I don't know about products, 'cause it's a moving target.
[02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:27.340]   And also, I don't like to talk about product names,
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:29.900]   because it sounds like I'm endorsing them, so.
[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:32.900]   - Right, and we won't expect you to give product names,
[02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:36.340]   and I'll follow your recommendation that you just gave.
[02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:38.500]   Somebody asked about food dyes,
[02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:40.260]   just generally, the dyes in foods.
[02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:42.460]   I saw an incredible study recently
[02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:44.020]   that Science Magazine covered.
[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:46.700]   So Science Magazine, very reputable, of course.
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:50.100]   Yellow number five, I forget what the precise name is,
[02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:52.320]   but the thing that makes Cheetos really bright.
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:55.140]   They put it on the bellies of adult mice,
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:58.780]   and it literally makes them translucent.
[02:08:58.780 --> 02:08:59.620]   - Oh, yeah, I saw that.
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:00.460]   - You can see the organs.
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:01.300]   - I saw that.
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:02.580]   - It's wild. - It's scary.
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:03.460]   - It's so scary.
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:06.260]   I sent it to Rogan, and he, I won't,
[02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:09.420]   he was like, "Whoa," his version of "Whoa."
[02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:11.420]   I was like, I also said, "Whoa."
[02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:13.820]   - He probably said, "Holy shit," right?
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:15.300]   - No, he said. - Or worse.
[02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:17.100]   - No, no, I'm not gonna say what it said,
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:18.460]   but it wasn't, he didn't curse.
[02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:21.080]   There were a number of questions about household items.
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:23.880]   Again, we're not looking for specific products,
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:27.940]   but for instance, soaps, body wash,
[02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:29.900]   cleaning sprays, floor cleaners,
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:31.360]   laundry-related cleaners,
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:36.180]   do any or all of these contain endocrine disruptors,
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:40.280]   unless one is careful to find the ones that don't, okay.
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:42.480]   Receipts, how serious is it?
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:44.180]   Should we be concerned about the BPAs
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:46.780]   and other endocrine disruptors on receipts?
[02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:49.460]   - Yes, and my suggestion is
[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:51.260]   just ask for an electronic receipt,
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:54.820]   and then you don't have to deal with it, yeah.
[02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:57.980]   But they're definitely absorbed into your body.
[02:09:57.980 --> 02:10:01.820]   - Any impact of endocrine disruptors
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:04.620]   of the sort we've talked about today on the thyroid system?
[02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:06.060]   - Yes.
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:08.200]   - Presumably in the bad direction.
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:09.900]   - Yeah, I mean, this is an interesting point.
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:11.700]   Let me just say another word about it.
[02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:16.700]   So there was an ongoing study
[02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:20.940]   in the Faroe Islands off of Denmark,
[02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:24.420]   and they studied PFAS chemicals,
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:28.380]   and showed that people who fished there,
[02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:30.980]   there were fisher people, and they ate the fish,
[02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:34.500]   and they were getting high levels of PFAS in their body,
[02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:37.740]   and had, and this is published,
[02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:40.620]   effects on their immune response.
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:44.520]   So my concern, and I don't know if anyone's looked at this,
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:47.860]   is given everyone's vaccination,
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:53.100]   is our response to vaccination now altered
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:54.500]   by these chemicals, I don't know.
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:56.660]   But I think it's a really interesting question.
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:58.740]   But there is a whole field of the effect
[02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:01.020]   of these chemicals on the thyroid system,
[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:04.340]   and there's a lot of evidence that it's adverse.
[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:08.260]   - Can these endocrine disruptors be detoxed from the body?
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.460]   Is there anything that we can do?
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:10.940]   What's the quickest ways?
[02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:12.220]   Things like sweating.
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:15.200]   Are there ways to improve liver clearance
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:17.660]   of these endocrine disruptors?
[02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:19.700]   - The answer to that depends on the class of chemicals.
[02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:22.660]   So the chemicals that are water-soluble,
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:26.300]   in particular the phthalates and the bisphenols,
[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:29.340]   leave the body in a matter of hours.
[02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:30.300]   You don't have to do anything.
[02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:34.780]   You just have to stop taking them in, right?
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:38.740]   The forever chemicals, the PFAS chemicals,
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:42.940]   pesticides are, and though,
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:45.540]   so it has to do with how they're handled by the body.
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:48.880]   Are they put into the, if they're water-soluble,
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:49.820]   you pee them out.
[02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:51.860]   If they're fat-soluble,
[02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:53.460]   they're gonna be around for a long time.
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:55.460]   So it just depends on the chemical structure
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:58.160]   of the compound.
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:00.700]   - There was a question about nonstick pans.
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:01.580]   You covered that earlier.
[02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:03.740]   If someone had to pick between nonstick coated pans
[02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:06.260]   versus seasoned iron pans.
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:07.940]   - No question, iron.
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:11.380]   There's no risk associated with seasoned iron pans.
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:13.500]   - A number of other questions,
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:17.580]   such as why does Europe have such more stringent laws,
[02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:21.040]   et cetera, lots of questions about atrazine,
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:24.740]   questions about ointments and fragrances you've covered.
[02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:29.740]   And I must say that as I scroll through these hundreds
[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:31.320]   of questions, if not more,
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:37.740]   you've done an amazing job at clarifying for us
[02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:41.920]   what's known, what is not known,
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:45.760]   and essentially where it's a probably should avoid,
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:49.660]   definitely avoid, and look, we just don't know.
[02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:53.640]   - I have to distinguish between we just don't know
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:55.120]   and I just don't know.
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:57.320]   I mean, there are many things that I don't know.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:12:58.640]   (laughing)
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:12:59.560]   It's a huge field.
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:04.560]   So maybe with some, ask the question of CHAT-GPT.
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:09.440]   - Yeah, we'll be certain to ask CHAT-GPT
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:14.440]   and we will be certain to ask other experts in these areas.
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:18.420]   But I just want to make very clear,
[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:22.000]   I and everyone listening and watching
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.360]   truly appreciate the work that you've been doing
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:26.580]   in this area for a number of years.
[02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:28.960]   We're so grateful that you took that airline flight
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:32.520]   with this chemist that you mentioned,
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:37.320]   that you stored the urine of those pregnant women,
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:41.360]   that you analyzed it and that you've gone down this path
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:44.320]   of exploring things that are really disruptive
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:47.120]   to our health and potentially to the existence
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:51.920]   of our species as, you know, as we talked about earlier,
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:54.960]   there is the possibility that we go extinct,
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.000]   not because of a meteor,
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.400]   but because we fail to replace ourselves
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:00.120]   and that we fail to replace ourselves
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:02.960]   because we destroy our biological ability
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:04.320]   to replace ourselves.
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:07.400]   I think it's hard for people to internalize
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:09.120]   that very real possibility
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:11.200]   because we feel ourselves sitting in traffic
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:12.720]   with thousands of other people and go,
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:14.160]   there's too many people, right?
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:15.000]   This kind of thing.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:19.560]   But I want to thank you for the work that you've been doing
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:22.680]   and continue to do for your willingness to write books
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:25.800]   and to educate the public on podcasts like this and others,
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:27.580]   because these are topics
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:31.160]   that are pretty emotionally loaded for people.
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:34.100]   I don't think anything gets people quite as inflamed
[02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:37.940]   as the idea that what they've been ingesting and exposed to,
[02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:40.360]   especially in terms of consumables
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:42.500]   that they've spent their hard-earned money on,
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:46.080]   have been harming them and their offspring
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:48.240]   and generations to follow,
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:51.520]   that there's something that really lands deep in that way.
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:54.440]   But you've also offered us a lot of possibility
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:57.000]   and a sense of agency over these things.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.480]   And I love that you weave your math and statistics
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:05.120]   and probability theory background into all of this
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:08.580]   because what comes through is intense curiosity,
[02:15:08.580 --> 02:15:11.720]   intense rigor, and a real desire to do good.
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:13.760]   So thank you so much for joining us.
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.000]   And please come back again as you make more discoveries.
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.280]   Thank you. - It's been really fun.
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:20.480]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:22.200]   with Dr. Shauna Swan.
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:23.480]   To learn more about her work
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:26.400]   and to find a link to her excellent books on these topics,
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:28.920]   please see the links in the show note captions.
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:31.000]   Also, I should mention that if you're interested
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.080]   in learning more about microplastics
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:34.400]   and endocrine disruptors,
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:36.780]   I did a solo episode of the Huberman Lab podcast
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:37.620]   on that topic,
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:40.520]   and that is also linked in the show note captions.
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:42.920]   If you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:45.000]   please subscribe to our YouTube channel.

[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:04.880]   Also, if you have any questions for me
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:06.520]   or comments about the podcast
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:08.440]   or guests or topics that you'd like me to consider
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:09.940]   for the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:16:09.940 --> 02:16:12.360]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:14.180]   I do read all the comments.
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:15.320]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:16.520]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:18.120]   It's my very first book.
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:19.520]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:21.680]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:22.860]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:24.000]   for more than five years,
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.340]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:27.880]   of research and experience.
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:30.940]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:33.440]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:35.880]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:39.240]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:41.340]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:45.240]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:47.580]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:16:47.580 --> 02:16:49.380]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:51.140]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:16:51.140 --> 02:16:53.980]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:55.940]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:16:58.780]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:16:58.780 --> 02:17:01.460]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:03.380]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:05.260]   And on all those social media platforms,
[02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:07.660]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:09.120]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:10.320]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:12.800]   but much of which is distinct from the content covered
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:14.080]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:17.800]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:19.160]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:21.200]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:22.480]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:24.120]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:25.920]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:27.840]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:29.800]   one to three page PDFs.
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:32.840]   These protocols cover things like deliberate cold exposure,
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:35.200]   deliberate heat exposure, how to optimize your dopamine,
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:36.820]   how to improve your sleep,
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:38.540]   all available at zero cost.
[02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:39.900]   To access these newsletters,

[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:47.380]   And I should mention that we do not share
[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:48.980]   your email with anybody.
[02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:50.540]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:53.300]   for today's discussion with Dr. Shauna Swan.
[02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:55.660]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:57.760]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:00.340]   [upbeat music]
