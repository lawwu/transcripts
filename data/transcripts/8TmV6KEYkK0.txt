[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120]   You know who drank?
[00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.160]   It's Churchill.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.680]   - That's my, hold on, that's my guy.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.520]   - Yeah.
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.340]   - You know that's my guy, right?
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.040]   - So he did champagne.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.960]   - Well, you don't have to tell me a thing
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.840]   about Winston Churchill.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.360]   He, I found out about his daily routine.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.180]   - Yeah.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.600]   - So his daily routine was a big breakfast, cigar,
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.680]   coffee, eggs sunny side up, toast, bacon, sausage,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.680]   tomato, beans, fruit, orange juice, soft scotch,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.000]   cigar in bed, and he'd sit there for three hours.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.400]   And then he'd get in the bathtub and drink champagne.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.800]   And then he'd go to lunch and have some goose
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.400]   with more champagne.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.360]   And then he'd take a nap.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.400]   And like, I love that.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.960]   So every year on the day of his death,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.360]   I think it's January 24th,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.040]   I celebrate Winston Churchill's life
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.600]   by living the way he did.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.240]   And so I have breakfast in bed with a soft scotch
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.440]   and I just party all day.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.240]   That would be the guy to drink with.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.840]   - The following is a conversation with Bird Crusher,
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.640]   a standup comedian, podcaster, actor,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.960]   and a man they call The Machine.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.200]   I've been a fan of his comedy and podcasts for many years.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.360]   And I highly recommend you watch him on BirdCast,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.000]   Two Bears, One Cave with Tom Segura,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   his cooking show called Something Is Burning,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.360]   and finally, the new movie that tells the story of the man,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300]   the legend, The Machine.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.080]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.200]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600]   in the description.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.120]   And now, dear friends, here's Bird Crusher.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.480]   I read somewhere that you like Ernest Hemingway.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.440]   - Love him.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.480]   - There's a quote, "There's nothing to writing.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.880]   "All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed."
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.720]   Do you agree with that?
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.440]   - I agree, I agree.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.680]   Well, I agree with that with journaling.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.680]   'Cause I can't write standup, like I can't write a bit,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.440]   but if I journal, I'll find something that I go just write.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.640]   Kind of writing where the pen's moving faster
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.800]   than your brain and they're kind of like doing it together.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.600]   The thing I liked about Ernest Hemingway,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.160]   this is so stupid, I'm a little dyslexic
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.280]   and so I'm not a good reader.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.640]   And so he wrote very simply.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.320]   And it wasn't until after I read a bunch
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.440]   of Ernest Hemingway, I was working at Barnes & Noble,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.520]   and this person said, "Don't you love his titles?"
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.480]   And I was like, "Yeah, Sun Also Rises."
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.240]   And they're like, "Yeah, but, no, the Sun Also Rises."
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.120]   And I was like, "Yeah, Sun Also Rises."
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.720]   And they're like, "No, the Sun Also Rises."
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.720]   And I went, "Oh, oh yeah, that is fucking badass, yeah."
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.440]   And then I'm always late to the party with anything.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.560]   And then that night we were all doing Coke
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.800]   and it was like five in the morning
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.680]   and we ended up on the roof of my apartment
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.100]   in Greenwich Village.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.980]   And I'm a sunset guy, I grew up in Florida,
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.080]   but sunrises in New York are electric blue,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.860]   like electric blue.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.640]   And I was like, "The Sun Also Rises."
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.680]   (laughing)
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.960]   - Yeah, he was so good with just a handful of words.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.520]   - Yeah. - The simplicity,
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.440]   the choice of words, like basically his process
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.440]   is carving down. - Write drunk, edit sober.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.160]   - Write drunk, edit sober. - Yeah.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.400]   But he was good at like a small amount of words
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   to get a point across, I'm the exact fucking opposite.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.880]   - Well, he's also said, "The first draft of anything
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.000]   "is always shit."
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.640]   Is that true for you? - I think so.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.840]   (laughing)
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.640]   It's the best one I have.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.960]   - It goes downhill from there.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.240]   So for you, editing is destroying the original genius.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.440]   - The first time I tell it, it's perfect.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.880]   It's perfect, it works.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.440]   And then I go, "Great," and then I take it
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.160]   and I try to fix it and make it better and jazzier.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.520]   I just joke and razzle dazzle about my daughters
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.400]   and I drive them past a deaf child sign.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.600]   And I just told it on stage, it just happened.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.200]   And Louis was in the audience.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.040]   He goes, "I love that joke."
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.240]   I said, "Really?"
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.880]   He goes, "Yeah, and I just told it and I went, 'Done.'"
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.520]   Louis CK says he likes the joke, it's fucking,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.680]   it's in the special.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.920]   And I tried to fucking razzle dazzle that joke
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.720]   into like a 15 minute bit.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.040]   It got to the point where it was so bad
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.600]   that I told him, I did a podcast with him,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.880]   I said, "What did you like about that joke?"
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.720]   'Cause I can't get it to work anymore.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.840]   He goes, "It was just simple.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.800]   "It was simple that your daughter didn't know
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.440]   "how they'd figure out where deaf kids lived."
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.880]   I went, "That's it?"
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.720]   He's like, "Yeah, nothing about gun control?"
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720]   And he was like, "Huh?"
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.140]   I was like, "Oh, fuck, man.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.280]   "I really fucked that joke up."
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.120]   And then I had to go back to the beginning of it.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.920]   But that first time, that's when the joke
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.120]   comes out purest for me and then it's always chasing back
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.180]   to get that first telling.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.440]   Some jokes are different, like the machine,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.680]   obviously there's a much longer story
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.480]   and escape room for this one.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.080]   The longer stories take a little work,
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.920]   but the simple ones, like the deaf child in pajamas,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.400]   and those first times are perfect.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.160]   - What do you think is it about the machine story
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.400]   that works that was so captivating for people?
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.360]   - I think it's a, I think, I don't know.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.960]   I really wish, I don't know.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.040]   I think it's a good story.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.880]   I think it's a good story.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.960]   I think everyone has something similar
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.600]   that happened in their life where they had a crazy night
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.280]   and that no one believed and they told their friends
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.480]   and their friends, or they experienced that
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.680]   with a friend like that.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.400]   And I think, I think that's gotta be it.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.520]   I really don't know.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.520]   I think there's a part of, I think there's a part
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.760]   of the, like our community of comedy fans
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.960]   that were that early death squad that was fun
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.440]   to watch someone take something from the podcast
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.840]   and turn it into a bit on stage.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.840]   I think there was a lot of that,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.760]   but I think people identify with a wild, crazy night
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.960]   that got out of control that they've probably had too.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.880]   I think, I don't fucking know.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.520]   - Do you think Putin knows who you are
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.640]   because of that story?
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.960]   - I hope so.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.760]   I fucking hope so.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.800]   I hope so.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.160]   But there's a part of me that you gotta understand
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.000]   is like, I'm not, I say stuff like that,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.400]   I'm sure there's someone hears that and they go,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.040]   who is this fucking narcissist?
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.960]   You're like, no, that's not it.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.560]   I'm just telling you the truth.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.840]   Like I understand what I'm supposed to say.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.000]   Well, you know, I don't know.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.480]   I, you know, I don't know, that's hard to say,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.440]   but I don't fucking give a shit about that guy.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   I'm not that guy.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.520]   I'm telling you everything that comes out of my mouth.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.120]   The second it comes out, I'm gonna be 100% honest,
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.600]   I don't know any other way to live.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.200]   I kind of hope so.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.560]   That would be fucking cool.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.400]   And I look, I know he's a bad, I guess he's a bad dude.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   I don't follow politics, Don, but it'd be cool
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.800]   if like one day someone's like, he's on his computer
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.880]   and some guy goes, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.120]   And he's like, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.320]   And he's like, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.720]   And he's like, and he shows it to him.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.480]   And then he's like, fucking this guy, huh?
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.640]   - It's not out of the realm of possibility
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.360]   that Putin has watched it.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.720]   I mean, this podcast has kind of made me realize
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.400]   how like small the world is.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   I've gotten to meet some incredibly like interesting people.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.180]   - Like that's, I mean, that's the thing where I go,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.160]   it's gotten really crazy.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.600]   The internet's really insane and Netflix is really insane.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.800]   And the reach of like people that like,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.920]   this is really simple, but like,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.640]   I'm a big fan of the show "Drink Champs."
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.840]   I didn't think in a million years
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.120]   Nori would ever know who I was.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.800]   And then he offered me to come to his podcast.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.720]   And then when I got there, he told me he was a fan of mine.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.860]   And I went, like, I remember moving to New York,
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.000]   listening to you and Capone.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.600]   Like I'm sitting there going, wow.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.920]   Like, and then the phone calls I've gotten
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.840]   since the movie came out and since "Razzle Dazzle" came out
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.440]   have been really insane when you realize
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.880]   as much as I know about people,
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.640]   and I like, there's people I'm fans of
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.880]   that don't know who I am.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.720]   That are like, they're like some pitcher in fucking Florida
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.640]   that I follow the kids.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.520]   I like, it's fun to watch them pitch.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.440]   There was a softball player in Tempe
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.960]   that she's do catching drills.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.600]   And I was really into softball with my daughter
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.840]   and we watched her catching drills.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.280]   There's a girl, Dee Glazer, who me and my daughters
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.260]   will watch her dance videos.
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.100]   And then I hit her up.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:11.920]   She's like, you know who I am?
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.080]   And you're like, oh yeah, that's the way the world works.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.400]   - What world leader would you drink with if you could?
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.560]   So you mentioned Putin.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.600]   So Putin doesn't drink much.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.440]   - Yeah.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.240]   - Zelensky drinks more, but also not much.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.000]   - Boris Yeltsin would have been a good one.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.800]   He would have been a fucking good one.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.160]   I mean, like I go, Hitler was a pussy.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.800]   Like he drank wine with a spoonful of sugar in it.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.720]   - You know who he drank?
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.560]   - What?
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.400]   - Churchill.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.440]   - That's my, hold on, that's my guy.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.260]   - Yeah.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.100]   - You know that's my guy, right?
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.240]   - No, I don't know that's your guy.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.080]   So he did champagne.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.040]   - Well, do you want to tell me a thing
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.920]   about Winston Churchill?
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.400]   He, I found out about his daily routine.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.240]   - Yeah.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.320]   - So his daily routine was a big breakfast, cigar, coffee,
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.320]   eggs sunny side up, toast, bacon, sausage, tomato, beans,
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.120]   fruit, orange juice, soft scotch, cigar in bed.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.760]   And he'd sit there for three hours
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.360]   and he'd hold morning breakfast.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.840]   And that's, they'd come in and he'd run through his day.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.240]   And then he'd get in the bathtub for fucking an hour
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.480]   and drink champagne.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.780]   And then he'd go to lunch and have some goose
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.280]   or whatever the fuck they ate back then
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.920]   with more champagne.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.320]   And then, and then, I mean, and then he'd take a nap.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.380]   And like, I love that.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.960]   So every year on the day of his death,
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.320]   I think it's January 24th,
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.040]   I celebrate Winston Churchill's life
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.600]   by living the way he did.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.240]   And so I have breakfast in bed with a soft scotch
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.840]   and I just party all fucking day.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.860]   That would be the guy to drink with.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.380]   That would be the guy,
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.120]   if you could pick anyone to drink with.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.360]   - He drank every day throughout the day.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.040]   - And lived like 94.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.960]   - And was one of the most heroic figures in human history.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.500]   Never, never surrender.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.320]   I mean.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.480]   - What a fucking badass thing.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.720]   You know, he taught, he taught the queen.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.000]   The queen was like a window licking idiot, right?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.920]   Like she was, she had a third grade education.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.480]   So like her dad dies and she's like 10 or 12 or whatever.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.960]   The first thing they do is they pull her out of school.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.800]   They're like, you're done learning.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.080]   You're just gonna be the queen.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.880]   You gotta know, this is what you need to learn.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.300]   Don't make, let people make eye contact with you.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.520]   Put your hand out like this.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.700]   Don't let people touch you.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.920]   So she like, she had like a really, I saw the,
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.080]   by the way, I didn't do this research.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.000]   I just watched the crown, okay?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.760]   And Winston Churchill kind of taught her
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.880]   about world politics and was like,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.360]   they like come in and she'd be like,
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.760]   Winston, what did we do in Africa?
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.120]   And he's like, this is gonna be a tough one.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.220]   And so, yeah, so, but Winston Churchill's the badass.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.640]   But if I had to drink with someone living, like drink,
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.120]   and there's like, there's a two obvious ones.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.920]   Like, obviously it's fucking Kim Jong-un, right?
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.760]   You kind of want to.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.600]   - He drinks.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.760]   - No, he does.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.840]   (laughing)
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.840]   You think my IVs are good in the morning?
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.520]   You know, Kim Jong-un's IVs are next.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.440]   You're like, I feel up.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.400]   And he's like, it's amphetamine.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.240]   He would be a badass to drink with.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.720]   - I think he drinks hard liquor.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.280]   - I think it's scotch, Johnny Walker blue.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.040]   That's what I've heard.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.400]   - I don't know where you heard this, but I like this.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.000]   - Okay, so I say things like that, but then I'm sure,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.720]   I don't know if you've ever partied with someone
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.040]   who just parties a little different than you,
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.360]   and then you notice like, sometimes celebrities,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.280]   like athletes, and then like you're at a strip club,
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.440]   and then they talk weird to a woman.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.240]   You're like, oh, that's not me, I'm so sorry.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.080]   So that'd be the thing,
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.880]   the atrocities would be hard to get past with them.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.840]   - Not just the atrocity, but the way of being.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.680]   I agree with you.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.560]   I actually don't like drinking with rich
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.440]   and powerful people often.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.120]   There's something weird about them.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.120]   - Yeah. - Not all of them.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.960]   - And I don't like a drinking meeting.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.440]   Like when someone goes-- (laughing)
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.720]   - What's a drinking meeting?
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.800]   - Like when people go like,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.600]   hey, I'm taking you out tonight, we're drinking.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.440]   - Yeah. - And then I go,
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.880]   oh, that's not the way I like to do it.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.980]   It gives me anxiety.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.480]   Our lives are very different.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.880]   - You and I? - Yeah.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.200]   We're in a fraternity?
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.920]   - No. (laughing)
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.760]   We could start there, no, it was not.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.840]   - Okay. (laughing)
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.800]   - And the differences continue from there, I'm sure.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.160]   - So when you get your pledge of pen,
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.080]   they take you out and their whole thing is,
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.640]   we're getting you fucked up.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.120]   That energy is not my energy.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.440]   I don't like that.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.840]   I just go, why don't we just get drunk
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.720]   and feel really good about ourselves?
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.280]   Like I never took mushrooms to see Jesus.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.400]   I just wanted to enjoy Rain X on a windshield.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.160]   So that for me is one of my things.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.840]   So if Kim Jong-un flew me to North Korea to drink with him,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.680]   I'd be like, I'd have to start really getting blackout drunk
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.280]   on the plane to enjoy drinking with him that day.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.400]   - What's your favorite, like different occasions,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.440]   what's your favorite drink?
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.520]   What's your favorite way of drinking?
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.800]   - I've got, it varies.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.080]   - So what are the different contexts here?
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.520]   Like one-on-one.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.440]   - One-on-one?
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.000]   - Like you sit down with, I don't know,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Rogan invites you like it's a godfather to sit down
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.600]   and finally have a talk about something.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.120]   - It's gonna be whiskey.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.360]   It's gonna be like a nice whiskey.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.200]   - Neat?
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.400]   - No, I like it on the rocks.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.960]   I like lots of rocks.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.000]   It won't be something expensive 'cause Rogan is not,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.720]   he's not a fancy boy, you know?
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.320]   Like he's a real regular, he's a really regular dude.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.640]   He's gotten less regular the more millions of dollars
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.480]   he has.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.320]   (laughing)
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.920]   There's parts of him where you're like,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.640]   like where you're like, oh wow, we can do this?
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.080]   - Yeah.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.280]   - But he's a regular, he'd be like Jack on the Rocks
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.040]   or like probably Buffalo Trace or one of the,
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.560]   maybe a little whiskey he's buying.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.520]   Rogan would be whiskey, rocks, and then like,
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.320]   that's a good, I haven't hung out with Joe by ourselves.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.800]   I take that back, I was with him the other night.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.000]   But like, it would be cool, my times with Joe's
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.120]   are always on podcasts.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.960]   - Yeah.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.320]   - And his, I miss the times where it was,
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.480]   where you just have you and him at the store late night.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.680]   - Yeah, I'm okay with podcasts.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.400]   Like I used to think this is like performative
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.920]   or something like this, but it's not really.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.760]   - No.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.920]   - It's just a chance to really sit down.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.120]   - I enjoy it because of the people
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.800]   I could never sit down with.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.640]   - Ah.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.440]   - Like David Cross, I would never sit down with David Cross
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.520]   'cause we don't run in the same circles,
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.320]   but it's nice, he has something to promote,
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.240]   and then he comes to my house and then we can sit down
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.240]   for an hour and talk, and then, or Kevin Smith.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.640]   Like people I would never really hang out with.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.640]   Tom, I enjoy being alone with Tom more.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.440]   - Off mic, Tom Segura.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.160]   - Yeah, we have a lot of history.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.840]   There's a lot of things, secrets we know about each other,
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.680]   and there's a lot of secrets going on in each other's lives
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.520]   that I would never share on podcasts
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.120]   that I can talk to him about.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.160]   And I really appreciate his, and I know this isn't
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.080]   on brand of us beating each other up,
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.920]   but like I really appreciate his insight as a dad
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.280]   and as a dude and as a son,
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.640]   but he makes me giggle harder than anyone,
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.120]   so doing a podcast is fun.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.200]   - So there's something on a podcast that's performative
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.760]   for you with him, and then there's a part--
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.320]   - With me and him, 'cause we're trying
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.640]   to make each other laugh.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.240]   But I'll tell you, if we're going back to drinks,
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.240]   I'll tell you, like a great afternoon drink
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.000]   is a Campari Spritz, it's one of my favorite drinks
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.840]   in the world.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.960]   - I don't even know what that is, Campari Spritz.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.680]   - Campari is an interesting alcohol
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.400]   because I think it's a bitter, or it's a liqueur,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.160]   and it's got a weird, rooty, earthy taste.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.640]   It's red, so it looks like Kool-Aid,
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.080]   that's why I got into it.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.320]   I thought Campari on Ice would be oh so nice,
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.000]   it was an old commercial, but man,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   it's fucking like sucking the green giant's dick.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.640]   It is earthy.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.480]   - What's earthy?
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.080]   - It's like, it tastes like roots.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.160]   It's just-- - Oh, nice.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.240]   - It's not, it's not, there's a bitterness,
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.880]   and like a, it's just not great.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.000]   And then someone introduced me to a Negroni,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.440]   which is Campari and gin, and a little soda water,
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.600]   and then Campari Spritz.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.480]   Campari Spritz is Campari, Prosecco, and soda water,
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.480]   in like a wine glass, and it is so enjoyable.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.400]   It's got so many different profiles to it,
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.880]   where you get the bitterness,
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.400]   but the sweetness of the Prosecco,
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.120]   and then it flattens it out with the soda water,
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.920]   and it looks like Kool-Aid, so I love it.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.040]   That's one of my favorite drinks.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.640]   - To share in what context?
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.280]   Oh, you're in Italy, and you've been walking around Venice,
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.000]   and everyone went their own ways,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.240]   and the whole family comes back together,
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.840]   and you meet at a statue, and your wife's sweating,
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.160]   and she's uncomfortable, and your daughters are 16 and 18,
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.520]   and they're like, "Oh, what are we doing
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.800]   "with the rest of the day?"
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.200]   And you go, "Hey guys, it's Europe.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.880]   "Does anyone want a Campari Spritz?"
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.120]   And everyone goes, "I don't know what that is."
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.320]   And you go, "Four Campari Spritz."
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.640]   It's a minor in alcohol, so it's not gonna light them up,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.120]   but it gives them a little bit of a buzz,
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.160]   where they're like, "Dad, these are nice.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.160]   "Isla didn't drink hers, so I drank hers.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   "Georgia had hers, Leanne had hers,
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.320]   "and we ordered another round.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.320]   "I ordered an," and they're fucking refreshing,
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.880]   and the buzz is perfect.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.920]   It's not too much, 'cause it's just a little bit
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.880]   of champagne and some Campari.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.320]   The buzz is perfect, and then a couple of them,
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.840]   and then they kinda disappear,
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.840]   and then you're just walking around again.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.440]   That's a great fucking drink.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.640]   - You ever drink alone?
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.160]   (laughing)
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.760]   - So there's two kinds of alone.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.640]   One is alone at a bar.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.880]   There's other people, but they're strangers, right?
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.280]   They're kinda like out there.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.560]   - Okay, I've done that.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.400]   Keep going.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.600]   Keep going, don't walk me through all the alones,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.440]   and then I'll tell you the rest.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.760]   - There's all kinds of, there's alone on a train,
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.600]   like transporting someone.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.440]   - I've drank alone on a train, yeah.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.600]   - A train, plane, and then there's just alone
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.280]   in an empty home.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.120]   - Or a hotel room.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.960]   - Hotel, or hotel room.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.000]   - And it's Sunday night.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.840]   - Sunday night.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.520]   - And you're packing your bag,
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.040]   and you got a flight at 6 a.m.,
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.500]   but Roadhouse is on, and you're like, shit.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.480]   So you get out of the front desk and go,
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.600]   "Is the bar still open?"
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.360]   And they go, "Yeah, can I order some to take to my room?"
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.100]   "Sure, how about six Heinekens?"
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.080]   "Six Heinekens?"
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.520]   "Yeah, my wife wanted one too."
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.440]   "She's not up there."
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.600]   You murdered her.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.520]   And you just say to yourself, "I'm just getting six,
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.760]   "so that if I have four, I just know I have two extra ones."
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.360]   And then you go through six, and you're like,
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.000]   "Oh man, I'm not done yet."
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.280]   Dude, I've drank in every alone scenario
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.000]   you can possibly think of.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.880]   I've drank alone in a helicopter with a dude
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.040]   who didn't know I was drinking.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.880]   He was like, "Can I drink in here?"
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.200]   And he was like, "Absolutely not."
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.680]   And then I poured it into a flask,
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.040]   and I opened it and drank it, and he's like,
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.800]   "Dude, we're in a fucking helicopter.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.480]   "You don't think I'd smell that?"
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.920]   The best alone drinking you can ever do, in my opinion,
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.560]   now we're getting into the weeds on it,
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.560]   is alone behind someone's back.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.480]   - What do you mean?
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.160]   - Like when they don't know you're drinking,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.160]   but you're drinking.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.920]   Like Christmas shopping.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.400]   And your wife says, "All right, let's all split up."
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.480]   And you go, "Cool."
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.080]   And it's like 11 o'clock on a Sunday,
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.000]   and they just opened that bar by the elevator
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.320]   in the Beverly Center, and you just sneak over,
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.600]   and you go, "Hey man, can I get a double Jack
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.480]   "on the Ross Oxford Rots?"
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.320]   And they're like, "Sure."
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.200]   And you just have it, and you just go, "Let's just..."
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.640]   And then you're off, and then you're like, "Yeah."
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.160]   And then you just, little sneak one, sneak it, sneak it.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.520]   And then you're-- - And you're buzzed
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.360]   and nobody knows.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.560]   - And then your wife's like, "Wait, have you been drinking?"
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.960]   You're like, "Do I?"
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.760]   Yeah, I'm drinking by myself in a fucking mall on Christmas.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.200]   How sad do you think I am?
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.360]   And then you go, "Yeah, I am."
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.920]   - What about mood?
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.240]   Do you ever drink in a dark place?
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.280]   - So I broke, I had a chick break up,
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.080]   or a chick cheat on me when I came back from Russia,
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.200]   and she slept with my best friend,
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.120]   and I didn't know how to deal with the emotions I had,
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.960]   and my buddy, Mike Osborne, said, "I can tell you this.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.200]   "If you drink, they go away."
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.680]   And I went, "Okay."
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.520]   And that was the first and kind of last time
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.880]   I ever did that, because I did it, I've done it,
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.720]   I've done it a couple times, but I try to avoid,
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.280]   I try to avoid if there's emotion going to alcohol.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.400]   Like, meaning, not when it's anxiety, but like depression.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.240]   I kind of sit in the depression, or anxiety.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.040]   I lean towards alcohol, like anxiety, like about flying,
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.420]   or just like getting worked up over something.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.760]   But with depression, I try to avoid alcohol
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   and just sit in it, because I've gone there before.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.400]   But anxiety, I land all the time.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.280]   - But depression, heartbreak, all that,
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.260]   you just sit in the feeling.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.400]   - Yeah.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.480]   Heartbreak's a weird one for me.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.240]   So like the last time I got my heart broken,
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.760]   Leanne dumped me.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.120]   We were dating for like four months,
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.640]   and she broke up with me.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.280]   And my instinct was to have a drink.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.120]   My friends went to this Middle Eastern restaurant,
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.280]   and I told them what was going on,
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.680]   and my buddy Cory was like, "Let's get a cocktail."
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.320]   And I was like, "I don't want one.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.300]   "I gotta figure this out, 'cause I want this chick.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.340]   "And if I start drinking, I'll be like, 'Ah, fuck it.'"
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.500]   So I gotta figure it out.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.980]   Like I wonder, I'm gonna find out my dad dies one day,
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.920]   or my mom, but my dad will be the rough one.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.880]   My mom will be equally as rough.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.040]   My dad and I were really close.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.520]   And I wonder if, I've thought about this a lot,
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.320]   if I'll have a drink dealing with that.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.160]   Like I think about that a lot.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.360]   I keep saying everything I get with my dad is extra.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.520]   My dad had a 100% blockage in his Widowmaker twice.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.200]   And both times they saved his life.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.560]   And he got a stint, I think 12 or 13 years ago,
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.840]   and then he just got a stint this last year.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.800]   But so everything I get to do, I feel like is extra.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.360]   And so he was just at the premiere of my movie,
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.200]   and he got to see that,
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.440]   and he had a very emotional response.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.240]   And I got that from him.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.600]   And I was like, "That's a little icing on the cake."
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.960]   I did, the arena in Tampa was the first time
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.040]   he ever saw me do standup.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.960]   That was like a little extra.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.920]   So all these things I'm getting with him are all extra.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.880]   So I have, I think 74.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.760]   So yeah, that'll be a tough one.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.960]   - Well, at the premiere, he was what, proud?
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.600]   - Yeah, he came out, he was sobbing, crying.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.400]   And he goes, "I've underestimated you your whole life."
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.240]   And I was like, "What?"
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.280]   And he was shaking.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.520]   He goes, "I just underestimated you.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.760]   "I didn't know you were this, whatever."
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.520]   It was really hard to understand him, to be honest with you.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.960]   I don't know totally what he said.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.400]   He might've just not liked the movie.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.060]   (both laughing)
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.120]   - I think you were hearing what you wanted to hear.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.860]   What'd you learn about life from your father?
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.640]   - It's not gonna make sense.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.640]   I wanna feel like sometimes
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.760]   I'm like a professional fucking wrestler.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.080]   'Cause all I care about is you come and see me do standup.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.480]   So whatever I gotta do to get you there.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.680]   But the number one thing,
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.000]   my one takeaway from that man's humility.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.300]   And I've applied it in different ways throughout my career.
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:45.280]   On my 26th birthday, he gave me a really aggressive speech.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:50.320]   I was hungover and I just thought he was gonna say,
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.360]   "Happy birthday."
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.880]   So I picked up the phone and I was like, "Hey."
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.600]   And he was like, "You are a tremendous piece of shit."
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.720]   And he broke me off.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.140]   You have no humility, you have no this,
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.520]   you've never succeeded at anything.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.320]   You're lying to yourself,
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.520]   you're lying to everyone around you.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.600]   You're not doing what you're going after your dream.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   I broke you, I failed you as a father, this and that.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.520]   I was like, "I thought you were gonna wish me
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   "happy birthday."
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:16.520]   And so in that speech, he told me if I wanted something,
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.880]   I had to go at it and I had to go after it
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.840]   as hard as I could.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.600]   And I had to do whatever I could do to achieve that.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.740]   In this case, it was offering to do anything
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.540]   at the comedy club to get on stage.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.480]   I told him, "That's not how it works."
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.960]   And he said, "No, that's how it works
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.520]   "for some poor kid from Harlem
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.240]   "because that kid needs it."
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.740]   He goes, "You've grown up with privilege your whole life,
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.680]   "you don't need it.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.720]   "You think you're gonna be fine."
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.460]   And so I went and I ended up getting a job at the door,
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.480]   but it's humbling.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.560]   It made me feel uncomfortable.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.440]   And so that humility, it's the first time
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.480]   I really understood humility and I've applied that
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.000]   in many respects in getting to be a paid regular
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.320]   at the comedy store that happened late in life for me.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.960]   And which I think most people would give up
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.040]   and be like, "Fuck that, I'm already a touring comic,
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.760]   "I'm on TV, I don't need that."
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.160]   But it's something I wanted and I knew I wanted,
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.440]   so I just humbly went after it.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.320]   And then I think I still apply it
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.400]   when it comes to selling tickets
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.560]   or selling a project to the fans.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.200]   Or even to doing podcasts, I try to be as honest as I can
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.440]   about whatever I'm going through,
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.460]   whatever I'm dealing with.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.240]   But when it comes to selling things,
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.940]   I don't have a problem trying to make fun of myself
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.920]   or get in front of people so that they know
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.100]   that I have a show 'cause the thing I'm good at,
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.700]   the one thing I know I'm good at is stand up.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.240]   And I say that humbly, but I want them to come there.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.880]   So I've heard people make fun of me before,
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.720]   they're like, "Yeah, I'm not some clown in a Speedo
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.640]   "who's gonna, I'm a real comic."
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.800]   And I go, "Okay, but I want them at my shows
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.720]   "and you can be that guy and I'll be this guy."
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.800]   - Yeah, the clown in the Speedo.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.000]   - Yeah, it's like, "What are you gonna do?"
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.160]   Funny people make fun of me for taking my shirt off,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.840]   like I guess behind my back, no one ever does it to me.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.000]   Like no one would ever.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.140]   Comics aren't that manly.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:23.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.340]   - But I always go like, "What do you care?
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.240]   "What do you care?"
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.180]   - And you love taking your shirt off?
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.960]   - More than anything.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.660]   - You know, when something becomes meme
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:39.020]   and becomes super popular, it becomes easy
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.780]   to not love the thing anymore, to get tired of it.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.620]   You still love it?
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.540]   - Well, more than anything.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:49.100]   I like being shirtless more than having a shirt.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.060]   I'm very uncomfortable in a shirt.
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.140]   Like right now, and I have tactile issues,
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.440]   like I have legit tactile issues.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.740]   I'm most comfortable in stretchy jeans
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.140]   with a loose-fitting belt and then these shirts exactly,
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.640]   but I like more like a V-neck.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.260]   I can feel this on my neck right now
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.900]   and I can feel it on my arms.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.900]   And so I'll sit a certain way 'cause it just rubs me wrong
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.020]   but yeah, I'm more comfortable shirtless.
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.780]   I can never wear what you're wearing.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.580]   - Yeah, well, this is my shirtless.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.180]   Each of us have to find our place in this world
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.020]   in terms of fashion.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.180]   - I would love to be able to wear what you wear
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.020]   'cause it looks good.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.120]   - It feels like an escape from convention.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.380]   - What, you or me?
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.220]   - Both of us.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.060]   - Yeah.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.500]   - 'Cause nobody wears this
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.980]   unless you work security for somebody.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.460]   - Yeah, but it looks good on you.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.300]   - Does it?
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.140]   I don't know.
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.120]   - I think people think,
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.780]   I don't know, they would say like,
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.700]   "What if you lose weight?
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.980]   "You can't take your shirt off anymore?"
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.180]   I go, "No, I can't fucking take my shirt off.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.020]   "You're fucking out of your mind.
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.300]   "I'm gonna take my shirt off all the time."
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.300]   - You mentioned early on heartbreak after the Russia trip
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.300]   with a girl who slept with your friend.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.220]   Let's go back to Hemingway quotes.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.660]   The best way to find out if you can trust somebody
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.180]   is to trust them.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.860]   So to go all in with the trust.
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.840]   I love Hemingway so much.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.340]   Have you been betrayed in your life?
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.620]   - Yeah.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.220]   - What do you think about trust?
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.420]   - That's an interesting question.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:32.320]   I've been betrayed in my professional life a couple of times
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.780]   by really close friends.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:39.780]   And I'm not someone who can't,
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:44.020]   I have a mantra that, I don't know if people
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.540]   have heard it or not, and I hate sharing it,
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.500]   but it's true.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.580]   The mantra is, "So you think I'm weak."
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.820]   That's my thing, 'cause I feel like people
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:58.220]   take advantage of me, and I go, "So you think I'm weak."
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.980]   You forget, everyone that,
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.260]   like when I name the people that have betrayed me,
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.220]   I'm a larger man than all of them.
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.460]   And so that's what really fucks with me,
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.740]   is I go, "So you think I'm weak?"
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.180]   Like where I grew up, when you do stuff,
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.620]   there was physical consequences.
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.740]   I grew up in Florida, I've been beaten up a bunch.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.020]   I'm not saying I can fight, but I'm not scared
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.740]   of getting beaten up.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.740]   And the times that I've been betrayed,
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.740]   and I know even by Ari, which people see that
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.020]   drugging as a betrayal, and I did for a period,
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.220]   but it was only because it was Ari,
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.900]   and he was one of my best friends.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.580]   And me and him had to work through that,
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.980]   'cause I couldn't not love him.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.340]   Like I couldn't not have him in my life.
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.540]   He means a lot to me, he really does.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.420]   He's a great friend to have, but he's also,
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.220]   I don't know what was going on with him at that time,
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.860]   but he made a bad decision, and I had to forgive him
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.060]   for that, because I knew he knew my mantra.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.740]   I think I'm harder to trust people now.
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.840]   I'm not as apt to trust people at all.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.980]   But there was a moment, I don't know if I've ever
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.260]   shared this, and I don't know how this will sound,
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.140]   but there was a moment that information got leaked
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.300]   out of thing, and all my managers and agents,
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:15.300]   both Tom and our managers and agents would like
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:20.300]   to either separate us, or one of them get both of us.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.060]   It's just more lucrative for them.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.300]   So they have always kind of pitted us against each other,
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.240]   a little bit, and they do it subtly.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.940]   They'll do it to me, and my team, and then his team
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.820]   will do it to me, and then my team will do it to him,
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.820]   and his team will do it to him.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.460]   And there was a moment where information got leaked
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.980]   about this thing I was doing, and my team was like,
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.540]   just so you know, your boy Tommy is the rat.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:51.140]   And I had to, it was the one time, and Leanne said,
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.220]   "Do you think Tom would do that?"
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.720]   I said, "I don't know how faith works.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.180]   "I'm not a super religious person, but I will tell you
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.960]   "that I believe in Tom, and I don't think he did it,
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.940]   "and I will stand by that ignorantly,
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.940]   "and I will ride or die with him,
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.140]   "because I cannot live in a world where I don't trust him.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:16.340]   "If I don't trust him, then I am so fucked."
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.260]   And it wasn't him.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.260]   It wasn't him, and it's a cool feeling to know
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.460]   that you could blindly trust someone,
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.820]   blindly have faith in someone, know that they have
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.940]   your best interest at heart.
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.180]   But yeah, it took me a while to get there.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.620]   Rogan helped me get there, 'cause I wasn't trusting him,
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.940]   or Joey, or Tommy, or anyone.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.820]   I wasn't trusting anyone.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.600]   I'd gotten in a bad thing,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.820]   and I just wasn't trusting anybody.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.300]   And Rogan was like, "Yo, man, we're trying
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.540]   "to be your fucking friend."
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.880]   And I was like, "Yeah, I don't need friends."
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.460]   I couldn't understand why Rogan was interested in me,
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.260]   and I said to someone, I was like, "Is he gay?
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.700]   "What the fuck?"
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.460]   And then he was just a nice guy.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.160]   He was just a nice guy.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.740]   (laughing)
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.220]   - That'd be hilarious if Joe was sexually attracted to you
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.220]   this whole time.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.740]   This whole time is the reason he keeps inviting you back.
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.540]   - I would be more excited, I would be more excited
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.940]   if just if he tried to kiss me on the lips once.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.140]   Just in a Scotty J way from "Boogie Nights,"
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.780]   where he's like, "What, do you like my car?"
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.260]   - Yeah, you know nobody would believe that story.
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.340]   - No one.
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.340]   If I was Joe, I would kiss dudes all the time,
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.300]   and then when they didn't kiss back,
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.300]   oh, you know no one will ever believe you.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.460]   - Yeah, when you trust people like that,
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.140]   and they fuck you over, that can really, really, really hurt.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.820]   - You end up on a treadmill in a hotel room
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.660]   fighting with them.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.980]   You fight with them all the time.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.380]   You fight with them all the time.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.420]   You fight with them constantly.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.620]   And I have this thing where I ruminate on an idea,
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.980]   and I can't get it out of my head,
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.180]   and I hear the words they say, and I--
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.780]   - So all in your head, on a treadmill, in your head,
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.620]   just fighting.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.780]   - Just fucking fighting, and then, yeah.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.220]   And then one day you get past it.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.300]   Like one day you just go, "Eh, fuck 'em.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.900]   "I'm not gonna let him give 'em real estate."
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.420]   And then you just forget about 'em,
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.460]   and then they reach out,
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.260]   and they'll try to be a dick or a bully,
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.100]   'cause they're bullies.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.100]   They're bullies is what they are.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.020]   Don't ever forget it.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:14.900]   They're fucking bullies.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.980]   And they got bullied.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.880]   It's not their fault they got bullied.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.140]   And then they try to bully you,
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.940]   and you don't have any connection anymore,
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.500]   and you're like, "Oh, you can go fuck yourself.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.820]   "You can actually go fuck yourself.
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.020]   "You're not my boss.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:26.860]   "You're not my wife.
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.020]   "You don't fuck me, you don't pay me.
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.220]   "Get the fuck out of my life."
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.220]   - But this kind of mantra of the, "You're not weak,"
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.460]   you still wanna be able to be fragile to the world
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.220]   and appear weak almost.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.060]   - Well, I am, I am.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:38.900]   I mean, that's the problem,
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.700]   is I think I am pretty fucking weak.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.740]   Like, I'm not the strongest dude out there.
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.820]   I have really thin skin.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.940]   My feelings hurt all the time.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.780]   - Yeah.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:52.780]   - And so, but it sucks when you watch your friend
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.820]   see something in you that you go,
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.060]   where they go, "Ah, fuck him.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.800]   "He's not paying attention.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.640]   "Fuck him.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.460]   "Let's just fuck him.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.460]   "Let's take his money.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.860]   "You know what, fuck him.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.180]   "He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.340]   "Look at him, he's a drunk alcoholic."
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.100]   And you go, "Oh, no, bitch, I pay attention.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.420]   "Like, I'm wide awake.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.760]   "I'm here, I'm working my ass off.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.060]   "You're not gonna fucking."
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.540]   - Well, that's the tough thing about, like,
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.460]   you and Tom Segura.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.020]   You're at the top of your game and on top of the world,
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.860]   some of the most famous comics in the world,
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.900]   and you could see money start to creep in,
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.860]   like business decisions.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.700]   - Yeah.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.660]   - I don't know, it's a tough place.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.500]   - It's really tough.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.860]   It's really tough, you know, especially as we're growing.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:39.860]   And I'll tell you what,
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.660]   I don't know how much I'm allowed to say,
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.860]   but I can tell you this.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.460]   We had a business deal
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.260]   where feelings were getting involved
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.580]   and money was involved in that,
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.540]   and the money was causing the feelings.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:34:00.380]   And one of us said to the other person,
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.960]   "Our feelings are more important than the money,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.620]   "so let's just split the money."
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:10.420]   And it was really like a solid moment
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.280]   where both of us were like,
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.860]   "That is how we should run this."
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.020]   - Yeah.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.540]   That's the interesting things, like with bands,
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.620]   you have like popular bands that split and even.
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.460]   - Yeah.
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.860]   - Even though it's clear that the contribution is not even.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.420]   It's like, there's a front man and all that kind of stuff,
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.260]   but it's ultimately the right thing to do,
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.380]   to say, "Fuck you," to the money, for the most part,
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.860]   and prioritize the feelings.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.500]   - Yeah, especially because like,
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.380]   I couldn't do it without him, he couldn't do it without me.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.540]   We do it separately, we'll have guest bears on.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.500]   Some will blow up, some won't.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.380]   You can never figure it out,
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.460]   but when we're together, it does well.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.580]   And so we need each other for it to work.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.660]   And we've, like I said,
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.020]   we're on a handshake deal with two bears,
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.340]   and no one likes that.
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.460]   But we're like, "Hey."
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.140]   To the point where he'll call me and go,
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.580]   "Yo, we have a deal to do this for X amount, are you in?"
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.180]   And I go, "Yeah."
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.500]   I don't check the books, I don't need to.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.820]   I know him, I just know him.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:12.820]   - Yeah.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.020]   What do you love most about Tom Segura?
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.020]   - We saw a gay couple one time.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.580]   - Mm-hmm, it was a good start.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.500]   - And there was one guy who was in khakis,
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.260]   and one guy was in jean shorts
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.660]   with a python around his neck.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.780]   - Yeah.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.940]   - And Tom goes, "If we were gay, which one would you be?"
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.500]   I said, "I'm fucking python."
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.900]   And he was like, "Yeah, I'm khaki."
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.740]   And I go, "Really?"
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.060]   And he goes, "Yeah, that's why we work."
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.220]   And he goes, "All relationships are for pythons and khakis."
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.060]   And I went, "Really?"
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:39.900]   And he goes, "Look at you and Leanne.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.740]   "Who do you think you are?"
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.180]   I go, "I'm python."
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.740]   And he goes, "She's khaki."
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.060]   And he goes, "Me and Push?"
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:45.900]   I go, "Oh, she's python."
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.140]   And he goes, "And I'm khaki."
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.660]   He goes, "I'll always be khaki."
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.460]   And sometimes I'll have a relationship around the python,
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.140]   but I'm usually a khaki.
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:53.980]   - Yeah.
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.780]   - And I was like, "Yeah, I am a little bit of a lunatic."
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:01.780]   I'll tell you, a moment that explains
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.220]   me and him, the world will never see,
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.140]   it was just a great moment.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.300]   We got stem cells with Rogan one weekend.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.140]   - Yep.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.540]   - And one day, and I'd had surgery in my arm,
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.500]   and I didn't wanna do it.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.340]   I was terrified.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.620]   And Tom just said, "Just come out and meet up with us.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.780]   'Cause Tom knew he was gonna make me get them."
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:20.580]   And so I got them, and he, you know,
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.380]   Joe's there, and so we're just all talking.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.460]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.380]   And Tom can see that I'm spinning out a little bit.
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.860]   And I get in the car, and Tom's got a Porsche,
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.940]   so we're like right next to each other.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.820]   And I just wanna feel if it's swollen.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.940]   And it is a little swollen, 'cause I just got an injection.
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.660]   And then, and Tom's driving,
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.980]   and he's got his hand on the thing.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.260]   He just puts his hand on my arm, and he goes, "You're okay."
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.180]   He's just, he's watching, he knows me so well
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:50.060]   that he knows that I'm spinning out of control.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.700]   He's like, "You're okay."
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.420]   And then I was like, and I felt okay.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.620]   I was like, "You're right, I'm okay.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.620]   What the fuck am I doing?
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.780]   My brain's that brain."
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.980]   - Man, that guy got so much love in him.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.820]   - Dude, he does.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:06.820]   He has, you know, he had a fantastic relationship
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.580]   with his dad, and I think whatever that dude did
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:17.060]   to create that dude, he hit it out of the fucking park.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.820]   'Cause he has so much love
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:25.340]   that he doesn't need reciprocated at all.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.660]   Like he can just love, and then it feels good
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.780]   for him to give and to take care of someone.
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.340]   And he started the whole birthday gift thing,
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.460]   and he didn't need to.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.140]   He just was like, "Hey man, I had this bike.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.740]   I thought you'd like it."
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.780]   And then of course I've turned it into a fucking bit.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:43.780]   And now we're upside down, I'm 120 upside down
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.180]   on a fucking race car that we can't make our money back on.
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.260]   - I love it.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.740]   What do you love most about Joe Rogan?
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.100]   - Oh, that dude.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.340]   I could go on and on about Joe Rogan.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.140]   Joe Rogan is the most selfless individual I've ever met.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.700]   He doesn't care if he has you on the podcast.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.980]   He wants you to be the funniest person in the room.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.740]   He wants you to be the smartest person in the room.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.780]   Let me tell you something, Joe Rogan is 10 times smarter
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.020]   and funnier than me.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.820]   He wants you to shine.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.940]   He wants to put you over to his fans.
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.340]   That shit did not exist before he started doing his podcast.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.220]   People didn't share you with their fans.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.260]   No one was like, "Hey man, come on on the road with me."
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.540]   They brought you on the road 'cause they wanted you to suck.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.780]   And they put you in bad scenarios.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.260]   Joe Rogan wanted you to shine.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.660]   He gave so many people beautiful careers,
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.380]   gave them careers, gave them.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.700]   Joe could have looked at his podcast as his thing.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.060]   This is my thing.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.380]   I bring on these guys,
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.900]   I'm gonna be the funniest guy in the fucking room.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.860]   I know some guys that have done that.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.340]   It might be me.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.620]   Might be time I talk over people
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.940]   and not listen really well.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.140]   Joe did the opposite.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.380]   Now look, I've tried to learn from Joe on my podcast
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.500]   and do the same.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.180]   That guy, when you think about it,
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.460]   you name 10 of his friends,
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.580]   I bet eight of them are doing arenas right now.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:03.500]   They're all doing theaters.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.740]   All his friends do theaters.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:09.740]   He is just, and he won't accept this compliment.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:18.260]   I tried paying it to him in Austin,
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.420]   when I was in Austin last night.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.180]   - He's not good at accepting compliments.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.100]   - I gave him a gift too.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.540]   And I said, "Hey, I need to show you.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.580]   "I can't just tell you this
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.660]   "'cause it's gonna fall on deaf ears.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.100]   "I need to give you a minute so you have something
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.940]   "so you know that I think about you
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.380]   "and I'm grateful for having you in my life a lot.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.180]   "For many reasons, I have more friends in my life
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.260]   "because of you."
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.140]   He taught me how to trust people again.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.900]   I have a career because of you.
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.380]   I have a major motion picture because of you.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.500]   I do arenas because of you.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.900]   Without you in my life,
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.260]   a lot of these things maybe never would have happened.
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.900]   I never would have told the machine on stage.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.020]   I wouldn't have gotten,
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.500]   I would have never started a podcast.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.180]   I wouldn't have three podcasts.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:00.180]   Like, I mean, all these things are things he not just,
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.580]   he didn't just take me to the water one time
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.420]   and give me a drink.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.980]   He gave me a machete and he said,
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.260]   "This is how I get to the water.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.820]   "You gotta put your own path,
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.380]   "but just give me a heads up.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.740]   "You can also use my path whenever you want."
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.820]   I mean, he is the most selfless individual.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.900]   He will go down in history
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.740]   as one of the 10 most important people in standup comedy,
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:20.580]   without a doubt.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.920]   He changed the game.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.020]   It didn't exist like this before him.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.300]   And he won't accept that compliment.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.420]   - What was the gift you gave him?
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.380]   - I can't tell you.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.220]   - Is it a dildo?
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.060]   - It was a dildo.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.340]   It was a double-sided dildo.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.620]   I go, "Hey, when you get free time,
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.020]   "can we scissor fuck each other?"
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:40.060]   - You're happily married for 19 years.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.100]   So I think you're a good man to ask,
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.420]   how do you find love?
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.020]   How do you find, how do you date
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.900]   in order to find a love of your life, of a lifetime?
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:51.180]   - This is gonna sound off.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:57.180]   But don't tie yourself down.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.740]   Meaning like, don't spend time
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.380]   fucking with those little mini shrimp
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.780]   and peeling them every night
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.940]   when you know you're looking for a lobster.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:07.780]   - Yeah.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.540]   - And so I think what happens to a lot of guys,
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.620]   they're so busy and just getting pussy
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.100]   and going from here to here to here.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.100]   I was never that guy.
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.460]   I always wanted to find someone who understood me.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.020]   I always wanted that.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.500]   And so, granted, I haven't had sex with a lot of chicks,
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.140]   but that's, and it's not by choice.
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.140]   I'm saying maybe there was times I would have done it,
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.740]   but I know that I was always looking for someone
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.900]   to figure out, to get me.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.580]   And then I will say this, when you know, you know.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.060]   When you know, you know.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.420]   When you think there's,
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:43.740]   I can't imagine a life without this person.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:47.300]   That happened to me, and I can only say my experiences.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:52.100]   I had Leanne, I loved her, and I didn't even realize it.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.460]   And the second she dumped me, I went, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.220]   Oh, I don't get to live a great life without her.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.620]   She's the thing that's gonna give me a great life.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.580]   I knew it, undisputed.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.260]   I went for a run, and she dumped me.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.060]   I went to my shower, I cried.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:07.900]   I went to Barnes & Noble.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.620]   I bought men are from Venus, women are from Mars.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.340]   I watched Fight Club in my closet.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.180]   I didn't drink.
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.780]   I drank a lot of NyQuil to sleep.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.420]   And then I went for a hike in Runyon Canyon.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.860]   I was running back down Outpost by Benaflex House,
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.980]   and the sun was setting, and I just said,
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:28.780]   God, if you're listening, just give me this chick back.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.380]   I'll never fuck it up.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.300]   This is the one.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.580]   I won't fuck it up.
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.580]   I won't cheat.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.180]   I'm not gonna be a bad dude.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.660]   I won't have kids with her.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.500]   I'll be there.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.300]   I'll be a great fucking dude.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.820]   I'll take her out on dates.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.020]   Like, I'll love this chick.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.660]   And I got home, and she was in my room in a sundress.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.100]   And I was like, oh, fuck you.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.580]   I didn't know he was real.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.700]   I was like, shit, man, give me like one more night.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.420]   Let me get some strange tail real quick
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.580]   before I commit forever.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.780]   But I think when you know, you know.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.660]   This is so silly, but I follow that in business.
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.260]   Like, when you know, you know,
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.500]   and like my assistant's with us,
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.260]   and someone goes, how do you find a good assistant?
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.460]   I go, when you know, you know.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.220]   Like, people will show you who they are.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.380]   I can tell you when I fell in love with my assistant.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.660]   We were doing a TV show, and we worked past dinner,
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.660]   and all the dinner places were closed.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.380]   And he just said, hey, I got like four meals.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.220]   I didn't know which one you'd want,
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.260]   so I got four different meals for you.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.820]   I ordered them, they're up in your room,
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:25.980]   and just let me know whichever you want,
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.500]   and I'll take care of the rest of them.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.020]   And I was like, oh, that dude thinks
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.820]   about other people before himself.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.460]   He didn't even get himself dinner.
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.980]   He just got me four dinners, and I was like, fuck.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.100]   I did the same thing with my social media manager.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.660]   The way she was operating was, I was like,
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.140]   I feel like she's thinking about me.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.700]   And we connected on so many levels,
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.020]   on so many levels, I could talk to her
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.060]   about things and ideas I had,
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.620]   and then I was like, okay, I want her, I want him.
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.620]   I want, I think it's gotta be that thing,
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:53.500]   when you know, you know.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.300]   And it can be so simple as like,
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:00.460]   like a personal trainer, or like a jujitsu class,
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.620]   or like, just where you go, oh, I'm connecting right now.
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.340]   - But you have to allow yourself to notice that person.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.700]   - You, I think you do.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.620]   I mean, I think you have to put yourself out there,
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.500]   and you have to be available for it, you know?
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.780]   That's the hardest part, is just being available for it.
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.740]   'Cause so many people just wanna be busy just dating.
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:20.780]   I just wanna have someone in my life,
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:21.860]   I don't wanna be bored, I don't wanna,
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.220]   what if I die alone?
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.380]   I don't wanna, I like, just be available for it.
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.780]   - What is it you said, peeling the baby shrimp?
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:29.620]   - Yeah.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.380]   - When you could be having a lobster?
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.540]   Lobster's still a lot of work, I have to say.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:37.380]   - Yeah, but, well, yeah, but it's lobster.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.700]   If this is a fucking baby shrimp, or like,
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.220]   you ever get the ones in Brazil,
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.620]   where you just go, fuck it, I'll eat the shell.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.180]   I don't care anymore.
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.180]   Like, I'm so fucking hungry,
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.780]   and you just handful a lobster like it's popcorn,
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.540]   or baby shrimp like it's popcorn.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.300]   I've done that in Vietnam, I've done that,
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.660]   where I just go, it's too much work.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.660]   - So when you're in it,
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.540]   what's the secret to a successful marriage?
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.700]   What do women want, Burk Reischer?
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.540]   - Oh, fuck, I'm the wrong guy to answer that.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.380]   I think--
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.620]   - How to make love to a woman, by Burk Reischer.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.900]   - How do you make love to a woman?
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.260]   I'll tell you how I do it.
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.100]   - Meh.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.340]   - I go down on her first.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.740]   Make sure she has an orgasm.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:17.580]   - Yeah.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.700]   - And then I get my turn, and that's over pretty quick.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.540]   It's like, your ears pierce,
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.180]   and you feel a little prick, and it's over.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.020]   - Yeah.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:32.140]   - I don't know if I've done a great job keeping her happy.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.060]   I think I keep her interested.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:40.060]   Like, I think I keep her occupied.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.580]   I'm like a little bit of a rodeo clown.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.340]   Like, I don't know, I mean,
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:47.860]   I know we're happy right now, I know we're really happy,
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:52.860]   but I don't know if I ever did as good a job as she did.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:58.700]   Like, she's always been a gangster.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.500]   Like, did everything, just does everything.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.420]   She does it all, she does everything.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.020]   Like, fucking everything, and she loves it,
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.260]   she just does it.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.580]   And then she shows love for you by taking care of you.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.820]   And so, like, I have a lot of times just been this,
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.300]   like, almost like step and repeat husband,
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.580]   where it's like I come in to take a picture,
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.700]   like, "Hey, Monday, Tuesday, all right,
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.700]   "I'm on the road Wednesday, take care, guys."
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.820]   Or like, travel channel, I'd leave for two weeks at a time.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.540]   I left for the movie for three months.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:29.540]   So like, I don't know that I've ever done a bang up job.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:33.700]   I buy it, like, I go, I remember one time I was just like,
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.020]   I don't cheat on her, I don't hit her, I don't yell at her.
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.980]   I'm a pretty good fighter, I'm a really good fighter.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.700]   Like, I'm good at like, going like,
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.660]   "Hey, we're on the same team."
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.260]   - Oh, you mean de-escalation.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.300]   - I'm really good at like, I'm very self,
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.700]   I'm very accountable, I'm very self-correcting.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.140]   Like, if we're in a fight and she points something out
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.420]   and I go, "Oh, you're right."
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.900]   I go, "Fuck, you're right about that, you're right,
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:56.740]   "you're totally right."
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.580]   - Oh, in the moment.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.500]   - In the moment, I'm really good at that.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.660]   And my wife's not, she's not a good apologizer.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.100]   Like, she needs to sleep on an apology
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:04.940]   and then she can do it.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.860]   I can apologize in the moment if I realize I'm wrong.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:11.060]   And I'm really quick to find my fault.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:11.900]   - Yeah.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.740]   - I look for my fault, 'cause I go,
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.740]   "Tell me what I did."
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:19.300]   Adversely, as a parent, I have pulled my daughters aside
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.500]   and been like, "Yo, that wasn't you, that was mom."
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.340]   - Yeah.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.300]   - "I'm giving you a heads up."
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.740]   'Cause I don't want, 'cause I got really confused as a kid
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:31.180]   'cause my dad always made sure I knew I was wrong.
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.460]   And sometimes I wasn't.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.300]   - Yeah.
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.140]   - And then as a kid, you're kind of fucked up.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.220]   And you're like, "Well, how do I know if I'm wrong?"
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.180]   And I think that raises, so I was really good
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.180]   with my girls going like, "Yo."
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.540]   And then, and then parenting Georgia taught me a lot
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.740]   about self-correcting.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:43.900]   - Self-correcting was that?
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.300]   - Yeah, self-correcting was my oldest.
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.060]   I'd only, I parented like my dad parented.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.420]   Like, just like, "Raise your voice, get up to here.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.580]   "That's it, no, that does it, fuck this.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.980]   "How come the dogs don't have goddamn leashes
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.980]   "or collars on their necks?"
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.700]   And so with Georgia, I had to learn through therapy
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:05.700]   that if the consequence is here
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.700]   and the highest it goes is here,
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.340]   then why the fuck wouldn't they lie and do everything?
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.900]   'Cause they go, "Well, I know what it's like to hear,
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:14.980]   "you know, the consequence with a child
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.500]   "and find some conversation in it."
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.220]   Then all of a sudden they're like, "Well, fuck.
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.460]   "Well, I don't wanna lie 'cause this does suck.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.180]   "I like this, I like where we talk."
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.820]   And he says, "Write a thousand words
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:30.780]   "on why driving around your kids in a car is bad."
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:32.940]   - So threaten extreme violence every once in a while,
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.140]   just to--
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.500]   - Yeah, let 'em know the dog can fucking bite.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.500]   The dog can bark, the dog can bite,
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.100]   but if you pet him on his belly, he'll wag its tail.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:41.940]   - Yeah.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.780]   Do you worry about being away too much?
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:50.340]   I mean, you're one of the most creative content pushers
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.700]   and creators out there.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:52.940]   You're just constantly innovating,
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.100]   constantly putting stuff out there,
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.180]   but do you worry that pulls you away
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:59.820]   from the mundane experience of life
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.740]   that can bring contentment and happiness?
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.940]   - Yeah, I feel like sometimes it cannibalizes your real life
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.380]   where you start going, you start thinking in promo videos,
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.940]   or you start looking at a vacation as a bit.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.340]   We should go ziplining.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:17.340]   Well, Ida, why don't you do, what shoes are you wearing?
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.220]   It can definitely cannibalize your life.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:25.220]   My wife's really good at going like, "No."
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.020]   Like, "No phones."
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:27.980]   The girls are really good.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.620]   The girls, when I started Instagramming stuff,
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.940]   they started saying stuff like, "Dad hits mom."
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.220]   And I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys."
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.740]   They're like, "No, put your phone away."
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.260]   Dad and Les boys, and I'm like,
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.900]   "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop."
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:43.020]   - Yeah, what are some secrets,
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.340]   words of wisdom you can say for how to be successful online
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.300]   and everything you've learned?
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.060]   You're kind of like the Mr. Beast of comedy,
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:55.940]   just innovating constantly in terms of how to promote stuff,
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.620]   in terms of how to present stuff
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.500]   across the different social media,
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.260]   across YouTube, podcasts, all that stuff.
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:06.180]   - I think the number one thing is don't be afraid to suck.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.620]   No one sees the shit that sucks.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.780]   Doesn't get views.
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:11.780]   - It just gets forgotten.
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.100]   - Yeah, it gets forgotten.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.060]   The good stuff, they remember,
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.740]   and then that's all they bring up.
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.100]   The stuff that sucks just goes away,
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:18.540]   and they're like, "Oh yeah, did you do that?
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.780]   "I don't even think I saw that.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.380]   "Fuck it, who cares?"
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.420]   You know, it's like I watched,
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.740]   one of my favorite stories about this
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:30.180]   is a guy named Sean Patton.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.660]   I was explaining Instagram stories
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.140]   to him and Ari and Mark Norman,
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.900]   and I was explaining that you can now sell tickets
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.900]   on Instagram stories.
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.260]   It was back when they swiped up,
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.300]   instead of tap the button, swipe up.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:41.340]   And they didn't understand it.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.380]   And I said, "Let me show you."
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.740]   And I put up tickets for sale,
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.460]   and I said, "Hey guys, swipe up."
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.660]   And then I just showed him in 10 minutes,
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:48.900]   look, this is how many people swiped up.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.420]   It was 145 people.
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.400]   That's a lot of people to buy tickets
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.460]   for a fucking comedy club.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.460]   And they were like, "Whoa."
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:55.820]   And they're like, "What do you do stories about?"
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.460]   I go, "Fucking anything, who gives a shit?
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:00.420]   "Just anything, and some things work, some things don't."
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.820]   And I watched Sean Patton, shout out to Sean Patton,
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.940]   try for about 15 minutes to do an Instagram story
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.620]   about his cup of tea.
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.900]   He was making a cup of tea, and he was making,
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.100]   and he kept going, "Hey, okay, hold on, hold on."
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.700]   I was filming him from the couch.
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:17.540]   I was filming all these attempts.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.380]   - The whole thing, yeah.
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.220]   - I filmed every single one of them.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.980]   I have like 15 different stories of him trying to do that.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.140]   I had 145,000 views on each story.
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.140]   He never posted it.
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.980]   He never posted it.
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.900]   And I was like, "Man, if he had just posted that one."
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.700]   He never posted anything in his stories.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.700]   That one, 145,000, 5,000 people would have gone
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.420]   to his story to see that cup of tea being made
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.260]   and see which one he finally went with.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:41.780]   And so sometimes I think the biggest mistake you can make
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.380]   is just not doing it.
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:44.960]   Just do it, just post it.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.860]   Turn the camera on, the idea will show up.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.820]   And that's the number one thing.
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.420]   Just turn the camera on and it'll come up.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.420]   You'll figure it out.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.060]   - Do you do multiple takes or no?
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.140]   - Maybe I do three.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:57.300]   Like, and I'm talking even like in the dance video I did,
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.060]   where I did the hip hop dance, I did two takes on that.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.980]   When I had the marching band come to my house,
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.280]   I did two takes on that.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.860]   Once you start doing more takes,
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.340]   you lose the fun of it, I think.
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:14.780]   And then the fun ones, I mean, my favorite one I've ever done
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:19.460]   without a doubt, my favorite promo I've ever done is
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:23.820]   I needed, they added a second show in some city.
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:28.420]   And they added a second show like Friday and Saturday,
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:29.860]   and our third show.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.180]   And I said, they just told me, I was like,
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.700]   fuck, I'm leaving like tomorrow, I need to sell tickets.
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.420]   So I said, real quick, girls, meet me outside.
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.540]   And Leanne's like, girls are doing homework,
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.980]   I gotta go take five seconds.
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.260]   I put on a Speedo, I got the American flag.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.980]   I gave Isla the hose, I gave Leanne the leaf blower,
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.020]   and I gave Georgia the drone.
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:48.940]   And I just had Georgia drone it back to reveal
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.260]   the leaf blower and the mist you were seeing
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.900]   was coming from Isla and Leanne.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.580]   I'm in a Speedo with the American flag.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:58.600]   I have Bob Seger playing, rambling, grambling man.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.440]   - Yeah.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:03.520]   - And that night, Larry the cable guy texted me,
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.880]   and he goes, this is fucking genius.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.520]   And I was like, it was just like,
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.760]   yo, let's just shoot something, who gives a fuck?
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.480]   Like just shoot something, just say something.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.440]   And put a little, just do a little movement into it.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.400]   And those are my, back in the, I used to be,
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:23.040]   I watched a bunch of my promo clips from back in the day.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:23.940]   I used to be really good.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:27.500]   Now it's like, I'm promoting so fucking many things.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:28.780]   I'm just like, I'm almost like,
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.480]   I'm exhausted about my promotions.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.880]   - Yeah, because the well can dry up in terms of ideas.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.880]   - Yeah, and it's like, how many times
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.040]   am I gonna show a picture of my ass?
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.720]   My ass sells really good.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.800]   Whatever my ass is on Instagram,
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.780]   fucking million views guaranteed, a million views.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.620]   - Your ass.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.800]   - And it's an active post.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.600]   Like people are like, I did the best one
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   I did the other day was where I superimposed
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.520]   my ass on my front, and it just looked beautiful.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.720]   - Yeah. - No views.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.720]   - Oh, so you-- - I think I reported.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.560]   - Oh, I see. - It looked like
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.880]   a front vagina.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.920]   - Oh, is that what it was?
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:02.760]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.120]   But like, but yeah, my ass.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.840]   - Ass sells. - Like I'm at a place
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.360]   right now where I am promoting,
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.680]   I'll be promoting this movie,
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.960]   I'll be promoting this movie until it goes to a streamer.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.480]   I'll be promoting it shamelessly.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.300]   I am proud of it.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.120]   I had a great time shooting it.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.560]   It's in theaters.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.120]   It'll be on video on demand.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.480]   It'll be on a streamer, I'm sure.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.480]   I don't know, but I'm sure.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.600]   I'm promoting "Fully Loaded," my summer festival
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.640]   with 19 different comics.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.040]   I'm promoting the "Tops Off" world tour
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.640]   that starts again this fall.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.200]   I'm promoting my cruise, the "Fully Loaded" cruise.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.840]   I'm promoting "Red Rocks."
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.120]   I'm promoting so many things
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.800]   that today was the very first time in my career
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.760]   where I said, in January, I'm gonna take a break.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.920]   I'm gonna take a break and go like,
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.240]   hey man, let's get your resting heart rate down.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.160]   Let's get some sleep.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.360]   Let's maybe take off like three months from drinking.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.960]   Like, let's just really slow it down.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.920]   And also not think, when you're thinking
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.640]   in promo all the time, it can be a little exhausting.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.080]   I mean, you think it's exhausting to look at my feed.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.600]   It's exhausting to be my feed.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:11.500]   I'm my feed.
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:15.200]   - And sometimes less is more.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:18.520]   One of the things that-- - Nope, nope, nope.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.240]   - One of the things that inspires me about "Rogan,"
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   for example, is he almost never does this kind of stuff.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:29.960]   - Yeah, yeah, and how seldomly he does his podcast.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:30.920]   'Cause you're right, less is more.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:31.760]   How often does he do it?
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.800]   Like once a month?
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   No, he does it three times a fucking week.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.320]   More is perfect.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.120]   - But for example, when he does like a story
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.240]   or something like this, he does one take.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.700]   It's kind of shitty.
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.120]   - It's the same take.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.800]   It's Elk with a bunch of jalapenos,
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.000]   a knife that he had sent to him by a fucking knife maker,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.520]   and him going, "Look at this.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.380]   "Look at this Traeger smoker.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.760]   "I reverse seared this.
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.600]   "This is what's great.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:58.420]   "Look at this.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.260]   "I'm about to put it in the butter.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.580]   "This is grass-fed butter.
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.760]   "This elk really raises my testosterone."
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.160]   Rogan is, you're right, with guys like Rogan,
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.800]   when he does do a story, they're a little precious.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.800]   - Yeah, and I don't think he's ever done a second take
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.800]   at any of those stories.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.640]   - No.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.640]   You have to really admire that.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.360]   If the shot is framed poorly, if the audio sucks,
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.800]   doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.480]   - Do you remember when he, this is like,
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.960]   I can get in the weeds on Rogan,
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.840]   and especially when it's Instagram.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.480]   Do you remember when he got his polar plunge
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.320]   and he couldn't sit in it in a minute?
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.680]   And then the next day, and then he must have gotten it
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.440]   on the internet bad.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.280]   He must have gotten it bad.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.360]   The next day, he sat in it for 20 minutes
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.800]   and he lowered his core temperature by like two degrees,
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.320]   and it took him like a month to get that back.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.040]   That is that fucking man.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.800]   What an interesting, you know, I told you at the beginning,
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:55.200]   we were just talking, I really enjoy,
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.280]   I draw inspiration from men I'm not like.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:02.200]   You, David Goggins, Cam Haines.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.560]   - Andrew Huberman.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.800]   - Huberman I love.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:11.000]   Fucking, I mean, there's so many guys like that, Rogan,
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.680]   Tim Kennedy, there are a lot of guys
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.200]   that are just very different men than me,
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.280]   and I love Jocko Wilnick.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:23.680]   Like I love reading their stuff
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:25.040]   or listening to their audio books
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.800]   or listening to their podcasts
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.000]   because I'm so not like that.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.360]   But that for me, when I add a little bit of that in my life,
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.480]   like I remember you went, I don't know what you were doing,
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.160]   but you were walking us through your day.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.720]   And it was so fascinating.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.000]   It was like, I ran eight miles today.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.240]   I listened to an audio book, I was running eight miles.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.720]   And then I came and I worked
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.160]   for about three hours straight on AI stuff.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.960]   And I'm like, and I was like, wait, you sat at a desk?
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.280]   Like you like sat at a desk and like,
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:00.200]   and I actually, I wouldn't even know what to do.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.360]   I would start doing crafts.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:04.120]   Like I wouldn't, like that you went,
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.840]   I was like, is your computer like.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:09.600]   - Yeah, have you sat for like four hours
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.480]   focused on a single task?
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:13.320]   - Me?
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.160]   - Yeah.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.560]   (laughing)
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.000]   - Oh, I have a hard time sleeping for four hours.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.840]   - Yeah.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:22.920]   - Like I don't have that, I don't have a brain that like,
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.840]   I really admired it when I listened to you do it.
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.720]   'Cause then you were like, you were fasting at the time,
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.760]   you were doing your fast.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.840]   And then you talk about what you ate.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.120]   And I was jealous, I wanted to be able to be like that.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.200]   And I think at that time we started,
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.840]   I think you were doing maybe bone broth or something.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.960]   And we started doing bone broth pretty religiously
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:44.920]   and adding that into a fast 'cause I was like,
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.240]   it does, for someone like me,
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:49.320]   it does feel cool to add a little bit of control into life.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:53.320]   - So you, so integrating a little bit of a way of being
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.040]   from another person that you're not like.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:58.240]   - Yeah, like so David Goggins
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.200]   is consistently pushing himself.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.840]   I love, I did it over the pandemic more,
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.880]   but I loved going, today I'm running a marathon.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.080]   I'm gonna get on the treadmill
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.800]   and it's not gonna be all at once,
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.240]   but I'm gonna get through a marathon today.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.760]   So let's get up, get a six-ounce of coffee
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.040]   and let's see if we can do like five miles
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.160]   and then know that we started there.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.840]   And that was really fun to like,
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.760]   Cam Haines does that too, where he goes like,
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:29.000]   he almost just sets the limit and then achieves that.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.480]   His son Truett is really fascinating
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.680]   'cause his son Truett right now is trying to get the,
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.200]   and like, I bet people would never think
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.560]   that this is who I watch,
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.400]   but I get real inspiration from those people
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.880]   because I showed Jocko, I showed a clip to Jocko,
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.720]   to Isla, 'cause Isla's like me,
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:49.720]   like a person of her fluids, impulse.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:52.200]   I walked in on her one time,
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:57.160]   she was in the pantry in a bathrobe in the dark
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.440]   drinking a root beer.
[00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.280]   - Yeah.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.720]   - And I opened the door and she went,
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.560]   I said, "What?"
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.320]   She goes, "I thought you were mom, shut the door."
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.600]   And I shut the door to let her finish the root beer.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.720]   She has a hard time waking up.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.320]   So I go, "Isla, come in here.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.080]   "I want you to see this clip from Jocko."
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.880]   She goes, "Who's Jocko?"
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:14.880]   I say, "He's a Navy SEAL."
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.960]   She goes, "He works at the zoo?"
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.800]   I went, "No."
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.000]   (laughing)
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.720]   I said, "He's a Navy fucking SEAL."
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.880]   I go, "It's a badass job."
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.960]   She goes, "It's a silly name."
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.040]   And I went, "No, it's not, it isn't a silly name.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.360]   "These guys are the toughest dudes in the world."
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.200]   She goes--
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.400]   - She's kind of right though about the silly name.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.480]   I never even realized that.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.880]   - Well, yeah, you talk to a child.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.720]   - Yeah.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.600]   - And so I go, "Watch this, what he says about waking up."
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.080]   So I hit the thing and Jocko goes,
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.680]   "First thing you do when you hear that alarm clock,
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.380]   "you could roll over, you could go back to bed,
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.560]   "you could snooze, but you get out of bed
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.040]   "and that's your first victory."
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.360]   And Isla hits pause and she goes,
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.440]   "How great is that nap right after you hit snooze though?"
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.840]   I went, "It is pretty fun."
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.300]   I go, "Hang on, you're missing the point.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.000]   "You can listen to this whole speech."
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.040]   He's with Casey Neistat when he's telling this speech.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.760]   He's with Casey Neistat.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.400]   And so I hit it and then he goes,
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.680]   "And then you've got a victory under your belt.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.440]   "Then you go to the gym and you work out."
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.280]   And I go, "Are you listening to this, Isla?"
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.480]   And she goes, "Yeah."
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.680]   And he goes, "And then when you go to the work,
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.640]   "now you've got two victories.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.460]   "You've worked out and you've woken up on time.
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.860]   "You didn't hit that snooze button.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.240]   "So when you go into that break room and you see donuts,"
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.900]   and she hits pause, she goes,
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.840]   "If he's about to say no to donuts, I'm done listening."
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.200]   I go, "He's definitely gonna say no to donuts."
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.120]   "Do you think he's gonna have a donut?"
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.120]   And she goes, "You like this guy?"
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.120]   I go, "I fucking love him."
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.480]   And she goes, "Do you think he'd like you?"
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.760]   And I go, "What do you mean?"
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.340]   She goes, "Dad, you hit snooze, you skip working out
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.320]   "and you love donuts."
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.520]   And I'm like, "Yeah, you're making a good fucking point."
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.940]   I go, "But I do love that,
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.500]   "I love to watch that brain work and go,
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.000]   "I don't hit snooze.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.560]   "I don't hit snooze now."
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.600]   I go, "Fuck it, 'cause I'm up."
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.920]   And then I go to the gym every single morning.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.500]   I go to the gym every single morning.
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.080]   And today is National Donut Day.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.720]   I didn't have a donut.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.480]   And so I try to apply these a little bit,
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.400]   'cause I mean, the other side of me is like,
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.400]   tonight after we do this, I'll do another podcast
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.840]   and then I'm gonna call Leanne and go,
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.040]   "Yo, we're in Beverly Hills, meet me out here.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:06.880]   "Let's go have drinks.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.520]   "Let's go have fucking couple Campari Spritz.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.220]   "Ida's over at her friend's house in Oberlin,
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.060]   "let's get some edibles
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.420]   "and let's fucking have a night about it.
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.800]   "Get some sushi, go have sex in the hot tub.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.100]   "And I gotta work out at fucking 10 in the morning."
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:23.480]   - I gotta tell you, that nap when you press snooze.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.880]   - Is the sweetest.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.960]   - That's my victory, first victory is pressing snooze
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.760]   and getting the nap out of the belt.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.760]   - Have you ever had, I had,
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.040]   so this morning I didn't work out.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.280]   I'd press at like five in the morning until about six.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.480]   - You're going hard right now.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.600]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.440]   And then I had a podcast.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.240]   - I saw you flew to Austin.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.080]   I was like, what?
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:50.440]   Just run around theaters and now you're back.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.300]   - Yeah, run around theaters to promote the movie
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.840]   and then, look, you only get one shot at these movies,
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.680]   so you might as well do,
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.000]   and look, it's really hard to get people
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.640]   to go into a movie theater right now.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.600]   And so I woke up at like six,
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.520]   did five or six to seven, did press,
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.440]   and then I went and I said,
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.640]   and I'm really into history podcasts right now,
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.840]   and I was listening to this one about the conquistadors
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.160]   and I was like, when I woke up,
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.680]   I was like, I wouldn't mind going back to that.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.360]   And I said, I'll tell you what,
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.680]   I'm gonna take a little nap and go.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.000]   Now I slept good last night.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.560]   I slept like seven hours last night.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.000]   Boy, that 30 minute nap, it felt like five hours.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.560]   And I woke up going, I gotta readjust my sleep score.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.760]   That has to be in the 97.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.840]   That was the best fucking nap.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.440]   Those little snooze naps are monsters.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.880]   - You know, there's, I don't care.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.040]   That's probably for me,
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.260]   one of the peak experiences of life is those naps.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.400]   I don't know what that is.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.360]   - Have you ever slept in a tour bus?
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.880]   - A tour bus versus a regular bus?
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.720]   - Like a tour bus, like meaning like in a bunk.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.560]   - No.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.720]   I've taken a lot of buses in my life though.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.160]   - Like you mean like just like a Greyhound?
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.120]   Those are very different.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.640]   - And public transit.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.960]   Listen, they,
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:16.240]   that's just part of life in a Greyhound.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.080]   - I was on a Greyhound one time,
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.760]   I was on a Greyhound one time, right,
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.520]   when Notorious B.I.G.'s album came out in college
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.840]   and I was going from Tallahassee down to Tampa
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.800]   and the dude got on the tour bus,
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.440]   got on the bus next to me, black dude,
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.000]   and he sat down, he said,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:33.840]   "Where you headed?"
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.660]   And I said, "Tampa."
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:35.500]   He said, "You grew up in Tampa?"
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.340]   I said, "Yeah."
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:37.160]   He said, "You?"
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.000]   And he goes, "Yeah."
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:38.840]   I said, "You go to school with Fam?"
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.680]   And he goes, "Fam, you and Floris,
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.000]   "they're the two schools, one's black, one's white."
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.880]   And he goes, "No, I just got out of prison."
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.960]   I said, "You got out of prison?"
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.480]   And he goes, "Yeah."
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.640]   Yeah, man, I got out of prison.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.560]   I stabbed a dude and I've been in prison.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.400]   I just got out today.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.000]   He goes, "What are you listening to?"
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.680]   I said, "Notorious B.I.G."
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.880]   And he goes, "Oh, shit, that's out?"
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.720]   And I went, "Yeah."
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.560]   And he goes, "I wanna hear it, can I hear it?"
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.920]   And I was like, "Yeah."
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.880]   And he used my headset to the whole bus ride to Tampa.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.160]   I didn't have the, I was like, "He's stabbed a man,
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.240]   "they're yours now, I guess."
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.520]   And then I just sat next to him and I was like,
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520]   "Is he, are you enjoying it?"
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.280]   He's like, "This is good."
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.840]   No, tour bus naps.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.280]   - Yeah.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.200]   - When you're in a bunk, it's ice cold,
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.520]   bus isn't moving, five o'clock,
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.200]   like we work out from like up until like five o'clock,
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.920]   5.30, show starts at seven,
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.360]   but that five o'clock to six, 6.30 nap,
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:32.000]   it's pitch black, it's like a coffin.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.520]   And it is ice cold and you got all your pillows
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.520]   and blankets in there.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.600]   And you put a little history podcast on in the corner
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.320]   and you just listen to like Kurt Mombashi
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.120]   or like, oh my God.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.120]   - So you're talking about like 5.00, 6.00 p.m.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.400]   for a 7.00 p.m. show.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.240]   - Oh, it's the best nap you'll ever have.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.800]   You wake up so refreshed.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.640]   - Yeah.
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.720]   - Like I've woken up from naps,
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.080]   like where I'm like, fuck yeah.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.880]   Like those tour bus naps are the best naps.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.120]   - Yeah, I think having a full productive day
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:07.640]   and then like 5.00, 6.00 p.m. to get a nap
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:10.440]   and then you do something really stressful after that,
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.280]   like really hyper, like a show.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.960]   But if I do, like I really like doing podcasts
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.400]   like late at night after a nap.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.800]   I think I fucked up my podcast rhythm
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.680]   'cause we're doing them in the day.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.360]   And so sometimes I'm just like,
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.240]   like if I work out in the morning, I'm good on a podcast,
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.480]   but if I don't work out, I suck on a podcast.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.360]   I'm just like, uh-huh, yeah.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.200]   - Yeah.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.480]   - That's cool.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:38.480]   No, my favorite is, I used to do this a lot,
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.320]   I haven't done it in a while, is a full busy day,
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:47.720]   nap at home, box of wine on the treadmill
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.680]   and do that until like midnight.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.400]   Watching TV, box of wine.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.680]   - Box of wine on a treadmill.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.520]   - It's the best.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.320]   - How are you sipping it, Jake?
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.720]   - You have a glass, but you have a box.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.560]   The box fits on the corner on the treadmill.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.200]   So you just got a little spigot
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.160]   and you just sit there and just put on
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.440]   like guys' grocery games or like just something.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.280]   It's like a--
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.160]   - You walking or are you running?
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.360]   - I walk, I walk at like a 3.5.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.880]   So what'll happen is if you start at three,
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.280]   start at three, casual walk, 20 minutes,
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.120]   you're gonna mile in and then you're gonna feel loose.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.560]   You get up to a 3.5, you can do seven miles on these things
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.720]   and you're just enjoying your night.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.640]   Especially like my wife, back in the day
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.680]   when we lived in our old house,
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.920]   my wife would come into the man cave
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.200]   and she'd sit on the couch and we'd watch TV together
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.840]   and like watch Game of Thrones.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.840]   And you just like for an hour
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.160]   and you just get on the treadmill and do it.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.720]   Oh man, I loved.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.760]   Haven't done that as much lately.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.600]   That was the fucking best.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.720]   - So you can lose yourself, you can forget yourself.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.000]   - You forget you're on a treadmill
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.280]   and you just are like walking and you're sweating
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.920]   and you're having wine.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.080]   And then at certain points you're like,
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:52.320]   like you start jogging, especially like we were watching,
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.840]   not all quiet on the Western front.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.360]   What's the one where they've gotta get the message
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.040]   to the front line?
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.240]   I would run like I was in World War II.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.640]   I would run when they would run
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.920]   and it was fucking awesome.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.160]   And I would be like, 'cause they were doing drinks.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.520]   They'd be like, "Take a drink, you gotta run up there."
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.920]   And I'd be like, "Okay."
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.080]   Yeah, I'm really into history podcasts right now.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.960]   I've been in them for a while.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.000]   - 20th century or everything?
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:17.960]   - Everything, everything.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:22.960]   I listened to, was it Marcus Aurelius and Cleopatra?
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.440]   Today.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.160]   In the middle of the podcast, they're like,
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.680]   "Just so you know, Cleopatra wasn't as hot
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.520]   "as everyone says."
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.960]   I was like, "Why are you saying that?"
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.160]   Yeah, tell me she's a six, she looks like Snooki.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.320]   Like, let me dream that she looks like Kim Kardashian.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:42.680]   And then I listened to that one today.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.400]   I listened to World War II a lot.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:48.000]   A lot of books on World War II, a lot of podcasts about it.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.080]   - What's your favorite theater?
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.200]   The Pacific or European?
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.360]   - No, European.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.360]   Pacific, well, because my family,
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.320]   so much of it has died in that theater.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.320]   So, it's personal.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.160]   - So much of it.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.000]   - I hate to sound cliche, like a Marlon Schwartz thing
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.080]   in an '80s movie, but it's personal.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.720]   - Well, you know what I find funny about that?
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.560]   - Yeah.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.960]   - Is Lennon, it was Lennon, right?
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.800]   - John Lennon?
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:12.720]   - John Lennon.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.000]   - Lennon was World War II, right?
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:15.840]   Or was it Stalin?
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.760]   - Stalin.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.600]   - Stalin.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.000]   Stalin thought him and Hitler would be friends.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.880]   I think that's so cute that he was like,
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.480]   "We're gonna be buddies."
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.880]   Like, "We're boys."
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.840]   And then Hitler's like, "Oh, fuck you.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.760]   "I'm Hitler, bro.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:29.680]   "This is what I do."
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.720]   - Well, at first he was like, "Fuck yeah.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.200]   "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll be friends."
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.040]   - Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.040]   And then, "Call me, call me.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.480]   "Better yet, I'll show up in winter."
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.320]   How's that sound?
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.160]   (laughing)
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.000]   - Yeah.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   - And I find all of that so fascinating.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.960]   When I was a kid, I had a hard time understanding how,
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.200]   'cause we were always at war with Russia when I was a kid,
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.520]   and I had a hard time understanding
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.960]   how we could be on the same team as Russia in World War II.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.640]   And I was like, "Wait, how did that turn south?"
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.640]   And then you listen to podcasts.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:03.640]   Yeah, all of that, all of the World War II,
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.160]   I got really into the Pacific shit for a while,
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.160]   but I'm really deep in the whole,
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:19.080]   we went to Normandy from the Cliffs of Dover,
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.960]   and to think, "So that's the fucking beach.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.720]   "That's the fucking beach.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.520]   "Oh shit, this is cold as fuck.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.440]   "These dudes jumped in ice cold water.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.100]   "And this isn't like a cool beach.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:34.560]   "This is, and it's just so insane."
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.800]   And then to see the, it's pretty intense.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.600]   I don't know why I got into history late in life.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.960]   I was kind of into it, but I'm really into it now.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.160]   And I love just learning a little something about,
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.160]   today I listened to the, Noiser has a great history stuff.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.160]   It's like history for dummies, I think.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.860]   I can't listen to the really smart stuff.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:10:59.700]   It starts losing me.
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.200]   Too many names and I'm gone.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.700]   - Yeah, but Dan Carlin's always the best.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.600]   Your podcast with Dan Carlin was so fucking good.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:14.920]   I only know about Martin Luther because of Dan Carlin.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:16.960]   I only know.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.060]   I made a joke about some Lutheran the other day,
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.520]   and everyone laughed, and I was like,
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.120]   "Did you guys listen to the same podcast I did?"
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.120]   Because I just am quoting Dan Carlin.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:31.400]   His podcast, we all quoted the same shit about Genghis Khan
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.480]   about how he could shoot a dove off a horseback,
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:40.800]   but we knew that all four hoofs had to be off the ground
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.100]   at the same time they shot.
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.400]   They would sometimes take their meat
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.560]   and stick it under their saddles.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.760]   And that, I mean, Dan Carlin is, he is the motherfucker.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.600]   - Yeah.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.520]   - God, those were, man,
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.840]   discovering podcasts was the coolest time of my life.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.680]   - And the interesting thing about him is it's audio.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.560]   And so it's the voice.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.360]   So for me, I mean, everybody has a story
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.720]   with a prostitute in a motel.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.520]   Dan Carlin was my prostitute in the motel.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.840]   I invited him to a motel.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.800]   I don't even remember, in the middle of nowhere,
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.640]   he shows up with that voice, and the rest is history.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.480]   - So good.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.920]   - Things that we'll never know what happened.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.760]   - 'Cause he liked you.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.360]   - Oh boy, did he like, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.520]   I'm really running with it.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.760]   (laughing)
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.160]   Yes, we did, we got along really.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.960]   I mean, he's an incredibly kind and thoughtful person,
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.120]   constantly self-critical,
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.320]   thinking he's not good enough.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.640]   He just works on those episodes forever.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.960]   - Forever.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.460]   - And he just thinks that there's these,
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.520]   just like with Goggins,
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:45.520]   there's these other historians that I think weigh on him,
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.600]   like they're going to judge him or something like this.
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600]   - Really? - In his mind.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.400]   - I talked to him about Daniel Batali,
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.560]   and I guess his thing is,
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.640]   I guess his hangup is, Carlin's is,
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.320]   he's not like this,
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.880]   he doesn't feel like he's a real historian, but he is.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.360]   I mean, the way he shares the story,
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.400]   look, we had a history teacher in seventh grade
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.940]   who was a con artist,
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.080]   and he came and taught our seventh grade,
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.920]   and it was a total con artist.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.680]   All he taught us about was barnstorming,
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.480]   barnstorming and the JFK assassination.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.680]   I walked away having such an appreciation
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:26.520]   for barnstorming, a very small blip on Americana,
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.760]   but I know a lot about barnstorming because of this guy,
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.200]   and because he was passionate about barnstorming.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.800]   It was the funnest seventh grade history class
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.440]   I'll ever take in my entire life.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.440]   - You mentioned tour bus,
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.920]   what's the best road trip you've been on?
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.160]   Have you driven across the country, just you?
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.000]   - No.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.120]   We had one road trip in college
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.880]   where a bar had burned down,
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.520]   and we found out that the alcohol was still in the bar.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.600]   So we took my Jetta over to the bar,
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.480]   and we emptied out the bar of all the burnt up liquor.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.000]   We didn't know what anything was.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.800]   We threw it into the trunk with no clothes,
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.200]   like no clothes, and we said, "Let's just start driving."
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.080]   And we drove from Tallahassee
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.840]   and ended up in West Virginia, and just drove.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.580]   Just drove, it was like five dudes.
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:19.840]   We drank, one person drove.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.400]   I wasn't a big drinker, and this sounds crazy,
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.600]   I wasn't a big drinker in college until I went to Russia.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.880]   And so I drove the majority of the way,
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.400]   and then we'd get somewhere,
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.120]   and we'd get a hotel room.
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.480]   And it was one of the most epic fucking weekends
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.400]   of just debauchery and chaos.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.640]   And I think we took mushrooms,
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:45.440]   and we went down a river in tubes.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.480]   - So it's most about the bond between the five people.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.320]   - Five dudes.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.520]   - Versus throwing yourself into meeting strangers
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.480]   and this kind of stuff.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.640]   - Yeah, and it was when I was trying
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.880]   to be a poet at that time.
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.680]   And so we were-- - Actual poetry?
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.120]   - Yeah, it was a really bad part of my life.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.800]   - Well, music is there too somewhere.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.280]   - Yeah, I tried to be in a band too.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.280]   That didn't work out the way I wanted it to.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.840]   I just was never, I always was,
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.680]   I was never the, I'm not a good serious person.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.900]   Like I'm a good funny person.
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:14.120]   I'm good to be the fool, but I'm not good,
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.880]   when I try to be serious, it looks foolish.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.440]   And so even like, someone showed me
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.920]   throwing out the first pitch the other day at something,
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.800]   and all I could see is my gut flying everywhere,
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.880]   and I was like, that's why it went viral.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.720]   I was like, fuck, I thought it was my throwing style.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.720]   That was a pretty epic one.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.760]   The best road trips I ever took was during the pandemic.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.640]   During the pandemic when we were,
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.080]   when we were doing that drive-in movie theater tour.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.500]   I created a drive-in movie theater tour
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.080]   when no one was working.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.360]   And the very first one, we all,
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.560]   no one had left their houses.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.960]   We all went to my house, we got my tour bus.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.360]   We had just wrapped, the day the tour bus showed up,
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.360]   we just wrapped the cabin,
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:58.560]   just wrapped doing the cabin on Netflix.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.880]   And we got COVID tested.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.120]   We got in the tour bus and we said,
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.080]   let's create our bubble and stay safe.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.520]   And that night we drove, I think just outside Gallup,
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:13.400]   and we stayed in a, and no one had been outside.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.040]   And we stayed at a KOA, camp on arrival,
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.360]   and we watched thunderstorms come in on a lake.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.640]   And we were all smoking cigars and drinking IPAs.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.120]   And it was fucking mad.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.680]   And that whole road trip,
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.880]   we road tripped across the country to start the tours.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.240]   And then we just, and we were outside for the first time.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:37.400]   And we were, and it was that period of my life.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.300]   I'm so grateful.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.400]   I didn't make a ton of money 'cause we had a big crew
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.920]   and I made sure, I was trying to make sure everyone,
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.120]   'cause no one had paid bills in a while.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.880]   But that fucking tour was the funnest.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.680]   We took up pickleball, we took up disc golf,
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.760]   everything was wide open.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.120]   In the middle of the country, you could do things,
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.720]   but we were still in our bubble.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.080]   And we lived in that tour bus.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.520]   And at night, we'd just get back in the tour bus by ourselves
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.600]   and get fucking wasted.
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:07.680]   And I mean, that fucking run,
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.080]   it'll, nothing will ever be like that.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.160]   - Yeah, because you like rediscovered the humanity,
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.560]   the camaraderie, because the pandemic kind of killed that.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:18.360]   They suffocated us from like the basic connection.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.800]   - Yeah, and there was this,
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.840]   you always had an anxiety attack halfway through
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.440]   that you got COVID, and this is when COVID
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.520]   was killing people.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.480]   And you were like, "I know I've got COVID."
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.960]   And then we'd come in to Sedona.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.640]   And this is also why I didn't make a ton of money.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.040]   We'd come into Sedona and we'd get a house in Sedona
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.640]   for five days, an Airbnb, and we'd all isolate there
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.400]   before we went home to our families.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.240]   - Yeah.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.440]   - I remember the first time we did it, we didn't isolate.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.680]   We just pulled back into LA
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.320]   and all our families were freaked out.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.000]   So I had to stay, live on the tour bus
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.600]   in at a different house.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.600]   And it was 4th of July, and I came in
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.200]   and they were doing an egg toss.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.800]   And they're like, "Well, you can do an egg toss."
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.520]   Then this is how bad my anxiety gets.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.000]   "You can do an egg toss with your daughter, Isla."
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.360]   So Isla and I did an egg toss,
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.880]   and we fucking got it to like legit,
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.320]   like 40 fucking feet where I was throwing overhand,
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.120]   lobbing them to her.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.000]   And the egg cracked in her hands and it broke over her face.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.560]   And I got in bed that night, high on,
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.600]   weed, fucking drunk.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.840]   And I went, "What if I gave my daughter COVID
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.480]   "from an egg toss?"
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.280]   I go, "That would be the most horrific way
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.040]   "to kill a child."
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.200]   And she got it from an egg toss.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.040]   It broke in her face.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.320]   Her dad did COVID, yeah.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.700]   - I mean, that's the scariest thing about COVID,
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.880]   I think, is not you dying,
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:40.120]   but because of you, somebody else dies.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:40.960]   - Oh, I got it.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:44.480]   - That's the fear I think that really
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.080]   like took hold on people.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.840]   That's why they were way more cautious
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.320]   than perhaps they needed to be.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.920]   It's just like, I don't wanna be the guy
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.440]   that's responsible for killing somebody I love
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.520]   or somebody that somebody else loves.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.840]   - Leanne gave everyone in our family COVID.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:04.040]   She came up to me and she gave me a hug after Christmas
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.720]   and gives me a hug.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:08.560]   I said, "What's the matter?"
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.960]   And she goes, "I think I have COVID."
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.760]   I go, "Bitch, six feet.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760]   "The fuck you doing?"
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:13.760]   Back it up, Fauci.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.240]   Like fucking, and then she, we went,
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:19.440]   we went, oh, and then she had it and it went away
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.440]   and we're all fine.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.720]   And we're like, "Okay."
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.200]   We're like, "We can still go to Park City."
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.500]   So we all go to Park City.
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.200]   Then Georgia gets COVID.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.320]   And then Georgia starts crying.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.760]   And she goes, "I think I gave you COVID."
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.600]   And I was like, "I'm fine."
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.600]   She goes, "You're at high risk."
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.420]   And I'm like, "What?"
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:32.720]   She's like, "You're a fat alcoholic."
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:33.560]   I'm like, "Whoa, easy.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.480]   "Where the fuck, what about feelings?"
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.040]   And then Georgia got COVID.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.600]   Me and Isla were still in Park City.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.680]   Leanne had it.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.640]   My tour bus came up, picked George up.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.880]   George and Leanne took him back to LA.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:46.120]   And I was, Isla and I were there and I tested.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:49.440]   And then we get on the plane and I cough
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.800]   and Isla's got her mask on.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.520]   Isla just looks at me, you know, the best.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.800]   The one thing we miss are the eyes over masks.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.960]   The, and then we get home and I had COVID.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.960]   And Isla's like, "If you gave me fucking COVID."
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.200]   And then she never got COVID.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.200]   She never got COVID.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.560]   - You mentioned IPAs.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:09.680]   What's the lay of the land of great beers
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.760]   in this expansive world of ours?
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.720]   - I like pilsners.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.600]   I'm a pilsner guy.
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.360]   I'm an ice cold beer guy.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.600]   - Ice cold pilsner.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.320]   - I like an ice cold beer.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.640]   I like an ice cold.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.700]   One of the best beer buzzes I ever had is,
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:28.280]   we had bought a new house, but we weren't building it.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.740]   And over COVID, I didn't drink for like three months,
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:34.320]   four months, until we decided to go back out on tour.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.520]   And we figured that out.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.160]   And I was in the backyard and Leanne came back
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.520]   with like two tall boy, German pilsners and cracked them.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:42.960]   She goes, "Let's have a beer."
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.880]   And I was like, "Fuck yeah."
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:47.880]   And man, that second, that beer buzz
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.440]   is different than anything.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.960]   The second it touches you, you feel the sparkle
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.680]   and you're just like, "Yeah, baby, I'm back."
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.360]   And then she's like, "You want another one?"
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:00.120]   I'm like, "Fuck yeah."
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:00.960]   And then we have another one.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.360]   And then that beer buzz is,
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.560]   especially afternoon beer buzz, is just so pretty.
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.840]   It's different than a night beer buzz.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.040]   A night beer buzz is like, "Oh, I guess we'll have a beer
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:11.880]   and then I'll have a couple.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.700]   I gotta go to work tomorrow.
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:13.540]   All right."
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:18.040]   But that afternoon, irresponsible beer buzz, pilsner.
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.120]   Pilsner, I don't mind an IPA,
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:23.560]   but I gotta be at somewhere.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.680]   I gotta be at somewhere.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.160]   They gotta have an IPA, like a local IPA.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.940]   There's gotta be food involved.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:31.120]   And then I'm enjoying an IPA.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:36.120]   I threw up an IPA in a bathtub in Salt Lake City one time.
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.280]   It was bad.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.100]   - What do you mean?
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:40.280]   Oh, you threw up in the bathtub, okay.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.120]   - No, no, no.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.360]   I was drinking in the bathtub.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.280]   - Like bathtub with some water in it?
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.200]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.120]   - You're sitting in a bathtub.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.880]   - No, I'm getting ready to take a shower.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.800]   And I had a growler of IPA.
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.600]   It's about six in the morning.
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.200]   I have to fly that day to Vegas
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.280]   to jump off the stratosphere.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.260]   All I need is a little bit of a buzz
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.920]   to get myself on this fucking plane.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.320]   I have anxiety going through my fucking head
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.640]   'cause I'm gonna be the first person
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.340]   to jump off the stratosphere.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:06.880]   And so I'm drinking an IPA out of a growler
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.780]   in a bathtub at six in the morning.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.720]   And it just didn't sit right.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:12.640]   And I threw it up.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.080]   And I was off IPAs for like 10 fucking years.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:19.640]   I didn't have another IPA until I was like 46.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.440]   'Cause I was like, all I could think about
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.420]   was throwing up that IPA in a bathtub,
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:25.760]   in a shower and being like,
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:28.720]   "I'm gonna throw up thinking about it."
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.680]   But yeah, I didn't fuck with IPAs for a while.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.680]   And then during the pandemic, I got back into IPAs.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.480]   - I was that way with Jack and Coke,
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.060]   Jack Daniels and Coke.
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:37.900]   - Really?
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.020]   - I was so drunk many, many years ago
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:43.820]   that just couldn't look at it for a few years.
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:48.620]   - I can't touch, what's Janis Joplin's drink?
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:49.460]   Southern Comfort.
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:50.580]   I can't touch Southern Comfort.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:52.340]   - She's just drinking straight?
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:53.660]   But Southern Comfort is at 40%.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:54.500]   That's hard, right?
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.220]   - No, it's almost like a liqueur.
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:57.860]   Honestly, it's really sweet.
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:01.340]   Jack, Double Jack on the Rocks, lots of rocks.
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:02.340]   I mean, I had a quote that,
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.740]   I got a video that went viral about,
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:06.360]   "I'll never quit drinking."
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:09.620]   And I have not gotten on a plane since that
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.860]   without having a flight attendant
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.580]   not even ask what I want.
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:15.060]   Walk up with a Double Jack on the Rocks, lots of rocks.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.300]   I mean, it happens.
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.660]   So on times I don't wanna drink.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:19.500]   - Yeah.
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:20.320]   - I flew to Austin the other day,
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.220]   I was like, "I'm not drinking."
[01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:23.500]   On the plane, 'cause I felt sick.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.880]   And man, he walked up and he goes,
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.340]   "Double Jack on the Rocks, lots of rocks."
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.700]   I was like, "Fuck, you know it."
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:29.540]   - Yeah.
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:30.920]   - But yeah, that's my drink.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.940]   Wait, what's your drink?
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:35.500]   I thought you'd be a vodka guy.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:41.480]   - Well, vodka I associate with a lot of moments
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.040]   in my life of happiness.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:47.280]   Because vodka is associated with shots and camaraderie.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.240]   And there's Eastern Europe in general.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.720]   A bunch of guys get together
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.320]   and you celebrate life intensely.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.160]   - Yeah.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.600]   - People fight, people just feel,
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.120]   people experience life in a deep way.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.620]   You just get too drunk for a reason.
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:09.380]   But I don't see that as drinking drinking.
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:13.100]   That's like a journey towards a destination.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:17.160]   To me, drinking is like whiskey neat.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.980]   Or beer, like you said, ice cold beer.
[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:19.820]   - Yeah.
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:21.180]   - There's that afternoon beer.
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.140]   For a person like me,
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:25.340]   who's extremely regimented and disciplined,
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:28.380]   sometimes you get to a situation.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:29.300]   I just remember, I mean,
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:31.740]   I remember there's a bar at MIT
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.580]   where I just remember in the afternoon,
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:35.100]   there was a business meeting.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.380]   I sat down, we started with a beer.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:41.860]   And they were really crisply cold, some kind of lager.
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.860]   And then just one beer and two beers.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.100]   And all of a sudden you say, fuck it.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:49.740]   Let's just, the rest of the day, this is what this is.
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:51.020]   And you said, Bright,
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:54.940]   nature is beautiful out there.
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:57.460]   And you just said, fuck it to all the meetings.
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:59.260]   Fuck it to everything else.
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.620]   Just the camaraderie,
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:04.580]   the just talking about life, being silly,
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.020]   being all of that.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.900]   - See, you're describing something I'll never get.
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:10.220]   'Cause I'm not regimented.
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:13.780]   I would love, I would love,
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.660]   I would love, only for the moment that you get to have.
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:19.220]   You get the most precious little angel's breath
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:20.500]   that anyone's gonna get.
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.740]   Because you live this life that's dialed in
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.060]   and it's scheduled.
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:27.300]   And so when you say, fuck it,
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:29.380]   it's like, that's like me doing coke.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:31.020]   Like, it's like, oh, fuck it.
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.500]   And you can just do that with beer.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.980]   That is fucking amazing.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:39.140]   I would love to live a regimented life
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:41.660]   just to get the chance to go,
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:44.740]   hey guys, I'm not performing surgery today.
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:46.380]   Fuck it.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.740]   Hey guys, this bus full of kids,
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.700]   kid's gotta drive itself home.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:51.860]   Fuck it.
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.940]   I couldn't even tell you,
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.740]   you know what's so interesting about me and you
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:58.900]   is like, you know I'm a fan of yours.
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:01.380]   I couldn't even, I don't really know what AI is.
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:05.300]   Other than like, dildos are AI, right?
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.940]   - Like if it has some electronics in it.
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:10.500]   - Yeah, if it has electronics it's--
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.300]   - No, I don't think a dildo classifies as a robot.
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:14.980]   - 'Cause I thought that's how they were gonna take over
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:16.180]   fucking mankind.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:19.540]   Well, they start with the fucking womanizer
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:20.580]   that knows how to eat a pussy
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:22.220]   and then they're like, we don't need men anymore.
[01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:24.980]   But it's so interesting that I couldn't even,
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:27.460]   like I can barely tell you what my dad does for a living.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:29.180]   He's a lawyer, I could kind of,
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.140]   like he's called me and said,
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.580]   hey man, you gotta stop talking about what I do
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.220]   'cause you're not doing it right.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:34.060]   I go, what do you mean?
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:36.940]   He's like, whatever you're saying I do, I don't do.
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:40.060]   And so, but like I couldn't even begin
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:42.180]   to explain your job to my daughter.
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:45.700]   - Well, I think there's the way you do the job
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.820]   which is the way you experience life,
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:51.940]   the regimented, even just a nine to five job, right?
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:52.820]   - Do you work nine to five?
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:55.900]   - No, but I work much more than that.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.460]   But there's no, every kind of lifestyle
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:00.820]   has its complexities.
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.020]   I think nine to five means you have to wake up
[01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:04.540]   at a certain time every day.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.540]   - Do people tell you to pull it back
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:07.940]   and they're like, hey, you're working too hard?
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:09.260]   - Yeah, a lot of people.
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.820]   What I want in my life, what I love in my life,
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.020]   especially people close to me
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:15.180]   are the ones that say work harder.
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:16.220]   'Cause everybody--
[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:17.300]   - How do you get them?
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:18.140]   - How do you get them?
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:19.780]   - I don't have anyone in my life that does that.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.740]   - Everybody's always worried about me.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.260]   - Yeah, everyone's worried about me.
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:25.180]   Everyone's always worried about me.
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:27.500]   The only thing, no one ever says,
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:30.220]   if I showed you my DMs right now, my texts,
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.420]   all it is is like, hey man, I'm worried about you.
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:35.060]   Like Joe, I love Joe to death.
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:37.700]   Not once has he, he always,
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.020]   I don't know if you've seen the caring Joe eyes
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:41.700]   where like, I'm worried about you.
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:42.540]   Where it's like,
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:46.900]   and you're like, hey man, don't do that.
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:48.420]   And he's like, I'm worried about you.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:49.940]   And you're like, don't fucking worry about me.
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:51.900]   I'm working, I'm just working.
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.300]   I love working, I love what I do.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.860]   I love what I do.
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.900]   I can only imagine that you love what you do
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:59.380]   as much as I love what I do.
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:00.700]   Because that's all I ever wanna think about.
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:01.740]   It's all I ever wanna talk about.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.340]   It's all I ever wanna be like,
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:08.740]   when my wife wants me to take August in,
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:11.300]   whatever the, August, whatever the fucking other month is.
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:13.140]   - September, that's coming after August.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.860]   - No, but like July and August off,
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:16.660]   after we do fully loaded.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.860]   And I was like, no.
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:20.700]   I was like, what do you mean?
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.180]   Like, so like, well, I'll just,
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:24.420]   am I gonna like sit in a chair and stuff?
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:25.940]   She's like, no, you can do, like take up a hobby.
[01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:28.100]   I go, writing jokes?
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:28.940]   Can I get on stage?
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:30.420]   Can I do sets in the city?
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:31.940]   'Cause I'm not gonna fucking,
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.020]   do you want me to like,
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:35.060]   like, I don't understand people who don't,
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.660]   I don't understand people who don't have the drive
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:38.500]   to work all the time.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.660]   I don't understand that.
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:40.500]   I envy it.
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:43.220]   I envy it 'cause I go, I would love to just be like,
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:44.660]   I'm gonna play video games.
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:46.700]   I can't play a video game.
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:48.780]   If I did, I'd be on Twitch trying to make money.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:51.340]   Like, I love, how do you find someone who goes,
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:52.580]   you need to work harder?
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.100]   - Yeah, especially when they see like,
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:56.380]   I don't know what you look like,
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:59.700]   but I look tormented when I'm working very hard.
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:04.460]   Like, it means, like, it's easy to worry for my wellbeing.
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:06.220]   It's not like I'm happy go lucky,
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:08.380]   but I'm happy underneath it.
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:11.820]   - My working too hard is like on a plane
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:14.220]   every other day or every day,
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:16.500]   getting up at six, working out,
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:19.500]   and then going until like two in the morning
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.380]   or one in the morning, and then going to sleep,
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:23.300]   and then getting up at six, working out,
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:25.860]   getting on a plane, going to another place.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.860]   Like, that's what my working,
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.900]   it's just a lot of travel in mind.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:29.780]   If I didn't drink on planes,
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:31.540]   I don't think anyone would probably worry about me at all.
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:32.740]   They'd be like, no, you're doing great.
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.100]   - But the working out is there.
[01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:36.300]   So I gotta ask you, 'cause you and I seem to have
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.180]   a similar relationship with running.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:40.740]   I like this idea of a slow treadmill.
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.180]   I like running slow.
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:46.780]   Like a 10 minute mile or something like this,
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:48.540]   I'll just run forever.
[01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:51.380]   Just listen to an audio book, listen to brown noise,
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.300]   think, I love it.
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:54.620]   - What's brown noise?
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:58.220]   - It's actually brownian noise, but short brown noise.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:00.020]   It's kind of like white noise, but deeper.
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:03.660]   So it's just noise like, shh, that.
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:04.500]   - Oh, wow.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.940]   - It kind of sounds like a waterfall.
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:08.180]   And I'll just listen to it and something happens to me.
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:10.340]   I think there's, you can ask Huberman about this,
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:12.460]   I don't know, but apparently there's some science
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:15.020]   that kind of focuses the mind and so on.
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.540]   - It's funny, 'cause I think sometimes
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:20.820]   what people don't get about running is they go,
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:23.180]   they get on and they put it on like a six right away
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:24.660]   on like a treadmill, and they go,
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:26.860]   I can't do this for fucking 30 minutes.
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:30.300]   But you can if you build yourself up to your six
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:32.420]   and you play games, I play games with myself a lot.
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:34.020]   Like I'll play games where I go,
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:37.380]   and I can do this, I can do this,
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:39.340]   I can do this almost, not all day long,
[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:41.100]   but I can do this a lot longer.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.340]   Like I did it for two hours the other day
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:45.100]   before my workout, or no, hour and a half
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:49.580]   before my workout, where I started at 3.5 walking,
[01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:53.460]   and then I get my jog up to like a five,
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.620]   and then I'm like 5.5, then I go six,
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:57.340]   and then I go, and once I'm at a six,
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:58.860]   my body's really loose.
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:00.940]   And so then I'll go, all right, bring it down to a 3.5.
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:03.860]   And then I go, punch it to a 7.5 for a quarter of a mile.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:07.580]   And then let's walk at a four, let's jog at a five.
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.540]   I can do that.
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:11.900]   I love, they're called fartlets, I think.
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:14.740]   And I love those, like where it's like,
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:18.640]   it's regimented running and sprinting at certain levels.
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:19.480]   I love that.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.180]   And I love also, when I work out,
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.540]   to listen to music, but put on
[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:26.540]   foreign language cooking shows on Netflix.
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:27.460]   - Can you explain that?
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:29.620]   - They just put it on mute, you don't need to hear it.
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.980]   For some reason, they're sexier,
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.780]   the way they're shot, they're sexier.
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:35.180]   And it's like, street food Asia,
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:37.340]   and they're just watching them make street food in Asia.
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:38.420]   There's one called broth.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:40.820]   It's called broth, the nation of broth.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:42.180]   And they're just making broths.
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:44.300]   And you're like, fuck, I want some broth.
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:46.260]   - So this is South America, this is Asia.
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.580]   - South America, Asia.
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:50.340]   They do one on pizzas.
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:53.580]   I've watched this one on pizzas, that I've watched it.
[01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:55.020]   There's like four episodes.
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:56.860]   I've watched every episode so many times
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:59.740]   that my trainer goes, God, that's that fucking,
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:00.980]   I could watch that again.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:05.780]   I love watching foreign language cooking shows on mute
[01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:06.620]   when I work out.
[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:07.700]   - While blasting music.
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:08.540]   - While blasting hip hop.
[01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:09.380]   - She's there.
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:13.380]   All right, well, I usually run outside,
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:14.220]   but I do this.
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:15.060]   - Oh, I can't.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:16.140]   I don't mind hiking.
[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:18.220]   And I like, I do, like, you know what my fun thing,
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:21.380]   the fun thing I would do, and this is ripped off
[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:24.500]   totally from Kam Haines, is I like to go,
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:28.020]   there's a great hike called Framing Canyon
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.140]   out in the valley where I live.
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:32.580]   And I'd be like, all right, I'm gonna run to Framing Canyon,
[01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:33.740]   I'm gonna jog to Framing Canyon,
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.020]   I'm gonna hike Framing Canyon,
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.420]   and then I'm gonna jog back.
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:39.460]   And then I go, I wonder how long that is.
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:41.220]   And I go, don't think about it.
[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:42.700]   Just know that that's your thing.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:44.340]   Just know that that's your thing.
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:45.300]   And then all of a sudden you're like, shit,
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:46.740]   that was eight miles?
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:48.420]   You're like, that's a fucking beast.
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:50.220]   The hike doesn't even feel like anything.
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:52.500]   The hike, once you do the jog, is the hard part there.
[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:56.340]   The jog home is a fucking cakewalk.
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:58.740]   I had the best jog when I was in Serbia.
[01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:01.300]   I had the best jog, I think it was in Hyde Park,
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.620]   I think the name of the park's Hyde Park.
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:07.420]   It was, get this, it was 80% downhill.
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.260]   - Wow.
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:10.620]   - So this jog, you start at the park,
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:12.460]   and it was like, and I'll do it like this for you.
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:15.260]   You went like, downhill like this,
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:18.380]   downhill like this, downhill like this,
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:20.820]   and then it was like a little steep incline
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.220]   to get to the beginning of it.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:25.780]   So it was like a little nice lower back pain,
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:28.980]   and you're like, okay, okay, and then the jog was perfect.
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:30.620]   And you did it four times, it was four miles.
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:31.460]   I loved it.
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:33.060]   And then the very first day I did it,
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:35.200]   a butterfly got in front of me,
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:36.820]   it's like six in the morning,
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:37.820]   yeah, six in the morning,
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:39.540]   and a butterfly got in front of me.
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:41.420]   And it ran the whole first mile in front of me,
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:43.180]   and I just, it was like so surreal.
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.940]   It would disappear, and then it would show back up
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:45.780]   in front of me.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:46.620]   - You sure it was real?
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.820]   - Yeah, definitely real.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:50.620]   And then the next day, and so I go, I'm on the right path.
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:51.780]   I'm on the right path.
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:53.900]   The next day I go for a jog, six in the morning,
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:58.020]   and it rained, and as I'm doing this steep uphill incline,
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:33:59.540]   a tree collapsed in front of me.
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:03.620]   Just went, and I went, whoa, a tree fell in the woods,
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:05.140]   and I was here to see it.
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:05.980]   Shut the fuck up.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:07.980]   I was like, that's crazy, and it didn't hit me.
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:09.340]   I'm on the right path.
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:10.780]   And then I started getting over thinking it.
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:11.860]   Like the next day I saw Condom,
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:13.700]   and I was like, this is a good place to go.
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:14.940]   I was like, people fucked here last night.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:17.540]   But yeah, that was one of the best jogs I've ever had.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:19.340]   I could do that, I could run that park every single day.
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:21.560]   No one jogged that park in Serbia.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:25.660]   - I actually recently had Condom on my doorstep,
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:29.660]   and I wanted to ask whoever is up there above
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:34.660]   what that means, what the story behind that is.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:36.900]   - Yeah.
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:39.800]   Just a pissed off UPS guy.
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:42.460]   Was it compromised?
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:43.460]   - What do you mean compromised?
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:44.900]   - Like was there stuff inside it?
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:45.740]   - Oh, I didn't look.
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:47.820]   - I mean, very few people put on the Condom
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:49.660]   and go, it's not for me, I'm gonna take it off.
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:50.500]   It's a little tight.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.420]   - Well, it could be to send a message,
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.860]   like a horse's head kind of thing.
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:54.700]   - Oh yeah.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.740]   I don't know what the message is exactly.
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:57.580]   - Do you use Condoms?
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:59.380]   If you had a one night stand, would you use a Condom?
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:00.700]   - I don't know what a Condom is.
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:01.540]   I never heard of it.
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:02.540]   - Good call.
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:03.380]   - I'm learning.
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:04.900]   - Good call.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:06.980]   - I've learned about sex from you today.
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.460]   - If my wife dies, there's no Condoms in my future.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:10.460]   I'll get it, I don't care.
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:12.220]   I have babies, I don't give a shit.
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:16.040]   - You're a man of principle, I like it.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.140]   Mark Maron wrote something about your book
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:21.700]   many, many, many ages ago, "Life of the Party".
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:23.760]   I think there's an interesting question in there.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.860]   So first of all, wrote eloquently about you.
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:31.860]   "Burke Kreischer is one of the great American wild men.
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:34.300]   "A gonzo warrior driven not by cynicism
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:35.940]   "or a desire to reveal a dark truth,
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:38.700]   "but instead by a deep, almost essential need
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.180]   "to have a good time, no matter what.
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:43.620]   "His stories track the trials and tribulations
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:46.240]   "of a big hearted dude trying to fit in,
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.560]   "help out and party and find himself.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.220]   "After all is said and done,
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:53.420]   "we arrive with him at the true humility of joy."
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:58.100]   So when was this desire for pure joy born in you?
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:03.100]   It seems like you are driven towards this joy.
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.660]   - Yeah.
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:08.660]   I think,
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:13.260]   I think I arrived at it in college.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.540]   I wasn't always the guy I am.
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:17.620]   I was really a pretty serious dude when I got to college.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.540]   - Like dark brooding serious?
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.620]   - Yeah, I wanted to be like Eddie Vedder.
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:24.420]   I wanted to be like a poet and a fucking lead singer.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.300]   And I wanted to be taken seriously
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.420]   and I wanted to be attractive.
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:29.280]   And I wanted to be, you know, like,
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.460]   I wanted to be wanted by chicks and respected by dudes.
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:39.220]   And, you know, and slowly but surely,
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:41.700]   I think the bird eye really am chipped away at that
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:43.980]   and was like, "Hey man."
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:45.220]   Like I would say funny,
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:47.180]   I would say funny things that would surprise me
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.260]   they were so funny.
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:49.940]   Meaning like in my fraternity,
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:53.500]   I'd say things that were the funniest thing that I go,
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.340]   "How did I think of that?"
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:56.740]   And then slowly I was like,
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:01.060]   and I remember as I chipped away at that
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:02.320]   and as I got older,
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:08.340]   I would lean towards that.
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:10.940]   We would go on a bus trip to like Clemson
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:14.460]   and I would get on the walkie talkie on the bus
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:16.560]   and I would do standup for like an hour.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.780]   I just make jokes for an hour.
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:22.500]   And I loved the impulse of like, you know,
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:23.500]   you get on the bus and everyone's like,
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:24.340]   "We're gonna drink."
[01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:25.180]   And you get that one group of girls
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:27.740]   that wasn't gonna drink and then to break them.
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:29.640]   And they're like, "Oh, fuck it, fine, let's drink."
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:33.140]   And then that, to watch that happen.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.220]   And I think then once I, and then when I went to Russia,
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:38.720]   this is so cliche for me to say,
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.900]   but interacting with those young banditi,
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:45.640]   they were pretty serious dudes.
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:48.760]   They didn't have like, they were pretty stoic dudes.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.580]   And when you could make them laugh,
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.020]   it was like a real, it was a real joy.
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.180]   The silliest things.
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:58.620]   I remember, you know, we were told there was a club,
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:01.940]   it's called, it was called Cafe Europa
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:03.780]   or maybe Cafe Americana.
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:05.180]   There's where everyone really hung out.
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:07.260]   Like all the real dudes, the real dudes
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:10.700]   in St. Petersburg.
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:12.860]   And they had told us that like,
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:16.100]   they told us in our class that Russian women
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:17.780]   didn't have tampons.
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.880]   So they were like, "Bring tampons
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:24.000]   to give to the babushka, the dvuchka that ran the floor."
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.440]   - After all this time,
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.960]   the fact that you're Russian sucks is awesome.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:28.800]   - Yeah, it's--
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.120]   - 'Cause you keep mispronouncing words horribly.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.280]   - Horribly, I'm so fucking bad.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.520]   I am so bad.
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:37.000]   You know, that's how I got the name of the machine, right?
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:37.840]   - Yeah.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:38.660]   - I was trying to say I'm a man.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:39.500]   - Yeah.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:40.320]   - And I said I'm a car.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.160]   - Yeah.
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:42.760]   - And they just were like, "Huh?"
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:45.320]   And so I came into the room one night
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:47.680]   with a top pocket full of tampons.
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:48.520]   - Yeah.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.800]   - And they were like, "What are those for?"
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:51.760]   I said, "Girls, we're gonna pick up girls."
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:55.160]   And the look on their face was so,
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:56.940]   it was so pure joy.
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:58.720]   I remember the first night I pulled out lemons.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:02.200]   And this is, it sounds make-believe now to say it
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:03.040]   'cause it's been in the movie.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.520]   And I brought out lemons, we were in lemon drops.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.760]   I had vodka and lemons and sugar and a pocket knife
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.200]   and a fanny pack.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.240]   And I put out lemons and this guy Igor goes,
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.720]   "Oh, the machine runs on lemons?"
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.800]   Like it was just so foreign
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.480]   that you would need lemon for them.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.320]   - Yeah.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.600]   - And so I think, and I made friends with those guys.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.760]   Like friends, whatever you can.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.440]   But definitely me and that guy Igor were legit friends.
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.280]   Legit friends.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.840]   - But from a place of joy, like rejoicing in life.
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:32.760]   - It was like real.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:33.840]   - Seeing them light up.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:36.560]   - And then I remember backpacking through Europe after that
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:40.120]   and realizing I could bring a spark of fun
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:41.680]   to like a campfire.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:42.760]   And I had little tricks.
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.320]   I learned all the currencies around the world.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.240]   And so I'd challenge people to a currency game.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.160]   I go, let's go head to head.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:52.640]   You say, you name a country in the currency
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.600]   and I'll name a country in the currency.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:56.240]   And I would slow roll them.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.080]   I just do all the dollars, right?
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.440]   The Chinese dollar, the American dollar,
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:00.280]   the Australian dollar.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.120]   I'd run through all the dollars
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:02.720]   and they'd be like, "You only know the dollars."
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.360]   And then I'd start getting really deep.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.840]   I could make an event out of a night.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.520]   In Europe, I could make an event.
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:13.480]   I remember we were in Strasbourg
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:15.560]   and the bar was supposed to close,
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.280]   but I had friends coming to the bar.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:20.880]   The train hadn't gotten in yet.
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.320]   And I said, "Don't close the bar.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.760]   "I'll stand on the bar
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:27.280]   "and I'll entertain everyone in this room.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:28.600]   "I'll dance, I'll do whatever
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:30.200]   "if you just keep the bar open."
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.600]   And the guy goes, "If you can keep me laughing,
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.080]   "I'll keep the bar open."
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:39.080]   And I danced and made this guy laugh on a bar
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:43.720]   for legit, I'm not even, like legit 30 minutes
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.180]   until my friends walked in and they're like,
[01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:47.080]   "What the fuck's going on?"
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:51.840]   I had this ability to, without humility,
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.440]   I didn't mind looking like a fool
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:56.680]   and doing, and they were really stupid jokes at the time,
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:00.420]   just very base American frat boy jokes.
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:01.880]   But I had a spark and when I came back,
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:05.240]   I feel like I learned how to do that
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.720]   and do funny things that were fun.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.240]   We'd go to a football game
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:11.560]   and I brought a camera around with me a lot.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.420]   I like to take pictures.
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:15.680]   And I remember one of the jokes I'd go is,
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:16.960]   I'd go, "Hey, everybody,
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.500]   "I told my parents I have a lot of friends.
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:20.840]   "Can you guys gather around and we'll take a picture?"
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:24.200]   And so, 50 people would lean around like, "Hey!"
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.280]   And just the dumbest, silliest things.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.120]   And I wasn't a big self-promoter,
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.680]   so these would happen and I was just doing them
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.860]   for me and my friends.
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:38.480]   I'd bring a guitar out and I'd just make up songs.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:46.320]   So I think in watching this serious Bert
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:49.640]   get chipped away at until my six and a half year of college
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:52.200]   where it was just this silly guy
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.520]   and then Rolling Stones written about me
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:58.500]   and I'm like, and I remember a couple serious dads going,
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.020]   "Yo, you got a chance to turn this into something.
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:02.920]   "You need to go to, you need to follow your dream."
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.720]   And I tried to stand up the first night
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.440]   and I was like, maybe not wasn't the funniest guy,
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.880]   but man, they laughed and we had a good time
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.320]   for 30 minutes and it worked
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.360]   and it was stream of consciousness.
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.200]   And I was like, yeah.
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.820]   And then of course, that same little path you take
[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:18.720]   gets convoluted in New York
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:19.960]   'cause you wanna be a serious comic
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.440]   and you wanna be taken seriously
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:23.160]   and you wanna be edgy and you wanna say the,
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:24.720]   and then slowly but surely,
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.000]   the real Bert chips away at it
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.040]   and he's like, "Yo, man,
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.060]   "just fucking take your shirt off and kill a beer.
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:30.240]   "Like fucking tell the machine story.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.960]   "Tell a story about your stupid kids.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.080]   "Like just, you don't need to be
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:34.220]   "the fucking edgiest dude in the room.
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:36.060]   "Leave that to the good ones.
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:39.740]   "Let Bill and fucking Joe and Tom,
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:42.760]   "those are the legit fucking gangster comics.
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:45.160]   "I mean, those are the fucking,
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:48.340]   "you're never gonna out fucking Chappelle.
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.160]   "Those guys are fucking gangsters.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:52.580]   "Do what you do, have fun, make life fun
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.340]   "and seize the day and fucking try to bring a spark
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:58.160]   "to people and let them forget about their fucking day."
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.680]   - And the interesting thing about alcohol
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:03.560]   that I've, I don't really like drinking
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.040]   in terms of the actual physical,
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.380]   like how it makes me feel,
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.940]   but there's the camaraderie that happens.
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:12.180]   I wish there was another way to get there,
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:13.380]   but I don't think there is.
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:16.420]   That joy you get of just everybody getting together
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:18.340]   and taking shots or drinking,
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:19.620]   not the polite kind of drinking,
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:23.220]   but just everybody just the fuck it kind of drinking.
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:25.740]   - Yeah, and when someone goes, "All right, I'm in."
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:27.940]   Like that's the funnest.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:30.300]   And then especially when you have a big group
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:31.380]   and there's like a big group.
[01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:33.100]   And like we were at the premiere the other night
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.660]   and I was working, I was legit working.
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:40.420]   I'm trying to sell the movie to outlets, media outlets
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:42.500]   and busing with the boys.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:44.620]   My wife flew them in to surprise me
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:46.320]   and they're over on the red carpet
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.820]   and they're like, "Yo, let's scuttle beer,
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:49.120]   "let's kill a beer."
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.840]   And I was like, "Oh," and then I'm like,
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:53.660]   "Oh, fuck it, I don't give a, this is what life's about."
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.600]   And that moment where they're like,
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:57.700]   "Yeah, that's the funnest fucking."
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:59.340]   Especially when I can get Leanne to do it.
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:01.260]   When I get Leanne to get a drink
[01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:04.820]   and she's like, like I wasn't supposed to drink last night.
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:06.320]   And she was like, "You wanna just,
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.180]   "we should go have a glass of wine in the front yard."
[01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:10.960]   And you're like, "Oh, my heart skips a beat."
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:12.380]   I go, "Glass of wine in the front yard?
[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:13.420]   "Are we gonna talk wild?
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:15.040]   "Are we gonna say crazy shit to each other?
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:15.880]   "Like fuck yeah."
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:16.860]   - In the front yard.
[01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:17.700]   - Front yard, yeah.
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:18.540]   - What are you doing in the front yard?
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:19.820]   - Let the dogs play.
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.140]   Big trees in the front yard.
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:22.860]   - Why are you sitting on the, where were you sitting?
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:25.300]   - Sitting in the Adirondacks on the front porch,
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:26.480]   letting the dogs play,
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:28.320]   letting the dogs rest in the front yard.
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.920]   Maybe go over, pick some cherries,
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.340]   look at the fucking trees,
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:33.180]   hear the wind going through the front yard.
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:34.340]   And then you go to the backyard,
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:36.740]   that's where the cigar comes out, a little more privacy.
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:38.440]   But yeah, glass. - Red wine?
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.300]   - Red wine, I'm all back.
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:41.580]   Keep our sulfites low.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:45.100]   - Yeah, wine is a whole 'nother one too.
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:47.180]   I feel sophisticated.
[01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:48.300]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:51.340]   - I traveled, before Ukraine,
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:54.300]   I went to Paris for the first time and I drank wine there.
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:59.300]   And I felt like I was a sophisticated man.
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:00.820]   - Dude.
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:04.160]   - I didn't speak much French, but.
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.000]   - You don't need to.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:05.820]   - You don't need to.
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:09.360]   - Just start smoking too, just have a fucking cigarette.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:12.400]   - I was gonna start writing poetry, reading Hemingway.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:15.880]   - There's a glass of wine in Italy,
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:20.880]   and we went, oh, the most beautiful fucking day of my life.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:30.000]   Just outside Florence, they have all the vineyards and stuff
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.640]   and we took a Vespa tour.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.480]   - Nice.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:37.480]   - And it was fucking, and Isla's too young to ride,
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:39.000]   so she's on the back.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.540]   And now everyone can drink there, you know?
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:43.320]   You're not supposed to drink and drive Vespas,
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:46.200]   but they go, a glass of wine is nothing.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:49.200]   And you're like, okay, I guess I'll have a couple then.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:51.520]   If you think one's nothing, then I think two's nothing also.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:53.200]   - So this is drunk Bert on a Vespa?
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:58.220]   - Not even drunk, but just lightly feathered.
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:01.320]   And it's beautiful.
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:03.320]   My wife hasn't been drinking.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:06.360]   Georgia's too young, Isla is too young.
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:08.960]   But at dinner we had a couple,
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:12.200]   and we're going through these hills and it starts raining.
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.240]   And it starts raining.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.920]   And I go, Isla, what are we missing?
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.800]   And she goes, music, big boy.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.920]   And I go, what do you wanna hear?
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:21.640]   And then she just starts going,
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:25.720]   ooga, shocka, ooga, ooga, ooga, shocka, ooga, ooga.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:28.520]   I can't stop this feeling.
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:30.160]   She's screaming it behind.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:32.360]   And then I hear Georgia screaming it.
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.480]   And then Leanne singing it.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.000]   And then Sandy and her two daughters are singing it.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.720]   We're all on these Vespas and we're all singing it.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:43.320]   And I swear to God, if I hadn't been lightly feathered,
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.520]   I don't know if I would have been like,
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:45.520]   Isla, what are we missing?
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.520]   'Cause you know, alcohol will give you that thing
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:49.440]   like what's next, what's bigger?
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:51.200]   How do we take this to the next level?
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.920]   And then I got this little girl
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:55.080]   who's still my little girl at that moment
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.400]   when she's singing, sing it.
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:59.440]   All the good times,
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:01.280]   even up so high.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:02.960]   Even up girl.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:04.080]   And then we stop at the light
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.440]   and all of us are looking and it's pouring rain.
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:09.280]   Ah, ooh, ooh.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:11.120]   Don't do the feeling, don't.
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:14.800]   It is, I mean, I remember sobbing, crying,
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:17.080]   sobbing, crying, sobbing, crying.
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:19.280]   And then I was like, let's get these fucking Vespas up
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.680]   and get to a vineyard.
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:22.320]   And then we went to a vineyard
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.960]   and all the girls tried a little wine,
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:25.520]   no one got buzzed or anything,
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:28.280]   but you're just sitting there with your family going like,
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:30.400]   fuck dude.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:33.040]   And I'm not certain you get that without a little bit of.
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.760]   A little bit, but then a lot is also interesting.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:39.280]   I had a lot of whiskey with Rogan once.
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:40.160]   I think I saw that.
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.360]   I think I saw that with Whitney too.
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:43.200]   You with Whitney.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.240]   In the pushup concert contest.
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:45.440]   With David Goggins.
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.920]   The only time I met David Goggins in person,
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:50.200]   one of the great embarrassments of my life
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.440]   is trashed out of my mind.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.480]   I'm trying to say how much of a fan I am.
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.120]   And I could tell by the look in his eye
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.800]   that what is actually coming out of my mouth is not good.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:01.640]   It's not good.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.480]   And his wife is embarrassed standing right there also.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:06.740]   Just everybody's embarrassed for me.
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:08.000]   Man, I'm trying my best.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.760]   And then somehow I find myself a minute later
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:13.480]   doing pushups with him as a challenge.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.040]   I didn't, it wasn't counting.
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:16.560]   All I knew, I'm not stopping.
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:20.200]   And he was polite enough to stop.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:22.600]   I think probably like 50, I don't know.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:25.280]   There's a gift someone gives you when they get drunk
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:28.080]   and they allow, they get drunk and they lower their guard
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:29.720]   and they allow you to see them that way.
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:30.540]   It's a gift.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:31.600]   It's a real gift.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.600]   It's just as cool as like pulling someone aside
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:36.040]   and going, yo, I'm into anime.
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:37.080]   Like, are you cool with that?
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.480]   And then they're going, yeah, I'm, oh, yeah.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:40.920]   Can I show you some cool anime?
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:42.320]   And then you're like, that's not my thing.
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.640]   But it's like a cool thing.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:45.280]   It's like sharing cool music with someone
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.360]   or like telling them something about your childhood.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.120]   When you get drunk, like real drunk around someone,
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:52.560]   you're giving them a gift.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.680]   And that gift is, I want you to see me for everything I am.
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:57.480]   You're not gonna get any lies.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:59.080]   You're not gonna get any bullshit.
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:01.200]   This is me at my absolute worst.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:02.280]   I have a rule.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:05.240]   I will never, never get mad at someone
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:07.200]   for getting too fucked up.
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:08.600]   'Cause they're giving you a gift.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.360]   They're saying like, yo, I did this on accident,
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.540]   but I trust you enough to let you know
[01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:16.560]   that this is who I am and this is what you're getting.
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:17.400]   I love it.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:18.220]   I love it.
[01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:20.200]   Especially when it comes from someone you don't expect.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:22.800]   Like you, shut the fuck up.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.800]   David Goggins should have hugged you and said,
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.240]   thanks for showing me this.
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:29.440]   - Yeah, I guess that really, you're right.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:30.640]   I haven't thought of it that way.
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:32.400]   There's an intimacy to that.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.320]   That is a gift of like fragility.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.680]   Like this is me.
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.600]   I mean, I'm a very loving drunk,
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:40.080]   but boy, am I a dumb drunk.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:40.920]   I'm just dumb.
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.600]   - I bet you haven't seen "Dumb Drunk."
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:46.760]   - Well, dumb in terms of the eloquence of the words
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.440]   that are coming out of my mouth.
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:52.080]   So like, you're just not stitching words together correctly
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:53.120]   to make sentences.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:53.960]   - No.
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:57.000]   - I turn into Hemingway lost in translation.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.600]   Like I'll start saying random words,
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.800]   but like translated to Japanese and back to English.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.760]   It's not making any sense, but there's love.
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.760]   Like I think what you feel is this kind of desire
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.560]   to connect that I think I always feel towards other people.
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.520]   But when I'm drunk, I'm just say, fuck it.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:14.920]   I don't need to be polite.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:17.160]   I'll just be loving fully.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:18.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.320]   It's cool when people let you see that in them.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:25.200]   'Cause some people are really like measured.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:26.440]   Like no one drink and then I'm done.
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.000]   I don't want it, no, no, no, no.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.160]   And you're like, oh, show me a little more.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:31.520]   And then like, it's cool.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:33.360]   And I never like, and I love,
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:34.800]   my favorite moments in the next morning
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.960]   when they're like, did I make an ass out of myself?
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:38.960]   And you get to say, not at all.
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:39.800]   - Yeah.
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:40.640]   - Not at all.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.460]   That's the coolest thing.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:45.420]   - And some people, bad people will leverage that over you.
[01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:46.660]   You can see it's a bully tactic.
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:47.500]   They'll leverage that.
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:51.020]   The bad interactions I've had in this business
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:52.940]   that we were talking about earlier,
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:56.660]   they were people that when you got fucked up,
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:58.180]   they used it against you.
[01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:00.060]   They held it over your head and they said,
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:02.660]   listen, man, I don't know what the fuck,
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:05.500]   but if you want, and you're like, hold on.
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:08.420]   And then they made you, they gaslight you
[01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:10.980]   into thinking you were the only one that was fucked up.
[01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:13.940]   And you're like, okay, I guess I know who you are now.
[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:16.820]   And I was like, didn't you get fucked up a little bit too?
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:18.620]   Like, I know we smoked weed and I thought we ate Xanax,
[01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:21.020]   but like, what about the, I know I had a couple beers,
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:23.140]   but like, I wasn't that fucked up.
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.380]   - Well, Whitney's really good at that
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:26.860]   'cause she's the person, I woke up next morning
[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:30.380]   and she said, yeah, you were wonderful.
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:32.140]   You were eloquent, you were great.
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:34.780]   I'm sure she was making that up completely.
[01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:36.120]   - It was funny, I got blackout drunk
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:38.100]   at Whitney's roast of me, like blackout drunk.
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:39.700]   Don't remember any of it.
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:40.780]   And don't remember any of it.
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:43.020]   I don't remember speaking on the microphone.
[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:45.460]   I don't remember talking in the microphone.
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:47.900]   And I did the set apparently.
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:48.820]   - Yeah.
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:50.340]   - And I said to Whitney,
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:51.900]   like in a real moment of vulnerability,
[01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:54.860]   Whitney's like a sister to me, like a legit sister.
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:56.500]   My daughters call her Aunt Whitney,
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.980]   Leanne's like a sister to Leanne.
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:00.340]   If she comes over to do a podcast,
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:01.860]   Whitney will show up an hour early
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:04.020]   and sit with Leanne out in Leanne's rose garden
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:05.060]   and just talk.
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:10.300]   And Whitney, I said the next day, I called Whitney
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:14.100]   and I was getting on a plane and I knew I was hungover.
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:15.500]   I said, how bad was I last night?
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.980]   She goes, you were fucking fantastic.
[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:19.340]   And just didn't let me sit with it.
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:20.380]   And then I watched the video and I was like,
[01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:21.860]   oh, I was fucking out of control.
[01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:22.700]   I was way out of control.
[01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:23.900]   Thank you for lying to me.
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:26.880]   - Yeah, so while being a wild out there comic,
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.500]   she's also this like caring and loving human being.
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:30.340]   So interesting.
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:35.100]   - She is the most nurturing sensibility.
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:39.380]   She sends my daughters gifts out of nowhere,
[01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:42.300]   just out of nowhere, just send Georgia gifts up at college.
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:43.380]   It's just a gift box.
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:45.620]   Like she is just, she takes care of people.
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.780]   - That's her love language.
[01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:48.460]   And she's also the person that taught me
[01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:51.260]   what the hell love language even means.
[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:53.540]   Apparently there's a book and there's like five of them.
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:56.340]   - You and Whitney, I would love to sit in a fucking room
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:57.540]   and watch you two talk.
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:00.860]   - Yeah, she has a robot that looks like her.
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:04.460]   And that's the future, that robot.
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:07.460]   - I told her she should have that robot do porn.
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.620]   Let someone fuck that robot.
[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:12.940]   And then, and she can deep fake the face if she wants,
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:16.200]   but I go, promote a special that way.
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:21.220]   - Like a full on, not like Showtime, softcore porn,
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:22.820]   like full on porn porn.
[01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:24.940]   - Full on like the dude like,
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:27.900]   she's like, hi, welcome inside.
[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:30.780]   You look tired, do you need a drink?
[01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:33.300]   Oops, I'm stuck in the dryer.
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:34.980]   - What's the promotion you're most proud of
[01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:35.820]   that you've done?
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.020]   - Without a doubt, it's gotta be when I took dance lessons.
[01:53:40.020 --> 01:53:40.980]   - Yeah, that was epic.
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:43.660]   - Because I tried to get Joe and Tom and Ari
[01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:45.140]   to do it for Sober October.
[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:46.300]   - I was rooting for you.
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:48.300]   - And they said no, so I was like, absolutely not.
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:49.740]   - You knew Joe was gonna say no.
[01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:52.900]   - But Joe's a legit dancer, like he can legit dance.
[01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:54.900]   He took like dance lessons for a movie
[01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:57.060]   and is apparently an amazing dancer.
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:58.020]   And so--
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:00.660]   - You're right, he could have said yes.
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:02.380]   He could have said yes, 'cause I remember listening
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:04.420]   to that podcast where you really made the pitch.
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:06.900]   - Yeah, and I said, we all take hip hop dance lessons.
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:08.900]   Your cardio's through the roof.
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:10.820]   And you do an hour dance lesson,
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.060]   then we all do a hip hop dance,
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:14.660]   and then we all put our hip hop dances against each other
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.580]   and we see who has the best hip hop dance.
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:19.100]   It's different than the typical stuff we do.
[01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:20.700]   It's fun, and we can also work out,
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:23.260]   we can do everything, but let's do hip hop dance.
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:26.100]   And Joe adamantly was like, that's a horrible idea,
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:27.460]   I will not do that.
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:29.980]   And then Tom and Ari just whatever,
[01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:31.580]   they were like, yeah, I side with Joe,
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:33.020]   we'll do something else.
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:36.100]   And then I was like, but I knew I liked hip hop dance.
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:37.740]   And so I was like, I'm gonna take hip hop dance lessons
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:39.980]   anyway, I'm gonna just do it over Sober October,
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:41.740]   and I'm just gonna fucking do it.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:44.860]   And then maybe I'll do a hip hop dance video,
[01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:47.540]   and then show it to them and let them rate me.
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:52.540]   And then we did it, and it was $1,200 for hip hop dance
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:55.900]   lessons for a month or whatever, for a couple weeks.
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:55:00.180]   And then when we did it, I thought, you know what,
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:02.460]   I bet we could put tour dates next to this.
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:06.080]   'Cause it turned out being kinda good, but kinda funny.
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:08.160]   But we could put tour dates next to this.
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:11.600]   And it was the beginning of me figuring out the whole,
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:13.240]   my promos were short and quick,
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:14.800]   and they were always like something silly.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:17.560]   What's up guys, it's your boy, Bert Kreischer.
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.480]   And then that one blew up, and immediately,
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:22.440]   I was announcing the tour, and immediately,
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:23.960]   every tour date sold out.
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:26.580]   And then every, we added shows that day,
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:29.360]   we added shows, and every one of those sold out.
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.280]   And I was like, whoa.
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:33.000]   And then Tom was like, the fuck was that?
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.360]   And I was like, I think I just sold out
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:38.280]   my whole fucking tour.
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:43.280]   And then when Tom did his one like that,
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:45.000]   and put his tour dates on it.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.400]   - Yeah, went over the top.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.920]   - He sold out his tours.
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:49.320]   And he was like, whoa.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:50.920]   He's like, dude, I sold out every fucking show.
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:53.600]   We've added shows, I'm doing an arena here.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:54.880]   And this is before we were doing arenas.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:56.240]   I was like, shut the fuck up.
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:58.320]   And that changed my game where I was like,
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.920]   all right, so everything's gotta be,
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:03.140]   and then I was like, I don't mind spending a little money.
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:06.080]   And then the next one I did was the marching band.
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.460]   And I was just like, but it was real crazy.
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:11.560]   I just said, can you guys get me a marching band?
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:13.640]   And they were like, yeah, it's like 2,400 bucks.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:14.700]   I go, cool.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:15.540]   And they're like, what do you want them to do?
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:17.320]   And I go, I don't know, we'll figure it out.
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:19.820]   And they came over, and they had outfits,
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:21.920]   and they were like, so what do you want us to play?
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:23.680]   I go, what song do you guys know?
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:25.080]   And then they didn't even know each other.
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:26.720]   They were all hired people.
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:28.600]   And they were like, Rubber Band Man?
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:30.640]   And I was like, oh, sure, yeah.
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:31.840]   And then we just scripted it out.
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:34.080]   I was like, all right, I'll pretend it's a regular thing,
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.400]   lifting weights, I'll walk out, and then I'll blow a whistle.
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:39.800]   And then you come out with the (imitates drumming)
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:42.680]   And then we got like two videos out of that,
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:45.180]   and that sold out dates, and I was like, fuck.
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:52.580]   And then the real baller one, the fucking real one,
[01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:58.640]   the real one was I tore all the muscles in my arm
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:01.000]   going into shooting the movie,
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.600]   and I ripped all the tricep muscles off,
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.720]   and they were retracted, so I had to go in for surgery.
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:10.480]   And the anesthesiologist said to me the night before,
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.520]   he's like, what music do you want going under?
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:13.360]   And I was like, what?
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:15.200]   And he goes, you can pick your music going under.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:17.520]   I said, wait, hold on, is it like,
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:18.800]   I go, is it like casual?
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:20.240]   And he was like, yeah.
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:22.720]   I said, I'm doing a promo read going under.
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:23.560]   He goes, what do you mean?
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:25.160]   I said, I'll explain it to you tomorrow,
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:27.040]   but I'm not gonna count backwards.
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.760]   I'm just gonna do a promo read until I pass out,
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:31.760]   and my phone's gonna fall on the ground.
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:35.640]   All I need you to do is hit stop record.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:38.160]   And so they rolled me into surgery.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:39.000]   I had Red Rocks.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.580]   I'd only sold like 75% of Red Rocks,
[01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:42.720]   which is the biggest, 10,000,
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:45.300]   the biggest venue I'd ever played in.
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:47.520]   And I rolled in with my thing,
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:49.800]   with CCR playing in the background,
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:52.360]   and I just was like, as I lay here on this mat,
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:56.000]   or on this steel, I was terrified as I go into surgery,
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.640]   I want you to know one thing.
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:59.800]   I'm playing Red Rocks September 10th.
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:01.520]   And then I started doing my promo read,
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:02.480]   and he was like, yeah, I go,
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.920]   Jimmy Buffett's there the night before
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:04.760]   and the night after.
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:05.580]   He's like, for real?
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:06.420]   I go, yeah, you wanna come?
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:07.260]   He's like, hell yeah.
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:08.080]   He's like, all right.
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:08.920]   He's like, you're going under.
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:09.960]   And he hits it.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:10.800]   I go, oh, sure.
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:14.040]   And I dropped the phone, woke up out of surgery,
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:16.240]   and the first thing I said is, where's my phone?
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:17.400]   And he goes, you got it.
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:19.040]   And Leann's like, I've already watched it, it's good.
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:20.240]   And I went, for real?
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:24.920]   And so that was a big one.
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:26.000]   That was a big one too.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:26.880]   - Yeah, that was genius.
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:28.280]   But that was sort of opportunity,
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.560]   kind of jumping at an idea.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.560]   Have you ever met Mr. Beast, Jimmy?
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:32.800]   - No.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:35.840]   - So I got to hang out with him for a day,
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:38.480]   listen to him brainstorm with the team ideas.
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:39.460]   He kind of sounds like you,
[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:41.940]   but on steroids in terms of like,
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:45.040]   first of all, willing to spend any amount of money
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:46.720]   on an idea.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:49.740]   Like anything, anything is allowed.
[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:50.580]   Anything is allowed.
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:52.280]   - I love that energy.
[01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:55.880]   - The only thing is no like rated R stuff.
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:58.800]   So he's really trying to go like,
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:00.740]   for the broader audience, for kids and so on.
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:02.020]   So that's the limitation.
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:04.160]   So you can't do, like most of the ideas
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:05.960]   that pop into my head when anything's allowed
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:08.240]   is kind of dark.
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:10.800]   But the point is to really aggressively brainstorm
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:13.040]   every single day at the whiteboard.
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:16.720]   Like what, and he does that for YouTube shorts too,
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:18.120]   for one minute videos.
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:18.960]   - Really?
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:20.360]   - And just like, really,
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:22.600]   like what is the coolest thing we could possibly do?
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:23.440]   - I love that.
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:24.680]   I love that energy.
[01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:28.040]   - And that energy, most people don't do that.
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:29.280]   And they should.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:30.400]   Basically YouTubers do that
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:33.000]   'cause they're obsessed about this particular YouTube algorithm
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:33.840]   and so on.
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:35.720]   And Jimmy is the best at that.
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:38.520]   But like that can benefit you if you're a scientist,
[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:41.000]   if you're a comedian, if you're whatever.
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.080]   Just go all out.
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:45.280]   - There's something really authentically fun
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:48.780]   about just coming up with a really stupid idea
[01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:50.120]   and just going, let's see what happens.
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:51.280]   Who gives a fuck?
[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:52.660]   We've had those like,
[01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:55.320]   I thought I could catch an arrow one time
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:59.760]   and my wife's like, absolutely fucking not.
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:01.120]   And I go, I really think I can.
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:03.960]   I go, let's just get really close, shoot it,
[02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:05.240]   and then I'll see if I can catch it.
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:07.920]   And she's like, no, that's not what you're doing.
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:09.200]   And then my cousin's like,
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:10.520]   hey, we could cheat it to make you look like
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:11.360]   you caught an arrow.
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:12.500]   And I went, what?
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.280]   He was like, okay, let's do it like this.
[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:15.480]   And so we did it.
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:16.880]   They got sold a ton of tickets.
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:17.960]   It looks like I really caught it.
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:19.440]   Everyone knows I didn't catch an arrow.
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:21.560]   I mean, for the movie, we did a promo.
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.760]   Legendary was like, you do all the promos.
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:26.400]   And we did a promo and I thought I could slide out of my car
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:31.400]   like Tom Cruise did in a helicopter and with roller skates
[02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:34.600]   and get behind the car and then skate behind the car.
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:36.800]   And we just ran over my foot.
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:39.480]   And it was real and it was scary,
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:41.240]   but we just caught it all.
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:45.280]   And in doing it, my cousin's like, give me the read.
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.680]   And I'm like, duh, my movie comes out Memorial Day weekend.
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:49.840]   I think we have to go to the hospital.
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:51.640]   And then we went to the hospital and I'm in the Speedo
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:54.200]   with a helmet on, one broken roller skate.
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.520]   And then that did really well.
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:58.360]   And so like, I said, the whole thing
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:00:59.480]   is just turn the camera on.
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:01.760]   You never know what's gonna fucking happen.
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:03.560]   - And don't be afraid to look stupid
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:04.400]   and all that kind of stuff.
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:05.220]   Just go all out.
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:07.920]   - Fucking ego's the death of comedy.
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:10.120]   Like when you really give a, like,
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:13.600]   it's hard to be the coolest guy in the room
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:15.780]   and still wanna be a comedian.
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:17.360]   It's just let yourself be whoever you are.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:19.560]   And you'll see the great ones, they're like that.
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:23.920]   They don't, they're just regular fucking dudes.
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:25.040]   And you get some real slick ones.
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:26.880]   Like Dave's probably might be the coolest guy
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:27.720]   in the fucking room.
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:29.040]   He really might be.
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:31.480]   But I think that's just who the fuck he is.
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:34.280]   - Who are the, outside your close friend group,
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:36.960]   who are the greats to you, top five?
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:39.240]   - Outside of my friend group?
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:44.240]   - So like for me, probably Norm MacDonald, Mitch Heidberg,
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:47.920]   George Carlin, Tom Segura, number one.
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:48.760]   - Oh yeah?
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:49.580]   - No.
[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:50.420]   (laughing)
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:51.800]   I just wanted to say that.
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.200]   - That's an interesting pairing.
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:54.240]   (laughing)
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.800]   No, Mitch Heidberg, Dave Attell.
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:57.640]   - Dave Attell.
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:01:58.480]   - Dave Attell.
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:00.600]   - Everybody deeply respects Dave Attell.
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:01.840]   More than even his comedy.
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.720]   I love the show where he was--
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:04.560]   - Insomniac.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:05.720]   - Insomniac.
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:09.280]   He's so good at just the natural comedy
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.520]   of human interaction.
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:11.960]   - He's a brilliant comic.
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:14.200]   He's just a brilliant fucking mind.
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:17.880]   Norm MacDonald's a fucking genius, an absolute genius.
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:21.560]   I mean, look, Chappelle and Bill Burr
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.560]   are the two best in our generation, in my opinion.
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:28.400]   And that's understanding that I'm still friends
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:29.980]   with some of the best in our generation,
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:31.880]   but just the way their brains work
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:34.520]   is really on the next level.
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:36.840]   Those are guys, Stan Hope is the same way,
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:38.340]   just fucking genius.
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:41.040]   Rogan, Segura, those are my friend group.
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:42.820]   That's my really close friend group.
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:44.720]   But those other guys I'm friends with,
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:48.360]   but they're not like, that's like, yeah.
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:49.200]   - Louis C.K.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:51.440]   - Oh, Louis C.K., fuck, he's amazing.
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:55.160]   It's hard to do because you start forgetting people
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:56.640]   and then it's almost like people go,
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:57.640]   oh, so you didn't like that person?
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:59.000]   You're like, no, I fucking love that person.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:03.640]   I mean, there's, for me, Robin Williams,
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:04.800]   which is a whole 'nother thing.
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:09.800]   - Oh, yeah, Sarah Silverman, fucking, I love Janine.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:12.520]   I'm a fucking big Janine fan.
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:13.360]   I love her brain.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:14.740]   Maren's fucking hilarious.
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:17.680]   Patton's brilliant.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:19.600]   David Cross, I mean, there's like,
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:21.400]   it's really, to ignore those guys,
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:22.740]   and those guys were like the whole forefront
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:24.880]   of the alternative comedy front.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:26.760]   They're fucking amazing.
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:29.460]   - Yeah, and the people that have like Maren or Joe
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:31.000]   that have podcasts, it's interesting.
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:31.960]   It's an interesting pairing
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:33.880]   'cause you get to know everything about them,
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:35.600]   but then they're also comedians.
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.720]   And I've gotten, I've gone to Joe's club a lot.
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:42.280]   Listen, Joe and just that whole group of comics
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:45.640]   do comedy and go to the same set over and over and over
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:46.960]   and to see how it changes.
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:47.800]   It's really cool.
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:49.640]   - It's the coolest thing when I first started to watch,
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:51.240]   someone like Attell was really brilliant at it
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:53.080]   'cause you'd watch him tinker with a set.
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:53.920]   - Yeah.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:57.480]   - And he'd have an idea like hitting someone
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:59.400]   over the head with a hammer from behind,
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:02.160]   and then he'd work it nine different ways,
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:03.520]   you know, and you'd be like, whoa.
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:05.120]   So the hitting hammer in the head
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:07.680]   is the thing that he's working on.
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:10.520]   - I hope Eddie Murphy comes back.
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:11.640]   He's one of the greats.
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:14.080]   Chris Rock, Chris Rock's fucking,
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:16.560]   "Bring the Pain" is like the reason I got into comedy.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:17.400]   - Yeah.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.720]   Do you have advice for young folks?
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:24.840]   You seem like a stellar example of a successful human being,
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:30.200]   or more seriously, a very kind of nonlinear life.
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:31.360]   Do you have advice for young people
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:32.840]   in high school and college?
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:37.200]   How to have a good life they can be proud of?
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:41.440]   - Don't worry too much about what you do when you get older,
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:45.560]   but when you do start worrying,
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:48.840]   find the thing you love and it'll never feel like work.
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:53.360]   To fucking, I can't imagine what it must feel like
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:55.760]   to be a lawyer and have to read papers
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:57.760]   or whatever they do all day,
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:59.520]   and know that that's my day.
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:02.480]   I mean, it must feel like what school felt like for me.
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:06.080]   If you find that thing you love to do,
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:10.600]   you will work endlessly, effortlessly,
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:12.680]   and hard as fucking shit every day,
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:14.800]   and you'll love every day of your life.
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:16.680]   - "Find what you love and let it kill you,"
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:19.280]   Bukowski said that.
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:20.400]   - Then that's the fucking thing,
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:21.880]   'cause that's what I'm doing.
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:23.320]   I'm letting it fucking take,
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:28.320]   I'm on that fucking bullet train to fucking nowhere
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:29.920]   on this fucking comedy journey.
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:31.800]   I love it, I love it.
[02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:33.600]   - So it's like the Hunter S. Thompson thing,
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:35.440]   what is it, however you put it,
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:37.720]   basically you're not supposed to be,
[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:40.000]   end up in a well-preserved box,
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:44.160]   you slide in sideways, smoke, just beat up.
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:45.000]   - Yeah.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.040]   - Just a giant mess.
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:49.280]   - I love those guys that can really live that life
[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:51.680]   that are like, "Yeah, man, I'm breaking it,
[02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:53.520]   I'm breaking it down," like a guy like Tony Hawk
[02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:55.720]   or Matt Hoffman, who's like, "Yeah,
[02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:57.600]   if I don't fucking break the fuck out of this thing
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:59.920]   before I, then I'm not doing it right."
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:01.280]   - Then again, there's also Churchill,
[02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:03.200]   who tried to break the thing and he couldn't,
[02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:06.040]   lived into his 90s, a bad motherfucker.
[02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:08.040]   - Just a bad motherfucker.
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.840]   - So I guess the only hope we can have for Bert Kreischer
[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:13.320]   is that you're gonna be the Winston Churchill of comedy.
[02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:18.320]   - My life is lived perfectly if I'm 95 years old
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:20.720]   and all my friends are dead.
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:22.960]   (laughing)
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:24.640]   - Yeah.
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:27.920]   - And they're like, "Can you believe that wolf got Rogan?"
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:28.760]   - Yeah.
[02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:32.080]   - "Can you believe Segura, 600 pounds,
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:35.320]   and they had to carry him out in a crane out of that house?
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:39.200]   Can you believe that it's just Bert Kreischer
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:40.520]   and Joey Diaz left?"
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:42.280]   (laughing)
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:44.600]   - Just standing there in October,
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:47.840]   super October, just the two of you left, just laughing.
[02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:51.480]   - October is just, I'm 95 at the Mark Twain Awards
[02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:54.760]   and they're like, "Bert Kreischer's still fucking here.
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:57.200]   Who saw that coming?"
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:58.040]   - I hope so.
[02:06:58.040 --> 02:06:59.800]   Bert, I'm a huge fan of yours.
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:03.400]   It meant so much to me when you said that you knew who I was
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:04.480]   like we were talking about.
[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:06.840]   It just, it's so cool, it's so cool.
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:08.480]   Thank you for putting so much joy and love
[02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:09.520]   out there in the world.
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:12.360]   I'm a huge fan and thank you for the love you've given me.
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:13.200]   - Thank you, man.
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:14.440]   I am a huge fan of yours.
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.600]   You keep doing you, I'll keep doing me,
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:18.360]   and then let's see if we can meet in the middle sometime
[02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:19.880]   and have a cold beer in the afternoon.
[02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:20.720]   - Love you, brother.
[02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:22.080]   - Love you.
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:23.480]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:24.640]   with Bert Kreischer.
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:25.880]   To support this podcast,
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:28.440]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:30.160]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:32.040]   from Hunter S. Thompson.
[02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:34.760]   Life should not be a journey to the grave
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:37.000]   with the intention of arriving safely
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.280]   in a pretty and well-preserved body,
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:43.680]   but rather to skin in broadside in a cloud of smoke,
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:46.680]   thoroughly used up, totally worn out,
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:50.680]   and loudly proclaiming, "Wow, what a ride."
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:52.960]   Thank you for listening.
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:55.000]   I hope to see you next time.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.600]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:00.200]   (upbeat music)
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:10.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
