You forget everyone that like that I'm named the people that have betrayed me. I'm a larger man than all of them.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:03.640]   I'm a larger man than all of them.

And I woke up going, I gotta readjust my sleep score. That has to be a 97. That's the best fucking nap. Those little snooze naps are monsters. You know, there's, I don't care. That's probably for me, one of the peak experiences of life is those naps. I don't know what that is. Have you ever slept in a tour bus? A tour bus?

[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:19.920]   When you're in a bunk, it's ice cold. Bus isn't moving five o'clock.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.360]   Like we work out from like up until like five o'clock, five 30 show starts at
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:27.200]   seven, but that five o'clock to six, six 30 nap,
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.160]   .
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.240]   It's pitch black.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:54.680]   and you just listen to like Kurt Mombashi or like,
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.680]   Oh my God.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.800]   So you're talking about like five, 6:00 PM for 7:00 PM show. Oh,
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:05:59.800]   the best. Yeah. You'll ever have. You wake up. So refreshed. Yeah. Like, I've woken up from naps.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:05:59.800]   Like where I'm like, yeah. Like there are those, those tour bus naps are the best. Yeah.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:29.080]  , I think having a full productive day and then like five, 6:00 PM to a nap and then you do something really stressful after that. Like really hyper like, like a show, but if I do like I really like doing podcasts like late at night after a nap. I think I've fucked up my podcast rhythm because we're doing them in the day. And so sometimes I'm just like, like if I work out in the morning, I'm good on a podcast, but if I don't work out, I suck on a podcast. I'm just like, uh-huh.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.220]   Yeah.
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.520]   That's cool.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.520]   No, I, I, I'm my favorite is I used to do this a lot.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.520]   I haven't done it in a while is a full busy day nap at home,
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520]   box of wine on the treadmill and do that until like midnight.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.560]   I'm watching TV box of wine.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.560]   Box of wine on a treadmill.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.400]   It's the best.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.400]   How are you, wait, how are you sipping it?
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.240]   Jake?
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.400]   You have a glass, but you have a box, a box on the corner on the treadmill.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.240]   So you're gonna have to do it.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:48.920]   So you're gonna have to do it.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760]   So you're gonna have to do it.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.600]   So you're gonna have to do it.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.600]   So you're gonna have to do it.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:22.440]   I mean, you sit there and just put on like guys, grocery games or like just something.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.440]   It's like a.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.440]   You walk in or are you running?
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.440]   I walk.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:25.440]   I walk.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:25.440]   I walk like a three, five.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:25.440]   So what will happen is if you start at three, start at three, casual walk 20 minutes to get a mile in and then you and you're gonna feel loose.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:25.440]   Get up to a three, five.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:25.440]   You can do seven miles on these things and just and just and you're just enjoying your night. Especially like my wife back in the day when we lived in our old house, my wife would come in a demand and I would come in the man.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.480]   And she's sitting on the couch and we watched TV together.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.480]   And like watch Game of Thrones and you just like for an hour and you just get on the treadmill and do it.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.480]   Oh, man, I I loved having done that as much lately.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.480]   That was the fucking thing.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.480]   You can lose yourself.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480]   You can forget yourself.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:43.480]   You forget you're on a treadmill and you just start like walking and you're sweating and you're and you're having wine.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.480]   And then at a certain point, you're like.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:51.480]   Like you like you start jogging, especially like we were watching.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.480]   Not all quiet on the rest in front.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.480]   What's the one?
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.320]   What's the one?
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:25.360]   in.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:25.360]   I love to.

So I had to stay live on the tour bus in at a different house. And it was 4th of July. And I came in and they were doing an egg toss and they're like, well, you can do an egg toss. Then this is how bad my anxiety gets. You can do an egg toss with your daughter, Isla. So I, and I did an egg toss and we fucking got it to like legit, like 40 fucking feet where I was throwing overhand lobbing them to her.
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:39.240]   And the egg cracked in her hands and it broke over her face. And I got in bed that night, high on weed fucking drunk. And I went, what if I gave my daughter COVID from an egg toss? I go, that would be the most horrific way to kill a child. She got it from an egg toss. It broke in her face. Her dad did COVID. Yeah. I mean, that's the scariest thing about COVID I think is not you dying, but because of you somebody else dies.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:49.280]  ?
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.360]   hustle. I have at
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:57.320]  ob
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:09.360]   and I was like, "If you gave me fucking COVID." And then she never got COVID. She never got COVID. You mentioned IPAs. What's the way of the land of great beers?
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:39.400]   - I like Pilsner. I'm a Pilsner guy. I'm an ice cold beer guy. - Ice cold Pilsner. - I like an ice cold beer. I like an ice cold... One of the best beer buzzes I ever had is we had bought a new house but we weren't building it and over COVID I didn't drink for like three months, four months until we decided to go back out on tour and we figured that out and I was in the backyard and Leanne came back with like two tall boy German beers.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:39.400]   - Oh, my God. - Yeah.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:21:09.440]  obedient. And I was like, "Fuck yeah." And man, that second, that beer buzz is different than anything. The second it touches you, you feel the sparkle and you're just like, "Yeah, baby, I'm back." And then she's like, "You want another one?" I'm like, "Fuck yeah." And then we have another one. And then that beer buzz is especially an afternoon beer buzz. It's just so pretty. It's different than a night beer buzz. A night beer buzz is a night beer buzz.
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:39.480]   - Yeah.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   It's like, "Oh, I guess we'll have a beer and then I'll have a couple. I gotta go to work tomorrow. All right."
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   That afternoon irresponsible beer buzz.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   Pilsner. Pilsner. I don't mind an IPA, but it's got to be at somewhere. I gotta be at somewhere. I gotta be at somewhere. They gotta have an IPA like a local IPA. It's gotta be food involved and then I'm enjoying an IPA. I threw up an IPA in a bathtub in Salt Lake City one time.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   What do you mean? Oh, you threw up in the bathtub.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   What do you mean?
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   Oh, you threw up in the bathtub.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:22:09.520]   Oh, okay. No, no, no, no. I was drinking in a bathtub. Like bathtub with some water in it or? No, no, no, no, no. You're sitting in the bathtub. No, I'm getting ready to take a shower. I had a growler of IPA. It's about six in the morning. I have to fly that day to Vegas to jump off the stratosphere. All I need is a little bit of a buzz to get myself on this fucking plane. I have anxiety going through my fucking head because I'm the first person to jump off the stratosphere. And so I'm drinking an IPA out of a growler and a bathtub at six in the morning. And so I'm drinking an IPA out of a growler and a bathtub at six in the morning.
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:09.520]   And so I'm drinking an IPA out of a growler and a bathtub at six in the morning.
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:37.560]   And it just didn't sit right. And I threw it up and I was off IPAs for like 10 fucking years. I didn't have another IPA until I was like 46 because I was like all I could think about was throwing up that IPA in a bathtub in a shower and being like I'm going to throw up thinking about it. But yeah, I don't I didn't fuck with IPAs for a while and then during the pandemic I got it. I got back into IPAs. I was that way with Jack and Coke Jack Daniels and Coke. Really?
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:23:07.600]   and I was like, I'm going to throw up in a bathtub. And so I'm drinking an IPA out of a growler and a bathtub at six in the morning. And so I'm drinking an IPA out of a growler and a bathtub in a shower and being like I'm going to throw up thinking about it.

[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:46.260]  ,
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:35:03.420]  ,
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:06.180]   I was like "how did I think of that?" and I remember as I chipped away at that and as I got older I would
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.820]  . I am so bad. You know that's how I got the name of the machine right?
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:37.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:38.260]   I was trying to say I'm a man.
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:40.060]   And I said I'm a car.
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:40.580]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:41.900]   And they just were like "huh?"
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:47.580]   And so I came into the room one night with a top pocket full of tampons.
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:47.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:58.700]   And they were like "what are those for?" I said "girls. How are we gonna pick up girls?" And the look on their face was so, it was so pure joy. I remember the first night I pulled out lemons.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:03.260]   And this is, it sounds, it sounds make-believe now to say it because it's been in the movie and
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:33.360]   But I brought out lemons for lemon drops.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:33.360]   I had vodka and lemons and sugar and a pocket knife and a fanny pack. And I pull out lemons and this guy Igor goes "oh, the machine runs on lemons?" Like it was just so foreign that you would need lemon for them. And so I think, and I made friends with those guys, like friends, whatever you can, but like definitely me and that guy Igor were legit friends. Legit friends. Like.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:40:03.380]  , I mean, I think that was the first time I was in the movie.
