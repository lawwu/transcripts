[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760]   You know who drank?
[00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.620]   It's Churchill.
[00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.220]   That's my guy.
[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.860]   Yeah.
[00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.960]   You know that's my guy, right?
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.820]   So he did champagne.
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.780]   Well, you don't have to tell me a thing about Winston Churchill.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.980]   I found out about his daily routine.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:27.700]   So his daily routine was a big breakfast, cigar, coffee, eggs sunny side up, toast, bacon, sausage, tomato, beans, fruit, orange juice, soft scotch, cigar in bed, and he'd sit there for three hours.
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.820]   And then he'd get in the bathtub and drink champagne.
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960]   And then he'd go to lunch and have some goose with more champagne.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.300]   And then he'd take a nap.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.380]   And like, I love that.
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.020]   So every year on the day of his death, I think it's January 24th, I celebrate Winston Churchill's life by living the way he did.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.300]   And so I have breakfast in bed with a soft scotch, and I just party all day.
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.060]   That would be the guy to drink with.
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:58.780]   The following is a conversation with Bert Kreischer, a stand-up comedian, podcaster, actor, and a man they call The Machine.
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:16.920]   I've been a fan of his comedy and podcast for many years, and I highly recommend you watch him on Birdcast, Two Bears, One Cave with Tom Segura, his cooking show called Something's Burning, and finally, the new movie that tells the story of the man, the legend, the machine.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.880]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.840]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.780]   And now, dear friends, here's Bert Kreischer.
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.700]   I read somewhere.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.240]   I read somewhere that you like Ernest Hemingway.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.080]   Love him.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.940]   There's a quote, there's nothing to writing.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.260]   All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.620]   Do you agree with that?
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.400]   I agree.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.040]   I agree.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.580]   Well, I agree with that with journaling.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.100]   So I can't write stand-up.
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.440]   Like, I can't write a bit, but if I journal, I'll find something that I go just write.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.140]   I'm kind of writing where the pen's moving faster than your brain, and they're kind of like doing it together.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.480]   The thing I liked about Ernest Hemingway, this is so stupid.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.140]   I'm a little dyslexic, and so I'm not a good reader.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.700]   And so he wrote very simply.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.540]   And it wasn't until after I read a bunch of Ernest Hemingway, I was working at Barnes and Noble, and this person said, "Don't you love his titles?"
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.500]   And I was like, "Yeah, Sun Also Rises."
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.100]   And they're like, "Yeah, but the sun also rises."
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.400]   And I was like, "Yeah, Sun Also Rises."
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.760]   And they're like, "No, the sun also rises."
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.820]   And I went, "Oh, yeah, that is fucking badass.
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.480]   Yeah."
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.240]   And then I'm like, "Oh, yeah."
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.100]   I'm always late to the party with anything.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.980]   And then that night we were all doing coke, and it was like five in the morning, and we ended up on the roof of my apartment in Greenwich Village.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.780]   And I'm a sunset guy.
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.540]   I grew up in Florida.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.760]   But sunrises in New York are electric blue, like electric blue.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.420]   And I was like, "The sun also rises."
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.240]   Yeah, he was so good with just a handful of words.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.740]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.240]   The simplicity, the choice of words.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.240]   Basically, his process is carving down.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.240]   Write drunk, edit sober.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.240]   Write drunk, edit sober.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.240]   But he was good at a small amount of words to get a point across.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   I'm the exact fucking opposite.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   Well, he's also said the first draft of anything is always shit.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.240]   Is that true for you?
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.240]   I think so.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.240]   It's the best one I have.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.240]   Because Donald Trump is the best.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   I think so.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   I think so.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.240]   He goes downhill from there.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.240]   So for you, editing is destroying the original genius.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.240]   The first time I tell it, it's perfect.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.240]   It's perfect.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.240]   It works.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.240]   And then I go, "Great."
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.240]   And then I take it, and I try to fix it and make it better and jazzier.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   I just joke and razzle-dazzle about my daughters and I drive them past a deaf child sign.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.240]   And I just told it on stage.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.240]   It just happened.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.240]   And Louis was in the audience.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.240]   He goes, "I love that joke."
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   I said, "Really?"
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240]   He goes, "Yeah."
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.240]   And I just told it.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   And I went, "Done."
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   Louis C.K. says he likes the joke.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   It's fucking, it's in the special.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   And I tried to fucking razzle-dazzle that joke into like a 15-minute bit.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   It got to the point where it was so bad that I told him, I did a podcast with him.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   I said, "What did you like about that joke?"
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   Because I can't get it to work anymore.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   He goes, "It was just simple.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.240]   It was simple that your daughter didn't know how they'd figure out where deaf kids lived."
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.240]   I went, "That's it?"
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.240]   He's like, "Yeah."
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.240]   I was like, "Nothing about gun control?"
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.240]   And he was like, "Huh?"
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.240]   I was like, "Oh, fuck, man.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.240]   I really fucked that joke up."
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.240]   And then I had to go back to the beginning of it.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   But that first time, that's when the joke comes out purest for me.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.240]   And then it's always chasing back to get that first telling.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   Some jokes are different.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.240]   Like the machine, obviously, was a much longer story and like escape room for this one.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.240]   The longer stories take a little work.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.240]   But the simple ones, like the deaf child in pajamas and those first times are perfect.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240]   What do you think is the most important thing about the movie?
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.240]   What do you think is it about the machine story that works, that was so captivating for people?
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   I think it's a good story.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.240]   I think it's a good story.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   I think everyone has something similar that happened in their life where they had a crazy night and that no one believed.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   And they told their friends.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   Or they experienced that with a friend like that.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.240]   And I think that's got to be it.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   I really don't know.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:42.240]   I think there's a part of our community of comedy fans that were that early death squad that was fun to watch someone take something from the podcast and turn it into a bit on stage.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.240]   I think there was a lot of that.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:51.240]   But I think people identify with a wild, crazy night that got out of control that they've probably had too.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   I think.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.000]   think i don't know you think putin knows who you are because of that story i hope so
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.400]   i hope so i hope so but there's there's a part of me that that you got to understand is like
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.840]   i'm not i say stuff like that i'm sure there's someone who hears that and they go who is this
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.000]   narcissist you're like no that's not it i'm just telling the truth like i understand
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.800]   what i'm supposed to say well you know i don't know i do you know i i don't know that's hard
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.120]   to say but i don't give a about that guy i'm not that guy i'm telling you everything
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.360]   that comes out of my mouth the second it comes out i'm going to be 100 honest i don't know any
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.720]   other way to live i kind of hope so that would be cool and i look i know he's a bad i guess
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.520]   he's a bad dude i don't follow politics done but it'd be cool if like one day someone's like uh
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.600]   he's he's on his computer and somebody goes and he's like yeah yeah and he's like
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.840]   and it shows it to him and and then he's like
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.160]   this guy huh it's not out of the realm of possibility that uh putin has watched it
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   and this this podcast has kind of made me realize how like small the world is
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.480]   i've gotten to meet some incredibly oh yeah especially the people interesting people
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:10.560]   like that's i mean that's the thing where i go like it's gotten really crazy the internet's
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.720]   really insane and netflix is really insane and the reach of like people that like is really simple
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.760]   but like
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.680]   i'm a big fan of the show drink champs i didn't think in a million years nori would ever know who
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.840]   i was and then he offered me to come to his podcast and then when i got there he told me he

[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.520]   and so i have breakfast in bed with a soft scotch and i just party all day that would be the
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.200]   guy to drink with that would be the guy if you could pick anyone to drink with he drank every day
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.520]   throughout the day he lived like 94. and was
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:53.300]   one of the most heroic figures in human history never never surrender i mean what a badass thing

[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.400]   way i didn't do this research i just watched the crown okay and winston churchill kind of taught
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.920]   her about world politics and was that they like coming and she'd be like winston what did we do
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.000]   in africa and he's like this is gonna be a tough one and so yeah so but winston churchill's the
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.760]   badass but if i had to drink with someone living like drink and there's like there's a two obvious
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.560]   one like obviously it's kim jong-un right you kind of want to he drinks no way
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.580]   he does
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.180]   you think my ivs are good in the morning you know kim jong-un's ivs are next you're like i feel up
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:57.180]   and he's like it's amphetamine he would be a badass to drink i think he drinks hard liquor
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:03.380]   uh i think scotch johnny walker blue that's what i've heard i don't know where you heard this but
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:08.940]   i like this okay so i say things like that but then i'm sure i i i i don't know if you ever
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.700]   party with someone who just parties a little different than you and then you notice like
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.540]   like sometimes celebrity like as a celebrity you're like oh i'm gonna be a celebrity i'm gonna be a
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.600]   athletes and then like you're at a strip club and then they they talk weird to a woman you're like
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.000]   oh that's not me i'm so sorry so that would be the thing the atrocities would be hard to get
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.780]   with them not just the atrocity but the way of being i agree with you i actually don't like
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:33.680]   drinking with rich and powerful people often there's something weird about them yeah not not
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.720]   all of them and i don't like i don't like a drinking meeting like when someone goes
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:46.360]   like what's that people go like hey uh i'm taking you out tonight we're drinking yeah and then i go
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.840]   oh that's not the way i like to do it it gives me anxiety like um our lives are very different
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:58.960]   you and i yeah were you in a fraternity no we could start there yet no i was not okay
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:05.100]   that's the and the differences continue from there i'm sure so when you get your pledge of pen
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.420]   uh-huh they take you out and their whole thing is you're gonna we're getting you
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:08.700]   fucked up
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.560]   yeah that energy is not my energy i don't like that like it's i just go why don't we just get
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.520]   drunk and feel really good about ourselves like i never like took mushrooms to see jesus i just
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:26.040]   wanted to enjoy rain x on a windshield like so like that that for me uh is like one of my things
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.640]   so if if kim jong-un flew me to north korea to drink with him i'd be like i'd have to start
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.680]   really getting blackout drunk on the plane to enjoy drinking with him that day what's your
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.660]   favorite like different occasions what's
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:38.680]   your favorite
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:46.420]   drink what's your favorite way of drinking it's it's i've got it varies so what are the different
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:53.720]   contexts here it's like one-on-one one-on-one like you sit down with i don't know rogan invites
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.380]   you like it's a godfather to sit down and finally have a talk about something it's gonna be whiskey
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.260]   it's gonna be like a nice whiskey neat no i like it on the rocks and i like lots of rocks
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.660]   it won't be something expensive because rogan is not he's not a fancy boy you know
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:14.100]   like he's a real regular he's a really regular dude he's gotten less regular the more millions
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:19.260]   of dollars he has i think there's parts of him where you're like yeah like where you're like
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.600]   oh wow we can do this yeah um but he's a ray he'd be like jack on the rocks or like
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.980]   probably buffalo trace or one of the maybe a little whiskey he's buying rogan be uh whiskey
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:35.100]   rocks and then like that's a good i haven't hung out with joe by ourselves i take that back i was
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.540]   with him the other night but like it would be cool my times with joe's are always the same i'm not
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:38.540]   going to be with him the other night but like it would be cool my times with joe's are always the
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:38.540]   best i've ever had with him the other night but like it would be cool my times with joe's are always the
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:38.560]   best i've ever had with him the other night but like it would be cool my times with joe's are always
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:44.160]   on podcasts yeah and his i missed the times where it was where you just have you and him at the
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.480]   store late night yeah i'm okay with podcasts like i used to think this is like uh performative or
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.420]   something like this but it's not really no it's just a chance to really sit down i enjoy it
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:59.120]   because of the people i could never sit down with ah like david cross i would never sit down with
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.880]   david cross because we don't run in the same circles and but it's nice he has something to
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.420]   promote and then he comes to my house and then we can sit down for an hour and talk and then i
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:16.780]   and then or kevin smith like people i would never really hang out with tom um i enjoy being alone
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:25.300]   with tom more off mic yeah we have a lot of history there's a lot of things secrets we know
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.960]   about each other and there's a lot of secrets going on in each other's lives that i would
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:34.640]   never share on podcasts that i that i can talk to him about and i really appreciate his and i know
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.300]   this isn't on brand of us beating each other up but like i really appreciate his work and i really
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:45.060]   appreciate his insight as a as a dad and as a dude and as a son but but he makes me giggle harder
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.560]   than anyone so doing a podcast is fun so there's something on a podcast that's performative for you
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.080]   with him and then there's a part me and him because we're trying to make each other laugh
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:00.720]   but i'll tell you if we're going back to drinks i'll tell you like a great a great afternoon drink
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.900]   is a compari spritz it's my one of my favorite drinks in the world i don't even know what that
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.060]   is oh party spritz compari is an interesting
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:15.060]   alcohol because i think it's a bitter uh or it's a liqueur and it's got a weird rooty earthy taste
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.900]   it's red so it looks like kool-aid that's why i got into it i thought compari on ice would be oh
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:25.420]   so nice there's an old commercial but man it's fucking like sucking the green giant's dick it is
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:31.200]   earthy what's earthy it's like it's it tastes like roots it's oh nice it's not it's not it's
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:37.220]   there's a bitterness and like it's just not great and then someone introduced me to a negroni which
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.060]   is compari
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:44.500]   and gin and a little soda water and then compari spritz compari spritz is compari
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:54.360]   prosecco and soda water in like a wine glass and it is so enjoyable it's got so many different
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.800]   profiles to it where you get the bitterness but the sweetness of the prosecco and then it
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.440]   flattens it out with the soda water and it looks like kool-aid so i love it that's one of my
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.940]   favorite drinks to share in what context oh uh you're in italy
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:13.260]   and you've been walking around venice and everyone went their own ways and the whole family comes back
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:19.180]   together and you meet at a statue and and your wife's sweating and she's uncomfortable and your
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.700]   daughters are 16 and 18 and they're like what are we gonna what are we doing with the rest of the day
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.580]   and you go hey guys it's europe does anyone want to compari spritz and everyone goes i don't know
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.740]   what that is and you go for compari spritz now it's a minor in alcohol so it's not going to
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.820]   light them up but it gives them a little bit of a buzz where they're like dad these are nice
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:43.060]   island didn't drink hers so i drank hers i georgia had hers leanne had hers and we ordered another
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:52.100]   round i ordered an and they're refreshing and the buzz is perfect it's not too much because
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.900]   it's just a little bit of champagne and some campari if the buzz is perfect and then a couple
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.040]   of them and then they kind of disappear and then you're just walking around again that's
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:07.700]   a great drink you have a drink alone so there's a
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:14.640]   two kinds of alone one is alone like at a bar there's other people but they're strangers right
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.960]   you're kind of like out there okay i've done that keep going yeah keep going walk me through all the
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:25.260]   and then i'll tell you the rest there's all kinds of there's a alone on a train
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.800]   we're transporting i've dragged him alone on a train yeah train plane and then there's just
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   alone in the in an empty home or a hotel room hotel and it's sunday night sunday night and
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.580]   you're packing your bag and you're like oh my god i'm so tired i'm so tired i'm so tired i'm so tired
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.580]   and you're like i'm so tired i'm so tired i'm so tired i'm so tired and you're like oh my god you're
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.580]   like oh my god you're so tired i'm so tired i'm so tired i'm so tired i'm so tired and you get a bag
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:44.580]   and you get a flight at 6 00 a.m yeah but roadhouse is on and you're like so you get out of the front
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.580]   desk and go is the bar still open and they go yeah can i order some to take to my room sure how about
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:55.580]   six heinekens six heinekens yeah my wife wanted one too she's not up there you murdered her and
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:01.420]   you just say to yourself i'm just getting six so that if i have four i just know i have two extra
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:07.460]   ones and then you go through six and you're like oh man i'm not done yet dude i've drank in every
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:14.540]   drink i can possibly think of i've drank uh i've drank alone in a helicopter with a dude who didn't
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.500]   know i was drinking uh he was like i was like can i drink in here and he's like absolutely not and
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.460]   then i poured it into a flask and opened it and drank it and he's like dude we're in a fucking
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:28.220]   helicopter you don't think i smell that the best alone drinking you can ever do in my opinion now
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:33.860]   we're getting into the weeds on it is alone behind someone's back what do you mean like
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.140]   when they don't know you're drinking but you're drinking
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:45.300]   uh like christmas shopping ah and your wife says all right let's all split up and you go cool
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.860]   and it's like it's like 11 o'clock on a sunday and they just opened that bar by the elevator
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.620]   in the beverly center and you just sneak over and you go hey man can i get a double jack on the
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.580]   ross ox rots and they're like sure and you just have it you just go let's just and then you're
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.140]   off and then you're like yeah yeah and then you just little sneak one sneak it and sneak it and
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.620]   then you're buzzed and nobody knows and then your wife's like wait have you been drinking you're like
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:13.020]   yeah i'm drinking by myself in a fucking mall yeah on christmas how sad do you think i am and
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:20.460]   then you go yeah i am uh what about mood do you ever drink in a dark place so i broke i had a
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:25.580]   chick break up or a chick cheat on me uh when i was when i came back from russia and she slept
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:30.140]   with my best friend and i didn't know how to deal with the emotions i had and my buddy mike osborne
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:37.100]   said i can tell you this if you drink they go away and i went okay and that was the first and
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:44.440]   kind of last time i ever did that because i did it i've done it i've done it a couple times but
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:49.660]   i try to avoid i try to avoid if there's emotion going to alcohol like meaning
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:55.780]   not when it's anxiety but like depression yeah i kind of sit in the depression because or anxiety
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:01.860]   i lean towards alcohol like anxiety like about flying or or or just like getting worked up on
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.560]   over something but with depression i try to avoid alcohol and just sit in it
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:13.880]   um because i because i've gone there before i've but anxieties i land i land all the time
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.400]   but depression heartbreak all that you just sit in the feeling
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:23.040]   yeah heartbreak is a weird one for me so like the last time i got my heart broken at leanne dumped me
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.860]   um we were dating for like four months and she broke up with me and my instinct was to have a
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:33.020]   drink my friends went to this uh this uh middle eastern restaurant and i told him what was going
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.860]   on and my buddy corey's like let's get a cocktail and i was like i don't want one i gotta figure
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:42.700]   this out because i want this chick and if i start drinking i'll be like ah it so i gotta
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:48.380]   figure it out like i wonder i'm gonna find out my dad dies one day or my mom but my dad will be
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:55.180]   the rough one my mom will be equally as rough my dad and i are really close and i wonder if
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:01.420]   i've thought about this a lot if i'll have a drink dealing with that like i think about that a lot
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:06.740]   i keep saying everything i get with my dad is extra my dad my dad
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:12.620]   my dad had a 100 blockage in his widow maker twice and both times they saved his life and he got a
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:20.940]   stint i think 12 or 13 years ago and then he just got a stint this last year but so everything i get
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.820]   to do i feel like is extra and so you know he was just at the premiere of my movie and he got to see
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:31.180]   that and he had a very emotional response and i got i got that from him and i was like that that's
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.260]   a little icing on the cake i did you know the arena in tampa was the first time he ever saw me
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.620]   do stand up that was like a little bit of a shock to me and i was like i'm gonna do it again and i'm
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.900]   like a little extra so all these things i'm getting with them are all extra so i have a you
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:50.500]   know at least 74 so yeah that'll be a tough one well at the premiere he was what proud yeah he
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:55.940]   came out he was sobbing crying and he goes i've underestimated you your whole life and i was like
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.740]   what and he was like and he just and he was shaking yeah he goes i just underestimated you i
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.780]   didn't know i didn't know you i didn't know you were this i didn't whatever it was really hard to
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.500]   understand him to be honest with you
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.100]   i don't know totally what he said he might have just not liked the movie
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:18.360]   i think you uh were hearing what you wanted to hear uh what'd you learn about life from your
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:25.320]   father uh it's not gonna make sense i want to feel like sometimes i'm like a professional
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.700]   fucking wrestler because all i care about you come and see me do stand up so i whatever i
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:35.340]   gotta do to get you there but the number one thing my one takeaway from that man's humility and
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:41.540]   i applied i've applied it in different ways throughout my career on my 26th birthday he
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:50.200]   gave me a really uh aggressive speech he i was hung over and i just thought he was gonna say
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.220]   happy birthday so i picked up the phone and i was like hey and he was like you are a tremendous piece
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:01.320]   of shit and he broke me off you have no humility you have no this you've never succeeded anything
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.440]   you you're you're lying to yourself you're lying to everyone around you you're not doing what you're
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.260]   going after your dream
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.640]   i broke you i failed you as a father this and that i was like i thought you're gonna wish me
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:18.100]   happy birthday and so in that speech he told me if i wanted something i had to go at it and i had
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:24.020]   to go after it as as hard as i could and i had to do whatever it could i i could do to achieve that
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.980]   in this case it was working offering to do anything at the comedy club to get on stage
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:33.780]   he told me i told him that's not how it works and he said no that's how it works for some poor kid
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.140]   from harlem because that kid was a poor kid and he said no that's how it works for some poor kid
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:36.160]   he said no that's how it works for some poor kid and he said no that's how it works for some poor kid
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   he said no that's how it works for some poor kid and he said no that's how it works for some poor kid
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.480]   kid needs it he goes you've grown up with privilege your whole life you don't need it
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:45.780]   you think you're gonna be fine and so i went and i ended up getting a job at the door but i
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:51.100]   it was it was it's humbling it's it's really like uh it's it makes me feel it made me feel
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:58.240]   uncomfortable and so that humility uh is it's the first time i really understood humility and i've
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:04.600]   applied that in many respects in like in like getting to be a paid regular at the comedy store
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.020]   that happened late in life for me and i'm like i'm not gonna do that i'm not gonna do that i'm not
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:06.080]   gonna do that i'm not gonna do that i'm not gonna do that i'm not gonna do that i'm not gonna do that
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.160]   and which i think most people would give up and be like fuck that i'm already a touring comic i'm
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.580]   on tv i don't need that but it's something i wanted and i knew i wanted so i i just humbly
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:23.780]   went after it and then i think i i still apply it when it comes to selling tickets or or selling a
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:30.920]   project to the fans or even to doing podcasts i try to be as honest as i can about whatever i'm
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.540]   going through or whatever i'm dealing with but when it comes to like selling things i don't have
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.400]   i don't have a problem
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:35.900]   i don't have a problem
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:43.940]   trying to make fun of myself or or get in front of people so that they know that that i have a show
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:49.840]   because the thing i'm good at the the one thing i know i'm good at stand up and and i i say that
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.780]   humbly but like i want them to come there so like i've heard people make fun of me like before
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.540]   they're like yeah i'm not some i'm not some clown and a speedo who's one is gonna i'm a real comic
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:05.380]   and i go okay but i'm i want it i want them at my shows and you can be that guy and i'll be this guy
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:11.300]   yeah the clown the speedo yeah it's like what are you gonna do funny people make fun of me for taking
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:17.540]   my shirt off like i guess behind my back no one ever does it to me like no one would ever comics
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:24.980]   aren't comics aren't comics aren't that manly yeah yeah but i always go like i always go like
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:31.760]   what do you care what am i what do you care and you love taking shirt off more than anything
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.660]   you know when something becomes meme and becomes super popular
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:42.500]   it um it becomes easy to not love the thing anymore to get tired of it you still love it
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:49.780]   well more than anything i like being shirtless more than having a shirt i'm very uncomfortable
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:55.200]   in a shirt yeah like right now and i have tactile issues like i have legit tactile issues
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:03.040]   i'm most comfortable in stretchy jeans with a loose fitting belt and then these shirts exactly
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.540]   but i don't i'm i like more like a v-neck i feel i'm more comfortable in a shirt than a shirt
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:11.320]   i can feel this on my neck right now and i can feel it on my arms and so i'm i'll sit a certain
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:17.480]   way because it it just rubs me wrong but yeah i'm more comfortable shirtless i can never wear
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:24.220]   what you're wearing uh yeah well this is my shirtless we each of us have to find our place
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.320]   in this world in terms of fashion i would love to be able to wear what you wear yeah
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.640]   because it looks good it feels like an escape from convention
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.740]   well you or me
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:41.160]   both of us yeah because this nobody wears this unless you work security for somebody
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.880]   yeah but it looks good on you does it i don't know you know i think people think
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:52.640]   i don't like they would say like what what if you lose weight you can't take your shirt off
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.340]   anymore go no i'm gonna fucking take my shirt off yeah fucking out of your mind i take my
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.800]   shirt off all the time uh you mentioned uh early on heartbreak after the russia trip
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.300]   with a girl who slept with your friend um
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:11.120]   let's go back to hemingway quotes the best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:19.800]   them so to go all in with the trust i love hemingway so much um have you been betrayed
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:28.540]   in your life yeah what do you think about trust it's an interesting question um
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:35.180]   i've been betrayed in my professional life a couple times by really close friends and uh
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:44.340]   i'm not someone who can like i have a mantra that i mean i'm i don't know if people have heard it or
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:50.200]   not and i hate i hate sharing it but it's but it's true the mantra is so you think i'm weak
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   like do you think it's like that's my thing because i i feel like people take advantage
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.680]   of me and i go so you think i'm weak you forget everyone that like the and i'm named the the
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.060]   people that have betrayed me i'm a larger man than all of them
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.940]   and and but i and so that's what really fucks with me is i go so you think i'm weak like where
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:15.060]   i grew up when you do stuff there was physical consequences i grew up in florida like i've been
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.760]   beaten up a bunch i'm not saying i can fight but like i'm not scared of getting beaten up
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:26.720]   and the the times that i've been betrayed and and and even i know even like by ari whichever
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.840]   people see that drugging as a betrayal and i did for a period but it was it was only because it was
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.940]   ari and he was my one of my best friends and me and him had to
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:40.140]   work through that because i i couldn't not love him like i couldn't not have him in my life he
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:47.000]   means a lot to me he really does he's a great friend to have but he's also i don't know what
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   was going on with him at that time but he made a bad decision and i had to forgive him for that
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.600]   because i knew he he knew my mantra i think i'm harder to trust people now i'm not as apt to trust
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:03.060]   people at all but there was a moment i don't know if i've ever shared this and i don't know how this
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.820]   will sound but there was a moment
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.960]   that information got leaked about a thing and all my managers and agents
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:17.020]   both both tom and my tom and our managers and agents would like to uh separate either separate
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:23.700]   us or one of us one of them get both of us it's just more lucrative for them sure so they have
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:30.160]   always kind of pitted us against each other a little bit and they do it subtly um they'll do
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.700]   it to me and my team and then his team will do it to me and then my team will do it to him and
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.940]   his team will do it to him and there was a moment where information got leaked about this thing i
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:47.500]   was doing and my team was like just so you know your your boy tommy is is the rat and i had to
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:52.140]   it was the one time and leanne said do you think tom would do that
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:59.580]   i said i don't know how faith works like i'm not a super religious person but i
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:04.580]   will tell you that i believe in tom and i don't think he did it and i will stand by
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:10.840]   that ignorantly and and i will and i will ride or die with him because i cannot live in a world
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:17.620]   where i don't trust him yeah if i don't trust him then i am so fucked and uh and it wasn't him
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:23.600]   it wasn't him and it was it's a cool feeling to know that you could like that you could blindly
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.860]   trust someone blindly have faith in someone know that they're they have your best interest at heart
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:32.580]   but yeah it took me a while to get there rogan helped me get there because i wasn't trusting him
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.460]   or joey or tommy or anyone i wasn't trusting anyone i wasn't trusting anyone and i was like
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.780]   i wasn't trusting anyone i'd gotten in a bad thing and i just wasn't trusting anybody
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:43.860]   and rogan was like yo man we're trying to be your fucking friend and i was like yeah i don't i don't
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:49.540]   need friends i couldn't understand what why rogan was interested in me and i said to like someone i
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:55.380]   was like is he gay like what the fuck yeah and then he was just a nice guy he was just a nice guy
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:01.060]   that'd be hilarious if joe was sexually attracted to you this whole time
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.340]   this whole time is the reason he keeps inviting you back i would be more excited
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:09.980]   i would be more excited if just if he tried to kiss me on the lips once just and just and like
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:15.820]   in a scotty scotty j way from boogie nights where he's like what do you like my car yeah you know
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:21.420]   nobody would believe that story no one yeah if i was joe i would kiss dudes all the time and then
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:26.940]   and then when they didn't kiss back oh you know no one will ever believe you yeah when you trust
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:33.180]   people like that and they fuck you over that can really really really hurt you end up on a treadmill
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:39.220]   in a hotel room fighting with them you fight with them all the time you fight with them all the time
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:46.100]   you fight with them constantly and it's and i and i i have this uh thing like where i
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:51.140]   ruminate on an idea and i can't get it out of my head and i hear the words they say and i and i and
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:58.500]   so all in your head on a treadmill in your head just fighting just fucking fighting and then yeah
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.220]   and then one day you get past it like one day you just go
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:09.060]   fuck them i'm not gonna give them real estate and then you just forget about them and then they reach
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.500]   out and they'll try to be a dick or a bully because they're bullies they're bullies is what
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.580]   they are don't ever forget it they're fucking bullies and they got bullied it's not their fault
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:21.300]   they got bullied and then they try to bully you and you're and you don't have any connection
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.820]   anymore and you're like oh you can go fuck yourself you can actually go fuck yourself
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.940]   you're not my boss you're not my wife you don't fuck me you don't pay me
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:33.980]   get the fuck out of my life but this kind of mantra that you're not weak you still want to be able to
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:39.260]   be fragile to the world and appear weak almost i am i am i mean that's the problem is i think i am
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:44.380]   pretty fucking weak like i think i'm not the strongest dude out there i have really thin
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:51.420]   skin my feelings hurt all the time yeah and so but like but it sucks when you watch like
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:58.300]   your friend see something in you that you go right there you go ah fuck him he's not
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.100]   paying attention fuck him let's just fuck him let's take his money you know what fuck him
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.380]   he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing look at me he's a drunk alcoholic and you go oh no bitch i
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:12.740]   pay attention like i'm i'm wide awake i'm here i'm working my ass off you're not gonna fuck in
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.060]   well that's the tough thing about like you and tom segura you're at the
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.900]   top of your game on the top of the world some of the most famous comics in the world and
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:29.380]   you could see money start to creep in like uh business decisions yeah i don't know it's a tough
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.380]   it's a tough place it's really tough it's really tough for you know especially as we're growing
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.580]   and and uh
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:44.380]   i'll tell you what it i don't know how much i'm allowed to say but i can tell you this
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:53.260]   we had a business deal where feelings were getting involved and money was involved in
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:58.300]   that and the money was causing the feelings and one of us said
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:03.620]   to the other person our feelings are more important than the money so let's just
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:10.700]   split the money and it was and it was and it was and and it was it was really like a solid moment
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:16.700]   where i where both of us were like that is how we should run this yeah that's the interesting
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:23.820]   things like with bands you'll have like popular bands that split and even yeah even though it's
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:29.260]   clear that the contribution is not even it's like uh there's a front man and all that kind of stuff
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.700]   but it's ultimately the right thing to do to say fuck you to the money
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:39.940]   for the most part and prioritize the feelings yeah especially because like i couldn't do it
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:44.500]   without him he couldn't do it without me we do it separately we'll have guest bears on
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.580]   some will blow up some won't you can never figure it out but when we're together it does well
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.180]   and so we need each other for it to work and we've you know
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:58.900]   like i said we're on a handshake deal with two bears and no one likes that but we're like hey
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.380]   i mean we i don't like to the point where like he'll call me and go yo we
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:09.380]   have a deal to do this for x amount are you in and i go yeah i don't check the books i don't need to
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:14.740]   i don't i don't i know him i just know him yeah what do you love most about tom segura
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:22.820]   we saw a gay couple one time this is a good start and there was one guy was in
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:28.580]   khakis and one guy was in jean shorts with a python around his neck yeah and tom goes if
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:33.260]   we were gay which one would you be i said i'm python yeah and he was like yeah i'm
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.860]   khaki and i go really and he goes yeah that's why we work and he goes all relationships are
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.300]   for pythons and khakis and i went really and he goes look at you and leanne who do you think you

[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:56.700]   python but it's i'm usually a khaki yeah and i was like yeah i am a little bit of a lunatic
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:03.140]   i'll tell you the one of them a moment that explains me and him that the world of
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:07.020]   the world is a little bit more complicated than the world of the world but i'm like yeah i'm a
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.900]   little bit more complicated than the world of the world and i'm like yeah i'm a little bit more
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:16.300]   complicated than the world but i'm like yeah i'm a little bit more complicated than the world and
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.660]   i'm like yeah i'm a little bit more complicated than the world and i'm like yeah i'm a little bit
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:24.140]   more complicated than the world and i'm like yeah i'm a little bit more complicated than the world
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.260]   and i'm like yeah i'm a little bit more complicated than the world and i'm like yeah i'm a little bit
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.020]   more complicated than the world and i'm like yeah i'm a little bit more complicated than the world and
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:29.900]   i'm like yeah i'm a little bit more complicated than the world and i'm like yeah i'm a little bit more
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:30.980]   So we're like right next to each other.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.180]   And I just want to feel if it's swollen.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.100]   And it is a little swollen because I just got an injection.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.560]   And Tom's driving and he's got his hand on a thing.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.600]   He just puts his hand on my arm and he goes, you're okay.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:49.940]   He knows me so well that he knows that I'm spinning out of control.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:50.900]   He's like, you're okay.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.240]   And then I was like, and I felt okay.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.020]   I was like, you're right.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:54.500]   I'm okay.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.500]   What the fuck am I doing?
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.380]   My brain's that brain.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.020]   Man, that guy got so much love in him.
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.620]   Dude, he does.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:08.060]   He has, you know, he had a fantastic relationship with his dad.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:16.940]   And I think whatever that dude did to create that dude, he hit it out of the fucking park.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:25.000]   Because he has so much love that he doesn't need reciprocated like at all.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.340]   Like he can just love.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.620]   And then he feels.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.240]   It feels good for him to give and to like take care of someone.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.260]   And like, you know, he started the whole birthday gift thing.
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.420]   And he didn't need to.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.060]   He just was like, hey man, I had this bike.
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:37.840]   I thought you'd like it.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.820]   And then of course I've turned it into a fucking bit.
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.560]   And now we're upside down.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.740]   I'm 120 upside down on a fucking race car that we can't make our money back on.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:46.860]   I love it.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.380]   What do you love most about Joe Rogan?
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.220]   Oh, that dude.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.040]   I could go on and on about Joe Rogan.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.300]   Joe Rogan is the most selfless individual.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.940]   I've ever met.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.440]   He doesn't care if he has you on the podcast.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.660]   He wants you to be the funniest person in the room.
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.400]   He wants you to be the smartest person in the room.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.360]   Let me tell you something.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.620]   Joe Rogan is 10 times smarter and funnier than me.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.320]   He wants you to shine.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.340]   He wants you.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.000]   He wants to put you over to his fans.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.020]   He that shit did not exist before he started doing his podcast.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.980]   People didn't share you with their fans.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.020]   No one was like, hey man, come on on the road with me.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.140]   They brought you on the road because they wanted you to suck.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.700]   And they put you in bad scenarios.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.680]   Joe Rogan wanted you to shine.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.580]   He gave so many people beautiful careers.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.760]   Gave them careers.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.840]   Gave them.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.240]   Joe could have looked at his podcast as his thing.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.360]   This is my thing.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.260]   I bring on these guys.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.660]   I'm going to be the funniest guy in the fucking room.
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.880]   I know some guys that have done that.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.220]   It might be me.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.480]   I might talk over people and not listen really well.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.960]   Joe did the opposite.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.860]   Now, look, I've tried to learn from Joe on my podcast and do the same.
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.980]   That guy.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.220]   When you think about it, you name 10 of his friends,
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.600]   I bet eight of them are doing arenas right now.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.340]   They're all doing theaters.
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.540]   All his friends do theaters.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.660]   All his friends do theaters.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:13.140]   He is just, you know, and he won't accept this compliment.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:19.320]   I tried paying it to him in Austin when I was in Austin last night.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.700]   Well, he's not good at accepting compliments.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.060]   I gave him a gift too.
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.040]   And I said, hey, I need to show you.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.640]   I can't just tell you this because it's going to fall in deaf ears.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:26.820]   I need to give it to you.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:31.960]   I need to give you a minute so you have something so you know that I think about you.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.340]   And I'm grateful for having you in my life a lot for many reasons.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.040]   I have more friends in my life because of you.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.840]   He taught me how to trust people again.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.900]   I have a career because of you.
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.340]   I have a major motion picture because of you.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.500]   I do arenas because of you.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.200]   Without you in my life, a lot of these things maybe never would have happened.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.640]   I never would have told the machine on stage.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.300]   I wouldn't have gotten, I would have never started a podcast.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.140]   I wouldn't have three podcasts.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:56.560]   I mean.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:03.340]   All these things are things he not just, he didn't just take me to the water one time and give me a drink.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.020]   He gave me a machete and he said, this is how I get to the water.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.860]   You got to put your own path, but just give me a heads up.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.880]   You can also use my path whenever you want.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.640]   I mean, he is the most selfless individual.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:20.300]   He will go down in history as one of the 10 most important people in standup comedy, without a doubt.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.300]   He changed the game.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.360]   It didn't exist like this before him.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.820]   And he won't accept that compliment.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.000]   He's a gift.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.500]   You gave him.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.220]   I can't tell you.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.120]   Is it a dildo?
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.060]   It was a dildo.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.380]   It was a double-sided dildo.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.800]   I go, Hey, when you get free time, can we scissor fuck each other?
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.380]   You're happily married for 19 years.
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.120]   So I think you're a good man to ask.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.060]   How do you find love?
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:47.700]   How do you find, how do you date in order to find a love of your life of a lifetime?
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:54.220]   This is going to sound off, but don't.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.180]   Don't tie yourself down.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:06.580]   Meaning like, don't spend time fucking with those little mini shrimp and peeling them every night when you know you're looking for a lobster.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:13.860]   Like, and so I think what happens a lot of guys, they just, they're so busy and like just getting pussy and going from here to here to here.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:14.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.100]   I was never that guy.
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.460]   I always wanted, I always wanted to find someone who understood me.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.460]   I always wanted that.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:26.180]   And so I know granted, I haven't had sex with a lot of chicks, but that's, and it's, and it's not by choice.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:32.620]   I'm saying like, maybe there was times I would have done it, but I, but I know that I was always looking for someone to figure out to get me.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:45.000]   And then, and then I will say this when, you know, you know, when you know, you know, when you think there's, I can't imagine a life without this person that, that, that happened to me.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.540]   And I can only say my experiences.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.940]   I had Leanne.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.280]   I loved her.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.700]   And I, and I didn't even realize it.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.820]   And the second she dumped me, I went, oh no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.020]   Oh, I, I.
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.000]   I don't get to live a great life without her.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.520]   She's the thing that's going to give me a great life.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.500]   I knew it undisputed.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.840]   I went for a run and she dumped me.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.480]   I went to my shower.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:06.960]   I cried.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.820]   I went to Barnes and Noble.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.720]   I bought men are from Venus.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.520]   Women are from Mars.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.980]   I've watched fight club in my closet.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.980]   I didn't drink.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.260]   I drank a lot of NyQuil to sleep.
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.300]   And then I went for a hike in Runyon Canyon.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.960]   I was running back down outpost by Ben Affleck's house and, and the sun was setting.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.980]   And I just said, God, if you're listening.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.100]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.380]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.460]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.480]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.560]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.640]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.720]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.800]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.940]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.020]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.100]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.180]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.260]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.280]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.360]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.420]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.480]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.540]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.620]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.720]   I'm going to be a great man.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.860]   I didn't know he was real.
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.320]   I was like, shit, man.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.360]   Give me like one more night.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.220]   Let me get some strange tail real quick before I commit forever.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.160]   But I think when you know, you know.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.920]   This is so silly, but I follow that in business.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.420]   Like when you know, you know, and like my assistant's with us,
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.120]   and someone goes, how do you find a good assistant?
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.040]   I go, when you know, you know.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.940]   Like people will show you who they are.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.780]   I can tell you when I fell in love with my assistant.
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.560]   We were doing a TV show, and we worked past dinner,
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.560]   and all the dinner places were closed.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:17.580]   And I was like, what?
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:17.640]   What?
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:17.680]   What?
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:17.700]   What?
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:17.700]   What?
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.260]   And he just said, hey, I got like four meals.
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.160]   I didn't know which one you'd want.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.980]   So I got four different meals for you.
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.820]   I ordered them.
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.520]   They're up in your room.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.880]   And just let me know whichever you want.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.040]   I'll take care of the rest of them.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.320]   And I was like, oh, that dude thinks about other people before himself.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.840]   He didn't even get himself dinner.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.540]   He just got me four dinners.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.140]   And I was like, fuck.
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.960]   I did the same thing with my social media manager.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:42.120]   The way she was operating was I was like, I feel like she's thinking about me.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.640]   And we connected on so many levels.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.640]   On so many levels, I could talk to her about things and ideas.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.020]   I had.
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.040]   And then I was like, OK, I want her.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:49.560]   I want him.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:49.960]   I want.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.420]   I think it's got to be that thing when you know you know.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:44:00.400]   And it can be so simple as like a personal trainer or like a jujitsu class
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.400]   or like just where you go, oh, I'm connecting right now.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.100]   But you have to allow yourself to notice that person.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.500]   I think you do.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.220]   I mean, I think you have to put yourself out there.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.000]   And you have to be available for it.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.040]   That's the hardest part is just being available for it.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.620]   Because so many people just want to be busy.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:18.960]   Just dating.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.740]   I just want to have someone in my life.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.340]   I don't want to be bored.
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:21.720]   I don't want to.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.740]   What if I die alone?
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.560]   I don't want to.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.600]   I like just be available for it.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.780]   What is it?
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.460]   You said peeling the baby shrimp.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.700]   When you could be having a lobster.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.740]   Lobster is still a lot of work.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:34.360]   I have to say.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.580]   But yeah, but it's lobster.
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.080]   This is a fucking baby shrimp or like you ever get.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.840]   So you ever get the ones in Brazil where you just go fucking.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.460]   I'll eat the shell.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.300]   I don't care anymore.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.040]   Like I'm so fucking hungry.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.600]   You just handful of lobster like it's popcorn or baby shrimp.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.180]   Like it's popcorn.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.700]   I've done that in Vietnam.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:51.860]   I've done that where I just go.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:52.940]   It's too much work.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.520]   So when you're in it, what's the secret to successful marriage?
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.400]   What do women want?
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.580]   Bird crusher.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.320]   Oh, fuck.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.020]   That's I'm the wrong guy to answer that.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:03.980]   I think.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.440]   How to make love to a woman by bird crusher.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.500]   How do you make love to a woman?
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.800]   I'll tell you how I do it.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.080]   I go down on her first.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.580]   Make sure she has an orgasm.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.800]   And then I get my turn and that's over pretty quick.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.420]   It's like, it's like your ears pierced.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.840]   It'll feel a little prick and it's over.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:30.260]   I, um, I don't know if I've done a great job.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.800]   Keeping her happy.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.320]   I think I keep her interested.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.740]   Like, I think I, I, I, I keep her occupied.
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.960]   Like I'm like a little bit of a rodeo clown.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.420]   Like, I don't know.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.680]   I mean, like I, I know we're happy right now.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.840]   I know we're really happy.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:53.100]   But I don't know if I ever did as good a job as she did.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:58.620]   Like she's always been like, she's always been a gangster.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:59.780]   Like done, did everything.
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:00.460]   Just does everything.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.180]   She does it all.
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.020]   She does everything.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.380]   Like fucking everything.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.060]   And she loves it.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:04.880]   She just does it.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.260]   And then she shows love for you by taking care of you.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:13.240]   And so like, I have a lot of time just been this, like, almost like step and repeat husband
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.260]   where it's like, I come in to take a picture.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.240]   Like, Hey, Monday, Tuesday.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:18.780]   All right.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.460]   I'm on the road Wednesday.
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.220]   Take care of guys.
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.580]   Or like travel channel.
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:22.760]   I'd live for two weeks at a time.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.160]   I left for the movie for three months.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:29.760]   So like, I don't know that I've ever done a bang up job.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.100]   I buy it.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:34.580]   Like I go, I remember one time I was just like, I don't cheat on her.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:35.480]   I don't hit her.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.620]   I don't yell at her.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.980]   I'm a pretty good fighter.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.960]   I'm a really good fighter.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.260]   Like, like I'm good at like going like, Hey, we're on the same team.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.040]   Oh, you mean de-escalation?
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.660]   I'm really good at like, I'm.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.240]   Very self, I'm very accountable.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.460]   I'm very self-correcting.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.980]   Like if, if we're in a fight and she points something out and I go, Oh, you're right.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.600]   I go, fuck, you're right about that.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:55.980]   You're right.
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:56.420]   You're totally wrong.
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.000]   Oh, in the moment.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:57.540]   In the moment.
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.440]   I'm really good at that.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.380]   Huh?
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.620]   And my wife's not, she's not a good apologizer.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.920]   Like she needs to sleep on an apology and then she can do it.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:10.420]   I can apologize in the moment if I realize I'm wrong and I'm really quick to find my fault.
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.540]   I look for my fault because I go, tell me what I did.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.120]   Adversely as a parent.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:21.640]   I have pulled my daughters aside and been like, yo, that wasn't you.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.000]   That was mom.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.880]   I'm giving you a heads up.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.760]   Cause I don't want, cause I got, I got really confused as a kid.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.120]   Cause my dad always made sure I knew I was wrong.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.240]   And sometimes I wasn't.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.060]   And then as a kid, you're kind of fucked up and you're like, well, how do I know if I'm
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:35.220]   wrong?
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.260]   And I think that raises, so I was really good with my girls going like, yo.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.420]   And then, and then parenting Georgia taught me a lot about self-correcting.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.400]   Self-correcting.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:43.780]   What's that?
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:44.800]   My oldest.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.920]   I'd only, I parented like my dad parented, like just like raise your voice, get up to
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.120]   here.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:51.620]   That's it.
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:52.960]   No, that doesn't fuck this.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.880]   How come the dogs don't have goddamn leashes on the collars on their necks.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:03.480]   And so with Georgia, I had to learn through therapy that if the, if the, if the consequence
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:08.580]   is here and it, and the highest it goes is here, then why the fuck wouldn't they lie
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.100]   and do everything?
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:13.020]   Cause they go, well, I know what it's like to hear, but if you can vary your consequence
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:16.640]   with a child and find some.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.940]   Conversation in it, then all of a sudden they're like, well, fuck.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.880]   Well, I don't wanna lie.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.140]   Cause this does, this does suck.
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:23.980]   I like this.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.980]   I like where we talk and he says, write a thousand words on why driving around your
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.880]   kids in a car, kids in a car is bad.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.580]   So threaten extreme violence every once in a while.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.080]   Just.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.580]   Let them know the dog can fucking bite.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.040]   The dog can bark, the dog can bite, but if you pet him on his belly, a wag its tail.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.440]   Uh, do you worry about being away too much?
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:46.040]   I mean, you're.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:51.660]   One of the most creative content pushers and creators out there.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.100]   You're just constantly innovating, constantly putting stuff out there.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:59.360]   But do you worry that pulls you away from like, uh, the mundane experience of life?
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:48:59.740]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:01.560]   That can bring contentment and happiness.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:07.000]   I feel like sometimes it cannibalizes your real life where you start going, you start
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.200]   thinking in promo videos or you start looking at a vacation as a bit.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.160]   Like we should go zip lining.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.760]   Whoa, Ida.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.040]   Why, why don't you do.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.460]   Ah, what shoes?
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.000]   You wear an eye?
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.060]   Like it can, it can definitely cannibalize your life.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:26.120]   My wife's really good at going like, no, like no phones.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.920]   The girls are really good.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:32.420]   The girls, when I started Instagramming stuff, they started saying stuff like dad hits mom.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.160]   And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.220]   They're like, no, put your phone away.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:35.660]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.000]   Dad, dad, and less boys.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.820]   And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:46.420]   Uh, what's, um, what are some secrets, words of wisdom you can say for how to be successful online and online?
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.480]   All the, everything you've learned, you're kind of like the, the Mr.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:50:01.360]   Beast of comedy, just innovating constantly in terms of how to promote stuff in terms of how to present stuff across the different social media, across YouTube podcast, all that stuff.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.980]   I think the number one thing is don't be afraid to suck.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.780]   No one sees the shit that sucks.
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.360]   Doesn't get views.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.580]   It just gets forgotten.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:11.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.980]   It gets forgotten the good stuff they remember.
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.360]   And then that's all they bring up the stuff that sucks.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.020]   It just goes away.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:18.400]   And they're like, oh yeah, did you do that?
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.900]   I, I don't even think I saw that.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.040]   Fuck it.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:21.500]   Who cares?
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.180]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:29.260]   You know, it's like, it's like I watched, I, one of my favorite stories about this is, uh, a guy named, uh, Sean Patton.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:33.100]   I was explaining Instagram stories to him and Ari and Mark Norman.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.820]   And I was explaining that you can set now sell tickets on Instagram stories.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.240]   It was back when they swiped up instead of tap the button, swipe up and they didn't understand it.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.240]   And I said, let me show you.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.320]   And I put up tickets for sale and I said, you know, Hey guys, swipe up.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.560]   And then I just showed him in 10 minutes.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.780]   Look, this is how many people swiped up.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:49.860]   It's 145 people.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:50.100]   Mm-hmm.
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.320]   It's a lot of people to buy tickets for a fucking comedy club.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.700]   And they were like, whoa.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.680]   And they're like, what do you do stories about?
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.000]   I go fucking anything who gives a shit, just anything.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.460]   And some things work, some things don't.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:08.920]   And I watched Sean Patton shout out to Sean Patton, try for about 15 minutes to do an Instagram story about, uh, his cup of tea.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:13.480]   He was making cup of tea and he was making, and he kept going, Hey, you got, okay, hold on.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:13.740]   Fuck it.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:14.040]   Hold on.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.260]   Let me, yeah, I was filming him from the couch.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.520]   I was filming all these attempts.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.020]   The whole thing.
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.740]   I filmed every single one of my like 15 different stories of him trying to do that.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.740]   I had 145,000 views on each story.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.760]   Mm-hmm he never posted it.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.740]   He never posted it.
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:32.060]   And I was like, I was like, man, if he had just posted that one, he never posted anything in his stories.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:38.540]   That one, 145, 5,000 people would have gone to his story to see that cup of tea being made and see which one he finally went with.
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:42.740]   And so sometimes I think the biggest mistake you can make is just not doing it.
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:43.640]   Just do it.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.240]   Just post it, turn the camera on the idea will show.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.160]   And that's the number one thing.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.960]   Just turn the camera on and it'll come up.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:50.860]   You'll figure it out.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.120]   Do you do multiple takes or no?
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.500]   Maybe I do three.
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:59.320]   Like, and I'm talking even like in the, the dance video I did where I did the hip hop dance, I did two takes on that.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:51:59.860]   Mm-hmm.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.640]   Um, with, when I had the marching band come to my house, I did two takes on that.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.840]   Um, once you start doing more takes, you, you lose the fun of it.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:08.680]   I think.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:16.200]   And, uh, and then the fun ones, I mean, my favorite one I've ever done without a doubt, my favorite one.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:29.280]   My favorite promo I've ever done is, uh, I needed, they added a second show in some city and, uh, and, and they added a second show like Friday and Saturday and our third show.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.340]   And I said, I, they just told me, I was like, fuck, I'm leaving like tomorrow.
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.300]   I need to sell tickets.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.600]   So I said real quick, girls meet me outside and Leanne's like, girls are doing homework.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.680]   I go to take five seconds.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.760]   I put on a speedo.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.780]   I got the American flag.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.800]   I gave Isla the hose.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.280]   I gave Leanne the leaf blower and I gave Georgia the drone.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.160]   And I just had Georgia.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:53.420]   Drone it back to reveal the leaf blower and the, the mist you were seeing was coming from Isla and Leanne.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:53.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.280]   I'm in a speedo with American flag.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.380]   I have Bob Seger plan rambling, grambling man.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:58.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:05.360]   And, and that night, Larry, the cable guy texted me and he goes, this is fucking genius.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:09.920]   And I was like, it was just, and it was just like, yo, just, let's just shoot something who gives a fuck.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.880]   Like just shoot something.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:16.120]   Just, just, just say something and, and, and, and put a little, just do a little.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.500]   Just a little movement into it.
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:20.020]   And, and those are my back in the hours.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.900]   I used to be, I watched a bunch of my promo clips back from back in the day.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:23.980]   I used to be really good.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.520]   Now it's like, I'm promoting so fucking many things.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.280]   I'm just like, I'm almost like I'm exhausted about my promotions.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:31.660]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.540]   Because you know, the, the, well can dry up in terms of ideas.
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.060]   And it's like, how many times am I going to show a picture of my ass?
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.380]   My ass sells really good.
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:43.540]   Whatever my ass is on Instagram, fucking million views, guaranteed a million views.
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:44.320]   Your ass.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.640]   And, and, and, and.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.720]   And it's, and it's an active post.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.560]   Like people are like, I did the best one I did the other day was where I superimposed
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.320]   my ass on my front and it just looked beautiful.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.440]   No views.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.380]   Oh, so you.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:58.100]   It got reported.
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.340]   Oh, I see.
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:00.240]   It looked like a front vagina.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.780]   Oh, is that what it was?
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:02.520]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.840]   But like, but yeah, my ass.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:05.600]   Ass sells.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:11.320]   Like I'm, I'm in a place right now where I am promoting, I'll be promoting this movie.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.620]   I'll be promoting this movie until it goes to a streamer.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:15.740]   I'll be promoting it.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.440]   Uh, shamelessly.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.220]   I am proud of it.
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:19.800]   I had a great time shooting it.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.880]   It's in theaters.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.000]   It'll be on video on demand.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.100]   It'll be on a streamer.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:24.400]   I'm sure.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.260]   I don't know, but I'm sure I'm promoting fully loaded my summer festival with 19 different
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:29.580]   comics.
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:33.600]   I'm promoting the tops off world tour that starts again this fall.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.840]   I'm promoting my cruise, the fully loaded cruise.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.280]   I'm promoting red rocks.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:44.340]   I'm promoting so many things that today was the very first time in my career where I said
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:45.600]   in January.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:45.740]   I'm going to do this.
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:45.840]   I'm going to do this.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.580]   I'm going to take a break.
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:51.200]   I'm going to take a break and go like, Hey man, let's, let's get your resting heart rate
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:51.600]   down.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.380]   Let's, let's get some sleep.
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.560]   Let's, let's maybe take off like three months from drinking.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:02.820]   Like let's just really like slow it down and, and, and also not think when you're thinking
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:06.520]   in promo all the time, it, it can be a little exhaust.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.840]   I mean, you think, you think it's exhausting to look at my feed.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.380]   It's exhausting to be my feed.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.180]   I'm my feed.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:14.180]   That's not as less as more.
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.680]   One of the things.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:15.940]   Nope.
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:16.540]   Nope.
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:17.280]   Nope.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:25.780]   One, one of the things that inspires me about Rogan, for example, is, um, he almost never
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.080]   does this kind of stuff.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.640]   And how seldomly does his podcast.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.320]   Cause you're right.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:30.860]   Less is more.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.380]   How, what does he do it like once a month?
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.180]   No, he does it three times a fucking week.
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.980]   More is more is more is perfect.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:41.420]   But for example, when he does like a story or something like this, he does one take.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.420]   It's kind of shitty.
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:45.520]   It's the same day.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:45.780]   It's the same day.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:45.940]   It's the same.
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:51.180]   It's elk with a bunch of jalapenos, a knife that he had sent to him by a fucking knife
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.380]   maker and him going, look at this.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.020]   Look at this.
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:55.120]   It's a Traeger smoker.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.500]   I reverse seared this.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.380]   This is what's great.
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:57.720]   Look at this.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.640]   I'm about to put it in the butter.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.420]   Like this is grass fed butter.
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:02.220]   This elk really raises my testosterone.
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:06.060]   Rogan is it's you're right with guys like Rogan.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.340]   When he does do a story, they're a little precious.
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.680]   And there's, I don't think he's, he's ever done a second take.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.980]   No, you have to really admire that.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:23.120]   Like, uh, if the shot is framed poorly, if the audio sucks, doesn't matter.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:36.620]   Does that you remember when he, this is like, like I can get in the weeds on Rogan, but, and especially when it's Instagram, do you remember when he got his polar plunge and he couldn't sit in a minute and then the next day, and then he must've gotten it on the internet bad.
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.600]   He must've gotten it bad.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:38.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:45.720]   The next day he sat in for 20 minutes and he lowered his core temperature by like two degrees and it took him like a month.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.440]   To get that back.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:46.660]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.560]   That is that fucking man.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.400]   What an interesting, you know, I told you at the beginning, we were just talking.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   I like, I really enjoy, I draw inspiration from men.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:01.880]   I'm not like, um, you, David Goggins, Cam Haynes.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.000]   Um, Andrew Huberman.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.940]   Huberman.
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:10.120]   I love, uh, uh, uh, fucking, I mean, there's so many guys like that.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.120]   Rogan, you know, Tim Kennedy.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.100]   Like there are a lot of guys that are like.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.180]   Just very different men than me.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:18.860]   And I love Jocko Wilnick.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:28.400]   Like I love, I love reading their stuff or listening to their audio books or listening to their podcast because I'm so not like that.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:40.580]   But that to, for me, when I add a little bit of that in my life, like I remember you went, I don't know what you were doing, but you were walking us through your day and it was so fascinating.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:44.960]   It was like, it was like, I ran eight miles today.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:45.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:45.640]   I listened to.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.180]   I listened to an audio book.
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.160]   I was running eight miles.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.100]   And then I came and I worked for about three hours straight on AI stuff.
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.780]   And I'm like, and I was like, wait, you sat at a desk?
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:59.660]   Like you like sat at a desk and like, and I, I actually, I wouldn't even know what to do.
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.120]   I would start doing crafts.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.780]   Like I wouldn't like that you went, I was like, is your computer like.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:06.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:12.200]   Have you sat for like four hours focused on a single task?
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:12.920]   Me?
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.340]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:13.820]   No.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:13.960]   No.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.280]   I have a hard time sleeping for four hours.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.940]   Like I, I don't have that.
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:25.800]   I, I don't have a brain that like, I really admired it when I listened to you do it.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.640]   Cause then you were like, you were talking, you were fasting at the time you were doing your fast.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:32.840]   And then you talk about what you ate and I was jealous.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.540]   I wanted to be able to be like that.
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:38.380]   And I think at that time we started, I think you were doing maybe bone broth or something.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:43.340]   And we started doing bone broth pretty religiously and adding that into a fast.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:45.480]   Cause I was like, it does.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.900]   For someone like me, it does feel cool to add a little bit of control into life.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:54.880]   So integrating a little bit of a way of being from another person that you're not like.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.180]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:59:00.400]   Like, like, uh, like, so, so David Goggins is consistently pushing himself.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.180]   I love, I did it.
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:06.320]   I did it over the pandemic more, but I loved going today.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.080]   I'm running a marathon.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:11.040]   I'm going to get on the treadmill and it's not going to be all at once, but I'm going
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.800]   to get through a marathon today.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:15.440]   So let's get up, get up at six o'clock from college.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.340]   I'm going to get a cup of coffee and let's see if we can do like five miles and then
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.340]   know that we started there.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:25.200]   And that was really fun to, to, to, to like, um, Cam Haynes does that too, where he goes,
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:30.980]   like, he almost just sets the limit and then, and then achieves that his son Truett is really
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:31.980]   fascinating.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:35.500]   Cause his son Truett right now is trying to get the, and like, I bet people would never
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:40.740]   think that this is why I watch, but I get real inspiration from those people because
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:44.060]   I showed Jocko, I showed a clip to Jocko to Isla.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.060]   Cause Isla's like me.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.280]   Like a, a person of her fluids, impulse.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.320]   I w I walked in on her one time.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:58.200]   She was in the pantry in a bathrobe in the dark drinking a root beer.
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.820]   And I opened the door and she went, I said, what?
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.220]   She goes, I thought you were mom.
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.440]   Shut the door.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.080]   And I shut the door to let her finish the root beer.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.080]   She has a hard time waking up.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.080]   So go Isla come in here.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.860]   I want you to see this clip from Jocko.
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.860]   She goes, who's Jocko?
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.200]   I said, he's a Navy seal.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   She goes, he works at the Navy.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.200]   He works at the zoo.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:19.660]   I went, no, he's a Navy seal.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:20.660]   I go, it's a bad-ass job.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.660]   She goes, it's a silly name.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.880]   And I went, no, it's not.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.260]   It isn't a silly name.
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.800]   These guys are the toughest dudes in the world.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.340]   She goes, she's kind of right though about the silly name.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.340]   I never even realized that.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.340]   Oh yeah.
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.340]   You talk to a child.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.340]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.700]   And so I go, watch this, what he says about waking up.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:38.880]   So it hits the thing and Jocko goes, first thing you do when you hear that alarm clock,
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.040]   you could roll over, you could go back to bed, you could hit snooze, but you get out
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.080]   of bed and that's your first victory.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.080]   And Isla has paused.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:49.520]   She goes, how great is that nap right after you hit snooze though?
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.520]   I went, it is pretty funny.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.520]   I go, hang on.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.520]   It is great.
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.520]   You're missing the point.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.520]   You're missing this whole speech.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.120]   He's with Casey Neistat when he's telling this speech.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.120]   He's with Casey Neistat.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.840]   And so I hit it and then he goes, and then you've got a victory under your belt.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.520]   Then you go to the gym and you work out and I go, are you listening to Isla?
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.520]   And she goes, yeah.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.800]   And he goes, and then when you go to the work, now you've got two victories.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.560]   You've worked out and you've woken up on time.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.080]   You didn't hit that snooze button.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.960]   So when you go into that break room and you see Donas and she hits pause, she goes, if
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.080]   he's about to say no to donuts, I'm done listening.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.080]   I go, he's definitely gonna say no to donuts.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.080]   Do you think he's gonna have a donut?
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.080]   And she goes, you like this guy?
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   I go, I fucking love him.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.080]   And she goes, do you think he'd like you?
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.080]   And I go, what do you mean?
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.200]   She goes, dad, you hit snooze, you skip working out and you love donuts.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.460]   And I'm like, yeah, you're making a good fucking point.
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.860]   I go, I, but I, but I do love that.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:42.960]   Like I love to watch that brain work and go like, like, I don't, I don't hit snooze.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.840]   Like I don't hit snooze.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.700]   Now I go fuck it.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.120]   Cause I'm up.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.880]   But I, and then, and then I go to the gym every single morning.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.060]   I go to the gym every single morning and today's national donut day.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.820]   I didn't have a donut.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.460]   And so like, I, I like, I try, I like try to apply these a little bit.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:01.960]   Cause I, I mean, the other side of me is like tonight after we do this, I'll do another
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.000]   podcast and then I'm gonna call Leanne and go, yo, we're in Beverly Hills.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   Meet me out here.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Let's go have drinks.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.720]   Let's go have fucking couple Kapari spritz.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.720]   Let's I was over at a friend's house and overnight, let's get some edibles and let's fucking have
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.720]   a night about it.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.720]   Get some sushi, go have sex in the hot tub.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.720]   And I gotta work out at fucking 10 in the morning.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.960]   I gotta tell you that nap when you press snooze is the sweetest.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.460]   That's my, that's my victory.
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:30.480]   First victory is pressing snooze and getting the nap onto the belt.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.280]   I have you ever had, I had, so this, this morning I didn't work.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   I didn't work out.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.400]   I'd press it like five in the morning until about six.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.600]   You're going hard right now.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600]   And then I had a podcast.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.600]   I saw you.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.600]   I saw Austin.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.600]   I was like, what, huh?
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.600]   What?
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.280]   Just run around theaters and now you're back.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.380]   Running around theaters to do, to promote the movie.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.680]   And then look you only get one shot at these movies, so you might as well do.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.840]   And look, it's really hard to get people to go into a movie theater right now.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:07.160]   And so I woke up at like six, did five or six to seven, did press.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:13.480]   And then I went and I said, and I'm really into a podcast, a history podcast right now.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.480]   And I was listening to this one about the conquistadors.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:20.280]   And I was, and I was like, before when I woke up, I was like, I wouldn't mind going back
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.280]   to that.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.720]   And I said, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna take a little nap and go.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.720]   Now I slept good last night.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.240]   I slept like seven hours last night.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.140]   Boy, that 30 minute nap, it felt like five hours.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:36.480]   And I woke up going, I gotta readjust my sleep score.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.480]   That has to be in the 97.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.980]   That was the best fucking nap.
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:41.480]   Those little snooze naps are monsters.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480]   You know, there's, I don't know.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.160]   You know, there's, I don't care.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:50.240]   That's probably for me, one of the peak experiences of life is those naps.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.240]   I don't know what that is.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.720]   Have you ever slept in a tour bus?
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.720]   A tour bus versus a regular bus?
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.840]   Like a tour bus.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.720]   Like meaning like in a bunk.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.720]   No.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.720]   I've taken a lot of buses in my life though.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.240]   Like mean like just like a, like a Greyhound?
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.240]   Those are very different.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.360]   And uh, public transit.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.360]   Listen, they.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:16.200]   That's just part of, part of life in a Greyhound.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.200]   I was on a Greyhound one time.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.200]   Don't put stuff in your pockets.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.120]   I was on a Greyhound one time right when Notorious B.I.G.'s album came out in college.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.240]   And I was going from Tallahassee down to Tampa.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:30.520]   And the dude got on the tour bus, got on the bus next to me, black dude.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.120]   And he sat down, he said, where are you headed?
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.120]   And I said, Tampa.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.120]   He said, you grew up in Tampa?
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.120]   I said, yeah.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.120]   I said, you?
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.120]   And he goes, yeah.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.120]   I said, you go to school with Pham?
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.360]   And because Pham, you and Flores say the two schools, one's black, one's white.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.360]   And he goes, no, I don't go to school with Pham.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.360]   And he goes, no, I just got out of prison.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.000]   I said, you got out of prison?
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   And he goes, yeah.

[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.520]   I stabbed a dude and I've been in prison.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.520]   I just got out today.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.940]   He goes, what are you listening to?

[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.240]   No, he's not enjoying it.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.240]   He's like, he's not enjoying it.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.240]   He's like, I don't know.

[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:33.480]   It's like a coffin and it is ice cold.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.640]   And you got all your pillows and blankets in there.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:41.720]   And you put a little history podcast on in the corner and you just listen to like Kurt
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.720]   Mboshi or like, oh my God.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.400]   So you're talking about like 5, 6:00 PM for a 7:00 PM show.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.300]   Oh, it's the best nap you'll ever have.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:52.420]   You wake up so refreshed.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.420]   Yeah.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:57.120]   Like I've woken up from naps like where I'm like, fuck yeah.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.500]   Like there are those, those tour bus naps are the best naps.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:08.000]   I think having a full productive day and then like 5, 6:00 PM to get a nap and then you
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.540]   do something really stressful after that.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:13.500]   Like really hyper, like, like a show.
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:18.360]   But if I do like, I really liked doing podcasts like late at night after a nap.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:22.200]   I think I fucked up my podcast rhythm because we're doing them in the day.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.000]   And so sometimes I'm just like, I like, if I work out in the morning, I'm good on a podcast,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   but if I don't work out.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   I suck on a podcast.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   And I'm just like, uh-huh.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   That's cool.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   No, I, I, I'm my favorite is I used to do this a lot.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.660]   I haven't done it in a while is a full busy day nap at home, box of wine on the treadmill
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:51.000]   and do that until like midnight watching TV, box of wine.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.880]   Box of wine on a treadmill.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   It's the best.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.880]   How are you?
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.880]   Wait, how are you sipping it?
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.880]   Jake?
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.880]   I don't know if you're a box, but you have a box.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880]   The box fits on the corner on the treadmill.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.880]   Of course it does.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.880]   So you just got a little spigot.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.880]   And you just sit there and just put on like guys, grocery games or like just something.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:05.880]   It's like a.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.880]   You walking or are you running?
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.880]   I walk, I walk at like a three, five.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   So what'll happen is if you start at three, start at three, casual walk, 20 minutes, you're
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.880]   gonna mile in and then you, and you're gonna feel loose.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:10.880]   Get up to a three, five.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.880]   You can do seven miles on these things and just, and just, and you're just enjoying your
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.880]   night.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.880]   Especially like my wife back in the day when we lived in our old house, my wife would come
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:14.880]   into the man cave and she'd sit on the couch and we watched TV together.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.880]   And like watch Game of Thrones and you just like for an hour and you just get on the treadmill
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   and do it.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.880]   Oh man.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.880]   I, I loved having done that as much lately.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:20.880]   That was the fucking best.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880]   So you're gonna lose yourself.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.880]   You're gonna forget yourself.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:23.880]   You forget you're on a treadmill.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.880]   And you just start like walking and you're sweating and you're, and you're having a
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.880]   hard time.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.880]   Yeah.

[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:10.100]   And so I'm drinking an IPA out of a growler in a bathtub at six in the morning and it
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:11.820]   just didn't sit right.
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:15.520]   And I threw it up and I was off IPAs for like 10 fucking years.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:21.320]   I didn't have another IPA until I was like 46 cuz I was like, all I could think about
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.820]   was throwing up that IPA.
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:23.820]   I was like, I'm gonna throw up thinking about it.
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:24.820]   I was like, I'm gonna throw up thinking about it.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:25.820]   But yeah, I don't, I didn't fuck with IPAs for a while.
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:26.820]   And then during the pandemic, I got it.
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:27.820]   I got back into IPAs.
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:28.820]   I was that way with Jack and Coke, Jack Daniels and Coke.
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:29.820]   Really?
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:30.820]   Got so drunk many, many years ago that just couldn't look at it for a few years.
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:31.820]   I can't touch, I can't touch, uh, uh, what's Janis Joplin's drink?
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:32.820]   Southern Comfort.
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:33.820]   I can't touch Southern Comfort.
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:34.820]   She's just drinking straight?
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:35.820]   Uh, well, I, it was.
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:36.820]   But Southern Comfort is a drink that I drink every day.
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:37.820]   I can't touch it.
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:38.820]   I can't touch it.
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:39.820]   I can't touch it.
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:43.580]   that just couldn't look at it for a few years.
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:44.400]   I can't touch.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:48.240]   What's Janis Joplin's drink?
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.280]   Southern Comfort.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.460]   I can't touch Southern Comfort.
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:51.400]   She just drank it straight?
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.600]   Southern Comfort is at 40%.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.140]   That's hard.
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:55.760]   No, it's almost like a liqueur.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.300]   Honestly, it's really sweet.
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:00.860]   Jack, double Jack on the rocks, lots of rocks.
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:04.400]   I had a quote that I got a video that went viral about
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.560]   I'll never quit drinking.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.500]   And I have not gotten on a plane since that
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.980]   without having a flight attendant not even ask what I want.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:14.640]   Walk up with a double Jack on the rocks, lots of rocks.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.680]   I mean, it happens.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.860]   So on times I don't want to drink.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.920]   I flew to Austin the other day.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:20.620]   I was like, I'm not drinking.
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.540]   On the plane, because I felt sick.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:25.860]   And man, he walked up and he goes,
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:27.220]   double Jack on the rocks, lots of rocks.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:28.380]   I was like, fuck, you know it.
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.660]   But yeah, that's my drink.
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:33.800]   Wait, what's your drink?
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.220]   I thought you'd be a vodka guy.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:39.060]   Well, vodka.
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:42.500]   I associate with a lot of moments in my life of happiness
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:46.300]   because vodka is associated with shots and camaraderie.
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:49.240]   And there's Eastern Europe in general.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:54.920]   A bunch of guys get together and you celebrate life intensely.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.300]   People fight.
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:58.480]   People just feel.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.000]   People experience life in a deep way.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.060]   You just get too drunk for a reason.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:08.780]   But I don't see that as like drinking, drinking.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:12.720]   That's like a journey towards a destination.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:17.640]   It's like, to me, drinking is like whiskey neat or beer.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:18.740]   Like you said, ice cold beer.
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.560]   There's that afternoon beer.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.540]   Like for a person like me who's extremely regimented and disciplined,
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.360]   sometimes you get the situation.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.300]   I just remember, I mean, just, I remember there's a bar at MIT
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:33.380]   where I just remember in the afternoon,
[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:34.620]   there was like a business meeting.
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:36.920]   I sat down, we started with a beer
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.740]   and they were like really crisply,
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.320]   really cold, some kind of lager.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.700]   And then just one beer and two beers.
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.340]   And all of a sudden you say, fuck it.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:49.660]   Let's just, the rest of the day, this is what this is.
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:52.060]   And you said bright, like you just,
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:54.460]   life and nature is beautiful out there.
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:57.180]   And you just said, fuck it to all the meetings.
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.740]   Fuck it to everything else.
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:03.460]   Just the camaraderie, the just talking about life,
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.480]   being silly, being, you know, all of that.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.340]   See that, see, you're describing something I'll never get.
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:09.700]   Cause I'm not regimented.
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:15.340]   I would love, I would love, I would love only for the moment
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:18.540]   that you get to have, you get the most precious little angel's
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:22.380]   breath that anyone's going to get because you live this life
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.500]   that's dialed in and it's scheduled.
[01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:29.080]   And so when you say fuck it, it's like, that's like me doing Coke.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.580]   Like it's like, oh fuck it.
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:33.160]   And you can just do that with beer.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.660]   That is fucking amazing.
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:38.500]   I would love to live a regimented life.
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:43.720]   Just to get the chance to go, Hey guys, I'm not performing surgery today.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.680]   Fuck it.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:49.960]   Hey guys, this, this bus full of kids, kids got to, it's got to drive itself home.
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.520]   Fuck it.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:56.000]   I couldn't even, I couldn't even tell you, you know, so interesting about me and
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.740]   you as you know, I'm a fan of yours.
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:04.300]   I couldn't even, I don't really know what AI is like other than like dildos or AI.
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:04.560]   Right?
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:04.960]   Like,
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.380]   like if it has some electronics in it.
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:12.700]   No, I don't think a dildo classifies as a robot.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:15.460]   Cause I thought that's how they were going to take over fucking mankind.
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:20.080]   Just well, they start with these, the fucking womanizer that knows how to eat a pussy.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.580]   And then they're like, we don't need men anymore.
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:26.980]   But like, it's so interesting that I couldn't even like, I can barely tell you what my dad does for a living.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:27.580]   He's a lawyer.
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:31.120]   I could kind of like, he's called me and say, Hey man, you gotta stop talking about what I do.
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.200]   Cause you're not doing it right.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.400]   I go, what do you mean?
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.900]   He's like, that's not whatever you're saying I do.
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:35.400]   I don't do.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.960]   And so.
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:41.980]   But like, I couldn't even begin to explain your job to my daughter.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:47.700]   Well, I think there's the way you do the job, which is the way you experience life.
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:51.380]   The regimented, just even just a nine to five job, right?
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.660]   You do work nine to five.
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:55.360]   No, but I work much more than that.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:00.640]   But there's no, every kind of lifestyle has its complexities.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.300]   I think nine to five means you have to wake up at a certain time every day.
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.660]   Do people tell you to pull it back and then like, Hey, you're working too hard.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:08.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:14.440]   A lot of people, what I want in my life, what I love in my life, especially people close to me are the ones that say work harder.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.780]   Cause everybody, how do you get them?
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:17.980]   How do you get them?
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:19.520]   I don't have anyone in my life that does that.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.460]   Everybody's always worried about me.
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.400]   Everyone's worried about me.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.140]   Everyone's always worried about me.
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:31.900]   The only thing no one ever says, if I showed you my DMS right now, my, my texts, all it is, is like, Hey man, I'm worried about you.
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:32.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.580]   Like Joe, I loved you to death.
[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:38.020]   Not once has he, he always, I don't know.
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:42.160]   If you've seen the caring Joe eyes where like, I'm worried about you where it's like,
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.900]   and you're like, Hey man, don't do that.
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:47.920]   And he's like, I'm worried about you.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.900]   And you're like, don't fucking worry about me.
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:50.520]   I'm working.
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.640]   It's I'm just working.
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.760]   I love working.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:53.820]   I love what I do.
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:55.420]   I love what I do.
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:28:00.700]   I can only imagine that you love what you do as much as I love what I do, because that's all I ever want to think about.
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:01.720]   It's all I ever want to talk about.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:07.960]   It's all I ever want to be like, I, I, I, when, when my wife wants me to take, uh, August and.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.200]   Whatever the, August, whatever the fucking month is.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:11.680]   September?
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.000]   That's, goes after August.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.820]   No, but like July and August off after we do fully loaded.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:20.260]   And I was like, no, I was like, what do you mean?
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:23.620]   Like, so like, well, I'll just, am I gonna like sit in a chair and stuff?
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.780]   She's like, no, you can do like, take up a hobby.
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:27.340]   I go writing jokes.
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.720]   Can I get on stage?
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.980]   Can I do sets in the city?
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:37.060]   Cause I'm not gonna fucking, do you want me to like, like, I don't understand what I don't understand people who don't, I don't understand people who don't have the drive to work.
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:38.260]   All the time.
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:39.380]   I don't understand that.
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:40.120]   I envy it.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:40.660]   I envy it.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:44.380]   Cause I go, I would love to just be like, I'm gonna play video games.
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.460]   I can't play a video game.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:48.100]   If I did, I'd be on Twitch trying to make money.
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:52.060]   Like I love, how do you find someone who goes, you need to work harder.
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:52.900]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:59.200]   Especially when they see like, I, I don't know what you look like, but I, I look tormented when I'm working very hard.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:04.060]   Like it means like, it's easy to worry for my wellbeing.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:07.660]   It's not like I'm happy go lucky, but I'm happy underneath.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:25.080]   My working too hard is like on a plane every other day or every day, getting up at six, working out and then going until like two in the morning or one in the morning and then going to sleep and then getting up at six, working out, getting on a plane, going to another place.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.360]   Like, that's what my working is just a lot of travel in mind.
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:31.480]   If I didn't drink on planes, I don't think anyone would probably worry about me at all.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:32.560]   They'd be like, no, you're doing great.
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.040]   But the working out is there.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:37.640]   So I gotta ask you, cause you and I seem to have a similar relationship with running.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.640]   I like this idea of a slow treadmill.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.900]   I like running slow.
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:46.420]   You know, like a 10 minute mile or something like this.
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:48.040]   So I'll just run forever.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.640]   Just listen to an audio book, listen to Brown noise.
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.640]   Think.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.940]   I love it.
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:54.020]   What's Brown noise.
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:58.180]   It's actually Brownian noise, but short Brown noise.
[01:29:58.180 --> 01:29:59.560]   It's kind of like white noise, but deeper.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:02.640]   So it's just noise like that.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:04.080]   Oh, wow.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.640]   It's kind of sounds like a waterfall.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.820]   And I'll just listen to it.
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:07.620]   And something happens.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:10.280]   I think there's, you can ask Huberman about this.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:14.160]   I don't, but apparently there's some science that kind of focuses the mind and so on.
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.500]   It's funny.
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:21.240]   Cause I think sometimes when people don't get about running is they go, they get on
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:25.180]   and they put it on like a six right away on like a treadmill and they go, I can't do this
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:30.680]   for fucking 30 minutes, but you can, if you build yourself up to your six and you play
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.300]   games, I play games with myself a lot.
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:36.680]   Like I'll play games where I go, um, and I can do this.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.240]   I can do this.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.540]   I can do this almost not all day long, but I can do this a lot longer.
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:49.420]   Like I did it for two hours the other day before my workout or no hour and a half before my workout, where I started a 3.5 walking.
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:54.820]   And then I, and then I get my jog up to like a five and then I'm like 5.5.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:56.060]   Then I go six and then I go.
[01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:58.380]   And once I'm at a six, my body's really loose.
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:00.880]   And so then I'll go, all right, bring it down to a 3.5.
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.460]   And then I go punch it to a 7.5 for a quarter of a mile.
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:05.620]   And then let's walk at a four.
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:06.700]   Let's jog at a five.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:06.940]   Right.
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.480]   I can do that.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.240]   I love they're called, uh, fartlets, I think.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:16.900]   And I love those like where it's like, it's regimented running
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:18.580]   and sprinting at certain levels.
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:19.160]   I love that.
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:23.840]   And I love also when I work out to listen to music, but put on foreign
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.740]   language cooking shows on Netflix.
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:27.140]   Can you explain that?
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:28.820]   They just put it on mute.
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:30.240]   You don't need to hear it for some reason.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.640]   They're sexier the way they're shot.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:32.340]   They're sexier.
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:37.160]   And it's like street food, Asia, and they're just watching them make street food in Asia.
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:37.460]   There's.
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:37.560]   One.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.280]   Called broth.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.320]   It's called broth, the nation of broth.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:44.120]   And they're just making broths and you're like, fuck, I want some broth.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.480]   So this is South America.
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:46.080]   This is Asia.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.320]   South America, Asia.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:50.220]   Um, they do one on pizzas.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:53.180]   I've watched this one on pizzas that I've watched it.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.860]   There's like four episodes.
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:59.520]   I've watched every episode so many times that my trainer goes, God, that's that fucking,
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.720]   I would, I could watch that again.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:06.320]   Um, I love watching foreign language cooking shows on mute when I work out
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.440]   while blasting music.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.160]   While blasting hip.
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:08.660]   She's there.
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:11.520]   All right.
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.320]   Well, I usually run outside, but I do the same kind of thing.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.440]   I don't mind hiking.
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:19.020]   And I like, I do like, you know what my fun thing, the fun thing I would do, and this
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:26.500]   is a, this is ripped off totally from campaigns is I like to go, uh, there's a great hike
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.860]   called Fryman Canyon out in the valley where I live.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:32.100]   And I'd be like, all right, I'm going to run to frame from a Canyon.
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:33.480]   I'm going to jog to Fryman Canyon.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.680]   I'm going to hike Fryman Canyon.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:35.700]   And then I'm going to jog back.
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:36.200]   Mm-hmm.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:36.600]   Okay.
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:36.940]   Yeah.
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:37.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.540]   And then I wonder how long that is.
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:41.040]   And I go, don't think about it.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.360]   Just know that that's your thing.
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:43.760]   Just know that that's your thing.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.280]   And then all of a sudden you're like, shit, that was eight miles.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:48.000]   You're like, that's a fucking beast.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.160]   The hike doesn't even feel like anything.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:50.520]   The hike.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:55.760]   Once you do the jogs, the hard part there, the jog home is a fucking cakewalk.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.320]   I had the best job when I was in Serbia.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.820]   I had the best job.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.260]   I think it was in Hyde park.
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:02.820]   I think the name of the park's Hyde park.
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:04.480]   Mm-hmm it was get this.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.720]   It was 80% downhill.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.040]   Wow.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:12.300]   So this jog, you started the park and it was like, and I'll do it like this for you.
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:18.240]   You went like downhill like this, downhill like this, downhill like this.
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:22.060]   And then it was like a little steep incline to get to the beginning of it.
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:26.640]   So it was like a little like nice, like lower back pain and you're like, okay, okay.
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.440]   And then the jog was perfect.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:28.960]   Mm-hmm.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:29.700]   And you did it four times.
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.480]   It was four miles.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.080]   I loved it.
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:34.980]   My very first day I did it, a butterfly got in front of me.
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:36.080]   It's like six in the morning.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.840]   Six in the morning and a butterfly got in front of me and it ran the whole first mile
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:41.840]   in front of me.
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.320]   And I just, it was like so surreal.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.580]   It would disappear and then it would show back up in front of me.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:47.580]   You sure it was real?
[01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:48.580]   Definitely real.
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:50.620]   And then the next day, and so I go, I'm on the right path.
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:51.880]   I'm on the right path.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.320]   The next day I go for a jog, six in the morning and it rained.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:59.680]   And as I'm doing this steep uphill incline, a tree collapsed in front of me.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.960]   Just went, and I went, whoa, a tree fell in the woods and I was here to see it.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:05.960]   Shut the fuck up.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:06.960]   I was like, that's crazy.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:07.960]   And it didn't hit me.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:08.960]   I go, I'm on the right path.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:10.840]   And then I started getting over thinking it.
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.460]   Like the next day I saw a condom and I was like, this is a good place to enjoy.
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:15.080]   I was like, people fucked here last night.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.520]   But yeah, that was one of the best jogs I've ever had.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.520]   I could do that.
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.520]   I could run that park every single day.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.520]   No one jogged that park in Serbia.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:29.600]   I actually recently had a condom on my doorstep and I wanted to ask whoever is up there above
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:36.840]   what that means, what the story behind that is.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:37.840]   I was like, I don't know.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:38.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:39.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:40.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.

[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:48.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:49.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:50.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:51.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:52.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:53.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:54.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:55.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:56.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:57.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:58.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:53:59.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:00.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:01.840]   I'm just gonna go and check.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:04.240]   I remember listening to that podcast where you really made the pitch.
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:07.200]   Yeah, and I said, "We all take hip-hop dance lessons.
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.460]   Your cardio's through the roof.
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:13.560]   You do an hour dance lesson, then we all do a hip-hop dance, and then we all put our hip-top
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:16.680]   dances against each other, and we see who has the best hip-hop dance."
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:19.240]   It's different than the typical stuff we do.
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:20.700]   It's fun, and we can also work out.
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:23.320]   We can do everything, but let's do hip-hop dance.
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:26.060]   And Joe adamantly was like, "That's a horrible idea.
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:27.580]   I will not do that."
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:31.640]   And then Tom and Ari just whatever, they were like, "Yeah, I side with Joe.
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:32.640]   We'll do something else."
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:35.400]   And then I was like, but I knew I liked hip-hop dance.
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:37.880]   And so I was like, "I'm gonna take hip-hop dance lessons anyway.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:41.820]   I'm gonna just do it over Sober October, and I'm just gonna fucking do it.
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:46.600]   And then maybe I'll do a hip-hop dance video, and then show it to them and let them rate
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.600]   me."
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:54.660]   And then we did it, and it was $1,200 for hip-hop dance lessons for a month or whatever,
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:56.840]   for a couple weeks.
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:01.440]   And then when we did it, I thought, "You know what, I bet we could put tour dates next
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.440]   to this."
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:05.680]   Because it turned out being kind of good, but kind of funny.
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:08.120]   I go, "I bet we could put tour dates next to this."
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.680]   And it was the beginning of me figuring out the whole...
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.680]   My promos were short and quick, and they were always something silly.
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:15.680]   "What's up, guys?
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:17.660]   It's your boy, Burt Kreischer."
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:22.380]   And then that one blew up, and immediately I was announcing the tour, and immediately
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:24.060]   every tour date sold out.
[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:25.060]   And then every...
[01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:29.480]   We added shows that day, we added shows, and every one of those sold out.
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:30.480]   And I was like, "Whoa."
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:31.240]   And then Tom was like...
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:32.240]   "What the fuck was that?"
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:39.800]   And I was like, "I think I just sold out my whole fucking tour."
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:45.000]   And then when Tom did his one like that and put his tour dates on it...
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000]   Yeah, went over the top.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.040]   He sold out his tours.
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:49.040]   And he was like, "Whoa."
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:51.000]   He's like, "Dude, I sold out every fucking show.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000]   We've added shows.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.280]   I'm doing an arena here."
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.800]   And this is before we were doing arenas.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:56.400]   I was like, "Shut the fuck up."
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:01.040]   And that changed my game where I was like, "All right, so everything's gotta be..."
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:03.220]   And then I was like, "I don't mind spending a little money."
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:06.160]   And then the next one I did was the marching band.
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:07.160]   And I was just like...
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.400]   But it was real crazy.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:11.680]   I just said, "Can you guys get me a marching band?"
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:13.800]   And they were like, "Yeah, it's like 2,400 bucks."
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:14.800]   I go, "Cool."
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:15.800]   And they're like, "What do you want them to do?"
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:16.800]   And I go, "I don't know.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:17.800]   We'll figure it out."
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:21.840]   And they came over and they had outfits and they were like, "So what do you want us to
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.840]   play?"
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:23.840]   I go, "What song do you guys know?"
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:25.140]   And then they didn't even know each other.
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:26.140]   They were all hired people.
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:28.760]   And they were like, "Rubber Band Man?"
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:29.840]   And I was like, "Oh, sure.
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:30.840]   Yeah."
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:31.840]   And then we just scripted it out.
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:34.580]   I was like, "All right, I'll pretend it's a regular thing, listen, wait.
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:36.500]   I'll walk out and then I'll blow a whistle.
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:39.980]   And then you come out with the..."
[01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:43.940]   And then we got two videos out of that and that sold out dates.
[01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:47.680]   And then I was like, "Fuck."
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:57.580]   And then the real baller one, the fucking real one, the real one was I tore all the
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:00.640]   muscles in my arm going into shooting the movie.
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:03.400]   And I ripped all the tricep muscles off and they were retracted.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:06.140]   So I had to go in for surgery.
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:11.480]   And the anesthesiologist said to me the night before, he's like, "What music do you want
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:12.480]   going under?"
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:13.480]   And I was like, "What?"
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:14.480]   And he goes, "You can pick your music going under."
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:16.520]   I said, "Wait, hold on.
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:17.520]   Is it like..."
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:18.520]   I go, "Is it like casual?"
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:19.520]   And he was like, "Yeah."
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:22.020]   I said, "I'm doing a promo read going under."
[01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:23.020]   He goes, "What do you mean?"
[01:57:23.020 --> 01:57:27.020]   I said, "I'll explain it to you tomorrow, but I'm not gonna count backwards.
[01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:29.640]   I'm just gonna do a promo read until I pass out."
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:30.640]   Mm-hmm.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:31.640]   And I fall on the ground.
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:34.640]   All I need you to do is hit stop record.
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:35.640]   Mm-hmm.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:38.140]   And so they rolled me into surgery.
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:39.140]   I had Red Rocks.
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:43.660]   I had only sold like 75% of Red Rocks, which is the biggest, 10,000, the biggest venue
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:45.440]   I'd ever played in.
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:49.940]   And I rolled in with my thing with CCR playing in the background.
[01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:54.920]   And I just was like, as I lay here on this mat or on this steel pile, I was terrified
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:59.940]   as I go into surgery, I want you to know one thing, I'm playing Red Rocks September 10th.
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:00.440]   And then I started doing my promo read.
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:01.440]   And he was like, "Yeah."
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:03.440]   I go, "Jimmy Buffett's there the night before and the night after."
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:04.440]   He's like, "For real?"
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.440]   I go, "Yeah, you wanna come?"
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:06.440]   He's like, "Hell yeah."
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:07.440]   He's like, "All right."
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.440]   He's like, "You're going under."
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:09.440]   And he hits it.
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:10.440]   I go, "Oh, sure."
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:11.440]   And I dropped the phone.
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:13.440]   I woke up out of surgery.
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:15.440]   And the first thing I said is, "Where's my phone?"
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:16.440]   And he goes, "You got it."
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:18.440]   And Leigh-Anne's like, "I've already watched it.
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:19.440]   It's good."
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:20.440]   And I went, "For real?"
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:21.440]   Nice.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:24.440]   And so that was a big one.
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.440]   That was a big one too.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.440]   Yeah, that was genius.
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:29.440]   But that was sort of opportunity kind of jumping on an idea.
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:31.440]   Have you ever met Mr. Beast, Jimmy?
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:32.440]   No.
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.440]   So I got to hang out with him for a day, listen to him brainstorm with the team ideas.
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:43.440]   He kind of sounds like you, but on steroids in terms of like, first of all, willing to
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:46.440]   spend any amount of money on an idea.
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:47.440]   Like anything.
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:49.440]   Anything is allowed.
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.440]   Anything is allowed.
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:51.440]   I love that energy.
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:55.440]   The only thing is no like rated R stuff.
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:56.240]   So he's really...
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:59:00.840]   He's really trying to go like for the broader audience, for kids and so on.
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:01.840]   So that's the limitation.
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:02.840]   So you can't do...
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:07.840]   Like most of the ideas that pop into my head when anything is allowed is kind of dark.
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:13.140]   But the point is to really aggressively brainstorm every single day at the whiteboard.
[01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:14.140]   Like what...
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:17.840]   And he does that for YouTube Shorts too, for one minute videos.
[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:18.840]   Really?
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:22.540]   And just like really, like what is the coolest thing we could possibly do?
[01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:23.540]   I love that.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:24.540]   I love that energy.
[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:26.040]   And that energy...
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:27.040]   That energy is the biggest thing.
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:29.040]   It's the best thing.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.040]   I mean, most people don't do that and they should.
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:32.940]   Basically YouTubers do that because they're obsessed about this particular YouTube algorithm
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:33.940]   and so on.
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:35.940]   And Jimmy is the best at that.
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:39.940]   But like that can benefit you if you're a scientist, if you're a comedian, if you're
[01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:40.940]   whatever.
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:41.940]   Just go all out.
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:47.940]   There's something really fun, authentically fun about just coming up with a really stupid
[01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:49.940]   idea and just going, let's see what happens.
[01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:50.940]   Who gives a fuck?
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:51.940]   We've had those like...
[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:53.840]   I thought I could catch an arrow one time.
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:54.840]   And...
[01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:59.740]   And my wife's like, "Absolutely fucking not."
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:00.740]   And I go, "I really think I can."
[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:05.740]   I go, "Let's just get really close, shoot it, and then I'll see if I can catch it."
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:07.740]   And she's like, "No, that's not what you're doing."
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:10.740]   And then my cousin's like, "Hey, we could cheat it to make you look like you caught
[02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:11.740]   an arrow."
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:12.740]   And I went, "What?"
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:13.740]   He goes, "Yeah, just...
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:14.740]   Okay, let's do it like this."
[02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:15.740]   And so we did it.
[02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:16.740]   And it got sold a ton of tickets.
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:17.740]   It looked like I really caught it.
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:18.740]   Everyone knows I didn't catch an arrow.
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:21.740]   I mean, for the movie, we did a promo.
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:22.740]   Legendary was like, "You do all the promos."
[02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:23.740]   And we did a promo and I thought I could slide out of the movie.
[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:28.920]   And we did a promo and I thought I could slide out of my car like Tom Cruise did in
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:34.500]   a helicopter and with roller skates and get behind the car and then skate behind the car.
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:37.020]   And we just ran over my foot.
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:41.460]   And it was real and it was scary, but we just caught it all.
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:44.860]   And in doing it, my cousin's like, "Give me the read."
[02:00:44.860 --> 02:00:48.640]   And I'm like, "Duh, my movie comes out Memorial Day weekend.
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:49.640]   I think we have to go to the hospital."
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:53.240]   And then we went to the hospital and I'm in the Speedo with a helmet on, one broken roller
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:53.540]   skate.
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:56.580]   And then that did really well.
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:59.540]   And so, the whole thing is just turn the camera on.
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:02.200]   You never know what's going to fucking happen.
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.440]   And don't be afraid to look stupid and all that kind of stuff.
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:05.440]   Just go all out.
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:08.140]   Fucking ego is the death of comedy.
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:11.660]   When you really give a...
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:15.900]   It's hard to be the coolest guy in the room and still want to be a comedian.
[02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:17.500]   It's just let yourself be whoever you are.
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:23.340]   And you'll see the great ones, they're like that.
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:24.340]   They're the fucking dudes.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:25.340]   And you get some real slick ones.
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:27.660]   Dave's probably might be the coolest guy in the fucking room.
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:28.660]   He really might be.
[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:30.820]   But I think that's just who the fuck he is.
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:32.780]   Who are the...
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:35.820]   Outside your close friend group, who are the greats to you?
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:36.820]   Top five.
[02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:39.400]   Outside of my friend group?
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:47.340]   So for me, probably Norm Macdonald, Mitch Heidberg, George Carlin, Tom Segura, number
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:48.340]   one.
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:49.340]   Oh yeah?
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:50.340]   No.
[02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:51.140]   I wanted to say that.
[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:53.140]   It's an interesting pairing.
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:56.140]   No, Mitch Heidberg, Dave Attell.
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:57.140]   Dave Attell.
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:58.140]   Dave Attell.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:00.780]   Everybody deeply respects Dave Attell.
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:03.940]   More than even his comedy, I love the show where he was...
[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:04.940]   Insomniac.
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:05.940]   Insomniac.
[02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:10.720]   He's so good at just the natural comedy of human interaction.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:12.060]   He's a brilliant comic.
[02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:13.820]   He's just a brilliant fucking mind.
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:17.980]   Norm Macdonald's a fucking genius, an absolute genius.
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:20.440]   I mean, look.
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.940]   Chappelle and Bill Burr are the two best comedians.
[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:25.700]   Two best in our generation, in my opinion.
[02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:30.880]   And that's understanding that I'm still friends with some of the best in our generation, but
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:34.640]   just the way their brains work is really on the next level.
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:35.640]   Those are guys...
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:37.000]   Stan Hope is the same way.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.000]   Just fucking genius.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.100]   Rogan, Segura, those are my friend group.
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:42.580]   That's my really close friend group.
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:45.740]   But those other guys I'm friends with, but they're not...
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:46.740]   That's like...
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:47.740]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:48.740]   Louis C.K.
[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:49.740]   Oh, Louis C.K.
[02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:50.740]   Fuck.
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:51.740]   He's amazing.
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:52.740]   It's hard to do because you start...
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:57.140]   It's like forgetting people and then it's almost like people go, "Oh, so you didn't like
[02:02:57.140 --> 02:02:58.140]   that person?"
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:02:59.140]   You're like, "No, I fucking love that person."
[02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:00.140]   Yeah.
[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:01.140]   Yeah.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.140]   I mean, there's...
[02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:04.840]   For me, Robin Williams was a whole nother thing.
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:05.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:08.500]   Sarah Silverman, fucking...
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.500]   I love Janine.
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:12.500]   I'm a fucking big Janine fan.
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:13.500]   I love her brain.
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:16.620]   Marin's fucking hilarious.
[02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:17.620]   Patton's brilliant.
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:18.620]   David Cross.
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:19.620]   I mean, there's like...
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:20.620]   It's really...
[02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:22.540]   To ignore those guys, and those guys were like the whole forefront of...
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:23.540]   Yeah.
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:24.540]   ...the alternative comedy front.
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:25.540]   They're fucking amazing.
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:26.540]   Yeah.
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:30.540]   And the people that have like Marin or Joe that have podcasts, it's interesting.
[02:03:30.540 --> 02:03:34.180]   It's an interesting pairing because you get to know everything about them, but then they're
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:35.180]   also comedians.
[02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:39.540]   And I've gone to Joe's club a lot.
[02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:45.040]   Listen, Joe and just that whole group of comics do comedy and go to the same set over and
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:46.340]   over and over to see how it changes.
[02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:47.340]   It's really cool to...
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:48.340]   It's the coolest thing.
[02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:49.340]   When I first started to watch...
[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:52.340]   Someone like Attell was really brilliant at it because you'd watch him tinker with a
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:53.340]   set.
[02:03:53.340 --> 02:03:54.340]   Yeah.
[02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:59.340]   And he'd have an idea like hitting someone over the head with a hammer from behind, and
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:03.580]   then he'd work it nine different ways, and you'd be like, "Whoa."
[02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:06.940]   So the hitting hammer in the head is the thing that he's working on.
[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:10.680]   I hope Eddie Murphy comes back.
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:11.680]   He's one of the greats.
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:12.680]   Chris Rock.
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:13.680]   Chris Rock's fucking...
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:17.340]   "Bring the Pain" is like the reason I got into comedy.
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:18.340]   Yeah.
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:20.340]   Do you have advice for young folks?
[02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:21.340]   You seem like a stellar guy.
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:27.340]   I'm not going to be a stellar example of a successful human being, or more seriously,
[02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:29.340]   a very non-linear life.
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:32.340]   Do you have advice for young people in high school and college?
[02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:37.340]   How to have a good life they can be proud of?
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:45.340]   Don't worry too much about what you do when you get older, but when you do start worrying,
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:49.340]   find the thing you love and it'll never feel like work.
[02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:51.140]   To fucking...
[02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:56.200]   I can't imagine what it must feel like to be a lawyer and have to read papers or whatever
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:59.140]   they do all day and know that that's my day.
[02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:00.140]   Yeah.
[02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:04.140]   It must feel like what school felt like for me.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:11.140]   If you find that thing you love to do, you will work endlessly, effortlessly, and hard
[02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:15.140]   as fucking shit every day, and you'll love every day of your life.
[02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:17.140]   Find what you love and let it kill you.
[02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:18.140]   Bukowski said that.
[02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:19.140]   Then that's the fucking thing, because that's what I'm doing.
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:20.140]   Yeah.
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:24.140]   I'm on that fucking bullet train to fucking nowhere on this fucking comedy journey.
[02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:25.140]   I love it.
[02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:26.140]   I love it.
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:29.140]   It's like the Hunter S. Thompson thing, however you put it.
[02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:37.140]   Basically, you're not supposed to end up in a well-preserved box.
[02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:39.140]   You slide in sideways, smoke, just beat up.
[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:40.140]   Yeah.
[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:41.140]   Just a giant mess.
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:45.140]   I love those guys that can really live that life that are like, "Oh, I'm gonna go to prison.
[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:46.140]   I'm gonna go to jail."
[02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:47.140]   I don't want to live that life.
[02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:48.140]   I want to live that life.
[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:49.140]   I want to live it.
[02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:51.140]   I want to live that life that are like, "Yeah, man.
[02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:52.140]   I'm breaking it.
[02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:53.140]   I'm breaking it down."
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:55.820]   Like a guy like Tony Hawk or Matt Hoffman, who's like, "Yeah.
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:59.140]   If I don't fucking break the fuck out of this thing before I ... Then I'm not doing it right."
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:03.140]   Then again, there's also Churchill, who tried to break the thing and he couldn't.
[02:06:03.140 --> 02:06:06.140]   Lived into his 90s, a bad motherfucker.
[02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:08.140]   Just a bad motherfucker.
[02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:12.140]   I guess the only hope we can have for Bert Kreischer is that you're gonna be the Winston
[02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:13.140]   Churchill of comedy.
[02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:18.140]   My life is lived perfectly if I'm 95 years old.
[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:21.140]   I'm 95 years old and all my friends are dead.
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:22.140]   Yeah.
[02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:23.140]   Yeah.
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:24.140]   Yeah.
[02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:28.140]   They're like, "Can you believe that wolf got Rogan?"
[02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:29.140]   Yeah.
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:35.140]   "Can you believe Segura, 600 pounds, and they had to carry him out in a crane out of that
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:36.140]   house?
[02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:41.140]   Can you believe that it's just Bert Kreischer and Joey Diaz left?"
[02:06:41.140 --> 02:06:44.140]   Just standing there in October.
[02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:47.140]   Super October, just the two of you left.
[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:48.140]   Just laughing.
[02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:53.140]   Super October is just ... I'm 95 at the Mark Twain Awards and they're like, "Bert Kreischer
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:54.140]   still fucking here.
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:55.140]   Who saw that coming?"
[02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.140]   I hope so.
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:57.140]   Bert, I'm a huge fan of yours.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:58.140]   It meant so much to me when you said that you knew who I was, like we were talking about.
[02:06:58.140 --> 02:06:59.140]   It's so cool.
[02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:00.140]   It's so cool.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:01.140]   Thank you for putting so much joy and love out there in the world.
[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:02.140]   I'm a huge fan.
[02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:03.140]   And thank you for the love you've given me.
[02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:04.140]   Thank you, man.
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:05.140]   I am a huge fan of yours.
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:06.140]   You keep doing you.
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:07.140]   I'll keep doing me.
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:08.140]   And then let's see what happens next.
[02:07:08.140 --> 02:07:09.140]   I'm gonna be a big fan of yours.
