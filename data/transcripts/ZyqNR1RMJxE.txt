[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   Thomas Frank is this huge YouTuber, two and a half million
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.120]   subscribers, the way he motivated himself to publish
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.120]   videos in the early days of his channel, when no one was
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.760]   watching was an app called a beeminder, which is an automatic
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.880]   thing where it would it like connects to your YouTube RSS
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.160]   feed. And if you don't publish a video every week, it will take
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.920]   $30 out of your debit card or out of your bank account just
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.800]   completely automatically. And that was how he made himself
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.360]   accountable. He's like, Well, I've got to publish a video
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.080]   every week. Otherwise, I'm losing $30. Now, depending on
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.760]   who you are $30 might not seem like enough money, but it needs
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.120]   to be enough money to sting. So one thing that I've actually
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.840]   tried in the past is giving my housemate 1000 pounds and
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.160]   saying, if I don't do this thing, you get to keep the
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.360]   1000 pounds. And that just worked magically for me to do
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.680]   absolutely anything. I don't like using it all the time. I'd
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.360]   much rather use all these other nicer methods. But that is a
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.120]   failsafe. If I'm ever really struggling to do a thing that I
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.960]   know I have to do, like write 1000 pounds transfer the money
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.960]   and they can always give it back to me once once I've done the
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.120]   thing. Hello, and welcome to another episode of all the hacks
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.880]   show about upgrading your life, money and travel. I'm Chris
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.880]   Hutchins. I'm excited you're here today. So imagine this,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.400]   you're a smart kid, your family prioritizes education, you study
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.200]   hard and you decide you want to become a doctor. You ace your
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.680]   exams, you're admitted to one of the top medical schools in the
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.960]   world, you complete the program and you start work. And then a
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.880]   few years later, you decide to leave it all behind to focus on
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.760]   something else. At first glance, many of you might think that's
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.800]   crazy. But it's exactly what my guest today, Ali Abdaal did. He
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.880]   left the practice of medicine a few years ago to focus on his
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880]   exploding and growing YouTube channel and the businesses
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.120]   surround it, which now has more than 3 million subscribers. On
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.640]   it. He talks about everything from productivity to study
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.400]   skills to making an impact and so much more. If that's not
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.520]   enough, he has two podcasts has two courses, a blog and a
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.400]   newsletter. I've consumed so much of Ali's content that I'm
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.520]   a such a huge fan of his work. So I'm really excited to talk
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.640]   about everything from how he got the courage to quit a successful
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.160]   career to double down on his passion and build a business
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.600]   around it. A lesson I might need in the near future. I also want
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.640]   to spend a good part of the conversation digging into the
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.080]   strategies, the tools, the hacks he uses to live a happier,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.480]   healthier and more productive life. He's a true expert here.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.040]   He's dialed in when it comes to productivity, reading
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.400]   efficiently, the tech and the tools he uses and a lot more.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.320]   This is going to be a really great conversation. I also want
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.240]   to get his take on a few things I'm thinking about doing with
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.120]   all the hacks. And because I know he believes in having a
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.680]   lasting impact in the world. I want to hear how he thinks we
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.280]   can all work towards doing that right.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.080]   Welcome to the show. Thanks for being here.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.160]   Thank you so much for having me. That's an incredible intro.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.920]   You've really done your homework. And I'm just like,
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.120]   wow, that sounds really cool when you put it that way.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.440]   Yeah, I mean, I'm excited. So I want to start off and just talk
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.360]   about your passion for teaching. You said that being able to
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.120]   teach more through your YouTube channel, your podcast, your
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.480]   courses, and have an impact that way is a big reason you step
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.280]   back for medicine. But it must have been a tough decision. So
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.040]   what can you share about that process that might help anyone,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.600]   myself included, figure out what it takes to step away and take
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.680]   a big bet on yourself?
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.320]   Yeah, okay. So a few things come to mind in no particular order.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.000]   Basically, I was always trying to figure out what the hell do I
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.960]   actually want to do with my life. And after, after a couple
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.160]   years in medicine, after kind of going through med school, I
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.280]   always kind of knew I wanted to have some level of, you know,
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.560]   streams of passive income, financial independence,
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.240]   discovered the fire movement through Tim Ferriss's interview
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.200]   with Mr. Money Mustache and got straight into that. I remember I
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.680]   was on my general practice placement when I discovered it.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.040]   And I was just like, I need to get through my patients as soon
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.600]   as possible. So I can just read more articles on Mr. Money
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.000]   Mustache. But ever since I discovered the four hour work
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.120]   week at the age of 17, just before going into med school, I
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.960]   knew that like medicine is cool, but it's not the it's not the
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.400]   only thing I want to be doing with my life seems a bit, you
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.320]   know, not very anti fragile to just be reliant on a single
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.400]   source of income. So throughout my whole time in med school, I
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.080]   always kind of knew that I wanted to dabble with like,
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.080]   maybe making a startup, maybe being interested in tech,
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.560]   because I was I knew how to code and stuff, and started a couple
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.880]   of businesses along the way. But really, like, as the YouTube
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.960]   channel started to become successful, and I really started
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.480]   to think, Okay, what do I actually want to do with my
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.320]   life, there were a couple of exercises that I discovered on
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.940]   the internet and various blogs that I found useful. The first
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.960]   one was, it didn't have a name, but like, I'm calling it the
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.240]   gravestone technique, which is figuring out like, when you die,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.000]   what do you want to be written on your gravestone? And me, I
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.280]   thought about it, and I realized some combination of good father,
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.160]   good husband, and inspirational teacher. And I was like, Oh,
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.600]   interesting. I guess that is probably Yeah, you know, if I,
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.640]   if I died, and like people thought of me as an
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.920]   inspirational teacher, alongside being a good father, a good
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.240]   husband, you're my family, that would be a life well lived. And
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.160]   I was like, Okay, cool. And then there's this other exercise I
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.960]   tried that a friend of mine who's like this business coach
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.000]   ran past me when I was like, Hey, man, Simon, like, what to
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.240]   do with my life? He was like, try this exercise. And it's
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.200]   called the ideal ordinary week, where you fast forward your
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.280]   Google Calendar five years, you hope that you don't have any
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.360]   recurring events that are still there. And you basically block
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.040]   out what does your ideal ordinary week look like? And so
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.320]   it's like, where are your time for deep work? Where's lunch?
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.640]   Where's hanging out with friends? Where's playing
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.360]   squash? Where's video games? Where's reading? I went through
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.120]   that, through that, and I looked at it, I was like, Oh, damn,
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.640]   like, there's not even a single half day here, where in my ideal
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.280]   ordinary week, I am in a hospital treating patients. And
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.480]   so those two, those two data points together, and it made me
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.640]   think, Hmm, do I read like, if I could design a life, however I
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.120]   wanted, in theory, would I choose to spend time in a
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.320]   hospital, treating patients and saving lives? The answer was
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.880]   like, I think it's great for a lot of people, but it really
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.000]   wasn't for me. And I then looked back through my time in med
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.280]   school and being a doctor, and I realized that I much and much
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.440]   preferred teaching medical students than actually doing
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.960]   medicine. And on days where I would have medical students with
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.120]   me, those would be the great days, because I'd be like, Yeah,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.400]   we can learn stuff. Let's do shit together. And days where I
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.360]   didn't, I'd be like, Oh, yes, I've got to deal with patients
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   myself. Sounds really bad to say, but that gave me a big
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.720]   signal that maybe the thing, maybe my quote calling, maybe
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.200]   the thing that I'm supposed to be doing is something to do with
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.000]   teaching rather than something to do with medicine. And so that
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.120]   was the I guess the, the philosophy behind what like led
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.320]   to me ultimately stepping back from the profession.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.440]   Yeah. So maybe one thing that an exercise that I just came up
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.200]   with thinking about your process is to look back at what you're
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.680]   doing and your job and what are the parts of it where you really
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.560]   get fulfilled. So for you, it was teaching within that role to
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.800]   younger students, like maybe there's something there. I
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.720]   interviewed Cal Newport last month, and he talked about, you
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.520]   know, trying to figure out the life you want, and then work
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.720]   backwards towards make it plan, make it happen. You know, he
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.560]   calls it lifestyle centric career planning. So is that
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.920]   something that you think, you know, kind of came naturally? Or
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.000]   is that another version of this five year calendar?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.880]   Yeah, I think it is. I was recently on a binge rereading of
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.560]   Cal's blog posts from like 2008 to 2012. I came across this kind
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.160]   of lifestyle centric career planning. And I was like, damn,
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.840]   this is basically what I did. I just didn't realize that Cal
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.560]   Newport had already said it about 10 years ago. And I
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.080]   should have just read his blog post because it would have saved
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.120]   me a lot of time. But I've I've now seen that play out in a lot
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.680]   of decisions I'm making with this business as well. It's like
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.960]   instead of thinking, I've got this thing, what do I do with
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.120]   it? It's more like, okay, what is the actual lifestyle that I
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.640]   want? And how do I then reverse engineer the stuff that I'm
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.320]   doing today to optimize for that particular lifestyle?
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.120]   And when it came to, you know, paying the bills, right? I a lot
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.000]   of times I see people encourage others, maybe not themselves to
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.560]   say, Oh, take a bet on yourself now take a bet on yourself now.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.880]   And people often might be default more towards waiting
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.600]   till their side business is so big that it's like an obvious
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.080]   decision. Is there a point where you think people should actually
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.280]   maybe wait a little longer or, you know, take the leap a little
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.240]   earlier? Or what? What have you kind of reflecting what you did?
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.160]   Think now?
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.000]   Yeah, so for me, I waited on the till the side business was like
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.600]   ridiculously huge before making the leap. But I was also in a
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.360]   career where like, after two years of working as a doctor,
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.240]   there's a very natural career break where a lot of people take
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.600]   time out. And then it makes a lot of sense to take time out at
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.080]   that point. Whereas I've got a bunch of friends who are in
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.240]   careers where it never makes sense to take time out, because
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.880]   you're always going to be worried about the gap in the
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.320]   resume and stuff. And especially my friends in management
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.520]   consulting, it's always like, Oh, the next, the next promotion,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.160]   the next round of bonuses is when I will do the thing. And
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.960]   they never end up doing the thing because it's not like a
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.400]   hard stop of like, two years later, you're out of a job. And
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.520]   now you have to reapply for the next round of residency
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.400]   specialty training or whatever. So I kind of think I had it easy
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.680]   in that the decision was made for me in that a the business
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.600]   became ridiculously successful. And B, I already had this career
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.440]   gap that I was going to take. I think if I had my time again, or
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.760]   if I were advising someone, and they were young, and actually I
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.440]   very much vibe with the Gary V approach of like, when you're
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.040]   young and unencumbered, that's when taking risks, you know, the
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.000]   whole asymmetrical upside thing, that if you start a business,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.880]   and it pays off, you are then sorted for life. Whereas, you
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.040]   know, you lose out on an extra few 10s of 1000s of dollars
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.560]   worth of earnings. And unless you really, really, really need
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.280]   that money for you and your family to survive. I think kind
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.080]   of being young and unencumbered is a great time to take risks.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.440]   You knew you wanted to teach, right? You talked about how you
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.600]   got fulfillment from that. It's not clear to me that if you were
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.280]   thinking, what am I going to take a bet on? What is it going
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.040]   to be that you knew what it would become ultimately? Is
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.560]   there are there things you learned along the way that
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.640]   helped you kind of figure out how to take, okay, I love
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.240]   teaching, and turn that into, I want a YouTube channel I want I
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.400]   here's what I actually want to teach about, you know, here the
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.200]   different mediums, whether it's a newsletter, a blog, like, how
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.160]   do you how do you go down that path? I think for some people,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.880]   for me, it was, there's this thing I was passionate about, I
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.840]   would say most of my friends almost all knew that one day I
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.960]   would be talking about, you know, optimization of life and
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.440]   travel and money and all this stuff. Everyone else knew that
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.560]   but for me, I was like, maybe I should start a podcast. And at
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.640]   first, the podcast was actually going to be about parenting
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.320]   because I was about to have my first child and I was like,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.960]   trying to dial in everything. And then slowly, I was like,
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.520]   well, maybe I don't love the parenting thing as much as the
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.200]   broader topic. But it was not natural, right? Like 10 years
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.560]   ago, people probably could have better predicted I would be
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.400]   doing this than I could have done it myself.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.680]   Yeah, I think it's kind of similar for me, it sort of felt
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.240]   like just one step in front of another. So when I was 18 years
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.720]   old, and in the summer, in the summer holidays, just before
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.240]   going to med school, I had saved up about 1000 pounds, so like
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.120]   $1200 through private tutoring here and there for three years
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.400]   and years to get a MacBook, I was like, I'm gonna get a
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.240]   MacBook for the first time in my life, I'm going to join the
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.760]   Apple ecosystem, Apple products are super expensive, but now I
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.680]   can finally afford it. And instead of buying the base
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.600]   model MacBook Air from the Apple Store, in 2012, I decided I was
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.200]   going to go on Craigslist and find one that was more specked
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.080]   out. I found some guy we met up at the station, he handed me
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.760]   this laptop, I forked over 1000 pounds in cash. And turned out
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.160]   he'd actually sold me like a four year old defunct model of
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.240]   a MacBook Air. And because I was an idiot, I kind of took his
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.000]   word for it. And I didn't I was I just sort of didn't I kind of
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   ignored all the red flags that were that were there. And I was
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.360]   like, Oh my god, I've lost all this money. It's like I spent a
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.880]   month trying to get it back and trying to try and geolocate his
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.480]   tweets to see where is he? Where can I serve him papers to take
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.720]   him to small claims court and like, sue him and stuff. And
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.560]   eventually my mom was like, you know what, screw this guy,
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.640]   you're about to start university. And she just bought
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.440]   me a new MacBook. And she was like, you know, just forget
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.360]   about this guy, which was very nice of her. But at that point,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.640]   I opened up an Evernote document, and I still got it
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   from like, August of 2012, where I said, Okay, I need to make
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.920]   money. What are the things I'm good at? And what are the things
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.960]   I enjoy doing? And on the on the list of things I was good at, I
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.400]   put teaching, I put web design, and I put, I did well in med
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.760]   school admissions exams. And I was like, sick, how do I make a
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.240]   business that involves teaching web design and med school
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.480]   entrance exams? Huh? Why don't I make a business that teaches
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.640]   courses, or med school entrance exams? And why don't I make a
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.040]   website that like markets this nationally, and undercut all the
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.680]   other competitors and make a website that just looks more pro
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.160]   than anyone else's on the market, because, you know, I
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.400]   could do that. And that was how my first kind of successful
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.840]   business started when I was at university. And then really,
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.160]   five years later, I'd sort of gotten a bit bored of that
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.080]   business. But I was reading a lot about SEO and content
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.200]   marketing. And I was like, content marketing is a thing. No
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.240]   one is really making high quality YouTube videos, teaching
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.280]   medical school admissions. So if I make videos on YouTube,
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.040]   teaching med school admissions and teaching people how to get
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.000]   a med school in the UK, maybe some of them will convert and buy
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.760]   my course or sign up to my email list. And it was like, you
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.000]   know, this sort of content marketing funnel thing that I
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.280]   had a very unsophisticated knowledge of at the time. And
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.320]   that was how the YouTube channel got started. So connecting the
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.480]   dots looking back, it feels like Yes, of course, I was going to
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.120]   do something in teaching because I've been teaching from like the
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.520]   age of seven, my job when I was 13, was involved, involved
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.920]   private tutoring, I was always teaching medical students. And
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.440]   people were always asking me to explain stuff, whether it was
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   medical stuff, or like website stuff, or like productivity
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.560]   stuff. But it was really just sort of putting one step in
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.000]   front of another and putting things together that ultimately
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.560]   led me to this point where, I guess, I guess we're here
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:38.960]   chatting.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.160]   But I mean, it wasn't an overnight success, right? You
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.640]   mentioned when you left your medical career, career, the
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.600]   channel had grown big enough that it was, you know, an easier
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.680]   decision. But you know, there are people who have successful
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.080]   followings, they start a YouTube channel, they start a podcast
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.960]   and overnight success. If I recall, you started with like
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.640]   zero followers, zero views, zero anything, and had to build it
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.760]   up. How did you stay motivated? I know that's a grueling
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.440]   process.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.240]   So yeah, I started with zero followers. I mean, I think I had
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.920]   about 37 subscribers on YouTube, just because I had a YouTube
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:16.720]   account from like 2008. So it's like 37 subscribers. Yes. The
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   way I stayed motivated was, I think, in general, I only set
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.240]   goals that are within my control. And so the goal that I
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.920]   set for my YouTube channel was like, I think this, I think this
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.440]   has potential, I think maybe this could go somewhere. But the
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.560]   only thing I'm going to think about is I just need to make one
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.120]   or two videos every week. And I'm not going to care about the
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.520]   numbers. And maybe a year from now, if I can hit, I don't know,
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.000]   a few 1000 subscribers, that would be that would be
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.360]   incredible. I looked, did a bit of market research, I was like,
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.440]   Oh, there's that person over there who's making medical
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.000]   content. And I think I can make better videos than she can. And
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.800]   she's on 4000 subscribers. So maybe if things go really well,
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   I can get 4000 subscribers. But really, the goal was just one
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.120]   foot in front of the other, how do I just make sure I bang out a
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.760]   video or two every week. And by just staying true to that
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.920]   particular thing, and not being overly wedded to outcomes that
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.160]   are outside of my control, like how many views are getting or
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.480]   how many subscribers or revenue. That's how I stayed motivated to
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.040]   do it. And along the way, just found ways to make it
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.520]   interesting for myself, I get to learn editing, I get to try this
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.680]   new transition and get to try this new thing. And let me try
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.600]   and explain this in a little bit of a different way. The goals
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.480]   that are within my control exclusively and finding a way to
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.920]   keep the process fun for myself.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.320]   Did you ever find that a video maybe did well on a topic, but
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.640]   maybe you weren't that excited about that topic and have to
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.800]   balance like what's personally exciting to you, to what's
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.360]   working and growing for your business or your brand and, you
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.240]   know, have to pick?
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.800]   Yeah, so in the early days, that was not really a consideration
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   because like, I didn't have any videos that did well. I was just
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.960]   like, cool, let's just keep going. These videos, I mean, the
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.160]   videos are doing okay, like people are viewing them, people
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.960]   are commenting, this is kind of nice, even got recognized in the
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.040]   street one time. And I was like, Oh my god, I've made it. That
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.000]   was when I had like 2000 subscribers. But it's, it's been
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.160]   really more of a thing that I've had to figure out now. Because
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.560]   now we're at a point where, you know, the channels been is five
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.600]   years old. I kind of know that if I do a video about personal
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.760]   finance, about like passive income about how I make however
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.680]   many million a year, it's going to get loads of views. And I
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.920]   know I enjoy talking about those topics. But I know that, you
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.520]   know, I often think to myself, like, okay, if we took money out
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.320]   of the equation, and if we took status out of the equation, and
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.320]   if we took the sort of the need to accumulate more and more out
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.200]   of the equation completely, what would I be doing with my time?
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.960]   What is the YouTube channel that I would want? And I always think
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.160]   Yeah, I still I still make YouTube videos, because I like
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.360]   teaching and YouTube videos of teaching at scale. And I get to
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.720]   learn cool shit and teach it to people, which is nice. But do I
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.080]   really want a channel where all the only videos I make are about
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.320]   finance or crypto because that's currently doing well? No, I want
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.840]   a channel where I can hit record and talk about anything, whether
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.640]   it's, oh my god, guys, check out Chris's podcast, it's sick, or
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.320]   like, I just read this book, it's incredible. And here's a
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.280]   summary, or here is why I use this pen pocket knife to unbox
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.120]   my parcels, like, I want to have, in my mind, I'm thinking,
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.320]   I want to have the YouTube channel that I wish Tim Ferriss
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.160]   would have, where I would just lap up anything that he posts on
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.200]   YouTube and just be like, Tim, man, I just want you to make two
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.000]   videos a week where you talk about whatever's on your mind,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.800]   and I would just watch it. And I'm like, Okay, let me have that
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.240]   kind of channel that I know I'd want to watch.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   Yeah. And is that the future of where the channel is going?
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.280]   I think so. I think my dream is where the channel is, I can make
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.920]   videos about whatever I want. And the team that I've built
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.960]   around me takes care of everything else, like the money
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.520]   side of the equation, the figuring out the funnels,
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.200]   figuring out the products, and figuring out a way to make this
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.160]   whole thing sustainable for the long term.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.240]   So I don't know if this is going to be a topic that, you know,
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.640]   fits in line with that future channel or not. But a lot of the
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.440]   top content you've made is about productivity, getting more done
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.000]   optimizing your time. It's something I'm really passionate
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.280]   about, you know, you have this great ultimate guide to
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.640]   productivity, I'll link it to the show notes, we don't need to
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.640]   cover everything. But I would love to run through some of the
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.240]   core components you think are important to someone just
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.680]   starting to say, Okay, how do I really dial in my productivity?
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.520]   And we might go a little deeper on a few things along the way.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.280]   Yeah. So like, where do you where do you start with someone
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.880]   saying, Okay, is there an inventory someone should take?
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.840]   Like, what's the first step? Because some people might
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.000]   already be at the 201 level, the 101 level? How do you get get
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.760]   people in the door thinking about productivity?
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.080]   Yeah, so I've got a bunch of different like, on like
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.440]   disorganized thoughts about this. But actually, I did a
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.000]   podcast interview with my productivity coach or
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.560]   performance coach. His name is Chris box earlier today. And he
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.760]   has a quiz on his website. It's completely free. It's called the
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.960]   performance assessment. It's on like forcing function.com
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.960]   forward slash assessment. And that's a quiz that I took two
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.480]   years ago. And it basically asks you questions like, do you have
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.600]   a vision for your life? And do you have goals? And do you look
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.880]   at those goals? And do you do weekly reviews? And in the
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.560]   morning? And do you check your email first thing? Or do you
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.760]   have like a hard stop? Do you have a bedtime routine? Do you
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.360]   have a morning routine? And based on the answers to those
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.680]   questions, it basically says, Okay, here are all of the things
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.040]   you could be doing to increase your productivity, but start
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.280]   with this one. And it basically orders all of the evidence based
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.560]   productivity tips in order of how needle moving they actually
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.880]   are. And I think that quiz would be a I've been recommending it
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.680]   today to everyone on my team being like, guys, take this
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.480]   quiz, because it's actually really good. Always, like
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.720]   whenever I take it, it always helps me realize, oh, you know,
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.440]   I'm not doing weekly reviews, I should probably do a weekly
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.800]   review, because it's a thing that is really, really helpful.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.800]   That would be where I would start. And I kind of wish I make
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.800]   made something like that. But in the meantime, I think that's the
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.120]   best resource that I can point people to,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.640]   you know, obviously, I haven't taken this quiz, I probably will
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.480]   do it as soon as we wrap up, I'll put the link to the show
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.240]   notes. Let's run through a few aspects of productivity that I
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.240]   think I'll focus on ones that I'm more most interested in,
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.680]   which is just not wasting time, procrastinating, pushing things
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.800]   off, getting distracted. What are your suggestions there? I
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.400]   know, this was an interview, I was really excited to prepare
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.160]   for yet somehow, even though there was a hard start, you
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.840]   know, last night, I found myself going down a rabbit hole of
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.200]   something that was less time sensitive, but definitely
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.160]   interesting. Help me out.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.240]   Yeah, the whole thing about procrastination. I'm in the
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.760]   process of writing three book chapters on this for my book. So
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.200]   I've had the whole procrastination thing in my
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.800]   mind and in my headspace for the last few weeks. Essentially, I
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.000]   think the first step is to appreciate the difference
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.120]   between procrastination and prioritization. Because I'm a
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.200]   big believer of the, you know, a lot of people will say that
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.720]   they don't have time to do something. I know that you
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.920]   want like that, because you're, you're in this optimization
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.560]   space. But when people say, Oh, I don't have time to do x, you
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.960]   know, I want to learn Japanese, but I don't have time. I always
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.000]   think, you know, if, if I'm in the mode of giving unsolicited
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.200]   advice, or if they're asking me for advice, I'd be like, okay,
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.600]   do you do not have time, like genuinely? Or is it just not a
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.400]   priority? And you have people like, No, I don't, I don't, I
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.760]   don't feel like I have the time. I work full time. I've got kids,
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.000]   I've got to put them to bed. I'm like, Okay, fair enough. I'm
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.840]   gonna time that. Basically, what that means is it's not a
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.080]   priority. When I say something like, okay, if I if I gave you a
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.520]   million dollars, every time you did 20 minutes of Japanese
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.640]   practice, would you do the 20 minutes of Japanese practice?
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.920]   Oh, hell, yeah. Okay, cool. So you've you're consciously deep
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.000]   prioritizing Japanese, because there are other more important
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.160]   things in your life. And that's totally fine. That doesn't mean
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.960]   you're procrastinating from this thing. So there's no need to beat
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.960]   yourself up about it just means it's not a priority in your
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:51.040]   life. And then people are okay, cool, that's fine. But But I
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.160]   have this thing that is a priority in my life. And then
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.920]   that takes us down an interesting conversation of
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.040]   like, how do we actually prioritize things that we say
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.200]   are a priority? I feel like I wonder if you're like this as
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.600]   well. I feel like it's easy to give advice. And then we just
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.240]   don't take our own advice. So when it comes to book writing,
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.760]   for example, literally last week, my editor and I had a
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.760]   call. And I was like, Yeah, she was like, how's progress on the
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.000]   book this week? And I was like, Oh, you know, stuff came up. Oh,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.600]   you know, this happened, and that happened. And this
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.840]   happened. And she was like, Okay, you know, it's, she was
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.680]   super nice about it. But she was like, you know, it sounds like
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.600]   this book is supposed to be a priority in your life. Is it
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.000]   actually? I was like, yeah, it is. It definitely is. It's my
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.720]   number one priority. And she was like, Okay, so then why aren't
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.800]   you prioritizing it? And I was like, Damn, you're right,
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.600]   Rachel. And then we figured out strategies to help me
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.560]   prioritize that and actually make time for it. And happy to
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.240]   go over the strategies. But those have really helped. And
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.360]   in the last week, I've been able to make so much more progress
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.720]   than I did in the last month.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.680]   Yeah, let's get into it. I know. The number one thing that is
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.360]   like my biggest satisfaction when I get an email from a
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.080]   listener is like, I took all these notes of tactics
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.680]   listening to this episode. So let's get into all of them.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.200]   Basically, three part way to approach this equation.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.520]   Essentially, let's start with the problem. I think my gambit
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.120]   here, my opening gambit is going to be that procrastination is
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.640]   not a problem with doing the work. procrastination is a
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.120]   problem with starting the work. Because usually once you've
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.920]   gotten started with something, it's generally easy enough to
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.200]   keep on going. You know, Newton's first law, the law of
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.120]   inertia, it takes energy to get the flywheel going. But once
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.160]   it's going, it's like, oh, you know, you're, you're into the
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.960]   swing of things, you're enjoying the thing that you're doing,
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.160]   you're getting energy from it. And it's, it's usually not so
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.600]   bad. Does that broadly vibe with your experience of kind of
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.440]   procrastinating as well?
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.920]   Yeah, I think it's probably two part, it's hard to get started.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.160]   And then it's hard to avoid the shiny objects that pop in front
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.520]   of you like an email or a news, some alert or something. So I
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.600]   think it's those those two are big for me.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.280]   Yes, exactly. Yeah. So the way I think of them is I separate out
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.520]   procrastination, which is the getting started problem from
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.400]   distraction, which is the how do I focus once I've already gotten
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.680]   started. The distraction stuff is all fairly, fairly simple is
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.520]   like turn off notifications. Great hack I discovered the
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.120]   other day, option and clicking on a Mac on your time in the
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.400]   corner, automatically puts your Mac into do not disturb mode,
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.880]   which automatically silences all notifications except the ones
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.840]   that you let through from a loved one or something like
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.440]   that. So I've been using that a lot this last week. And now I
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.200]   just don't see my notifications until I go to the toilet to take
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.840]   a break. I'm like, Oh, hello. I'm so glad I missed all the
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.720]   notifications, because they would have just completely taken
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.360]   me out of flow and gotten me very distracted. But just for
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.160]   the procrastination stuff, and we can talk about distraction in
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.320]   in a sec. If we if we accept that procrastination is
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.000]   ultimately a problem with getting started. And that's the
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.120]   thing that we're trying to optimize for is like, okay, what
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.200]   are the barriers that stop us from getting started with
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.000]   something? I think broadly, there's three things there. And
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.880]   I call them I like to give things names in my mind, the fog
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.160]   of obscurity, the bridge of anxiety, and the hump of
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.440]   inertia. Probably to come up with better names, I sort of
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.640]   have a bit of a diagram in my head. The fog of obscurity is
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.760]   where you know, you want to do a thing. But you don't, you
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.520]   actually don't know specifically what you need to do, or when
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.320]   you're going to do it, or where you're going to do it, or how
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.560]   you're going to do it. And then you're just like, Oh, you know,
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.480]   there's this thing, it's like, I need to I need to start start
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.600]   that podcast. But like, if you don't know what that first step
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.320]   is, or what the next step is, it's just so hard to even even
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.960]   think about getting started, because now there's this
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.720]   enormous, like mental barrier, that's stopping us from like,
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.600]   actually moving forward in this thing. And so the solution to
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.400]   that one is basically just make a very, very concrete plan. And
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.080]   what I like to do is separate like the planning of a thing
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.280]   from the doing of a thing, because very easy to make a
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:48.000]   plan, right? If, if, for example, I need to work out, it's
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.640]   very easy for me to procrastinate when I don't have
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.680]   a plan. I don't know, I don't know what I'm doing. I don't
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.720]   know why I'm working out. But if I was talking to someone right
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.400]   now, and they were to be like, Alright, what's your plan for
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.080]   the workout? I'd be like, I can make a plan. It's not that hard
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.040]   making a plan. You know what, I'll do it tonight. 7pm. Yeah,
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.600]   I'll go to the gym that's in my building. And I'll do you know,
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.280]   let me bring up Reddit fitness and find a workout plan. And it
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.000]   has taken me two minutes to make a plan. But now, I'm far more
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.120]   likely to actually go and do the thing I either work out, because
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.960]   I've got a slot in my calendar for it. And I know what I'm
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.280]   doing. I think it's really just about those two things finding a
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.480]   slot in the calendar, and then actually knowing what to do. And
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.040]   that is broadly how you tackle tackle the fog of obscurity. You
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.040]   with me so far? Any thoughts?
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.720]   Yeah, yeah. No, no, I'm here. Yes.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:39.080]   Nice. And then, you know, there are there are other things we
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.760]   can do with this. If I'm coaching someone or this, you
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.560]   know, this is the method that whenever I, you know, this chap
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.680]   Chris, this productivity coach that I had, it was always like,
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.040]   Okay, so for me, at the time, I wanted to take I wanted to get
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.360]   good at art. I was thinking, You know what, I want to take so
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.720]   take some art lessons, because why not? It was like, Okay,
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.600]   what's the next step? Okay, I guess, find an art teacher. It
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   was like, Okay, how are you going to do that? I was like,
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.520]   Okay, um, post on Instagram and be like, Hey, anyone want to
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.480]   teach me art and also like, just do a Google search for art
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.880]   teachers in Cambridge. It was like, cool. When are you going
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.200]   to do that? I was like, shit. Okay. I guess I've got a 15
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.720]   minutes like my calendar two hours from now. It was like,
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.200]   cool. Put it in the calendar. And I was like, cool. And it
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.040]   was like, Okay, nice. Now you've now you've got a slot in your
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.640]   calendar. Fast forward. This time next week, you and I are
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.880]   chatting, and you have not found an art teacher. What are the top
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.520]   three reasons why you've not found an art teacher? And I was
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:38.400]   like, Okay, okay, fine. I guess, maybe something came up. And I
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.280]   was super busy. Maybe I looked on Google, and I couldn't find
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.280]   anyone in the first two results. And so I gave up. Maybe no one
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.520]   replied to my Instagram thing. And it was like, Okay, cool.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.160]   That's fine. How might you mitigate against each of those
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.360]   risks? I was like, Okay, maybe I mean, I can just like look at
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.640]   10 Google results rather than five, I can maybe post on
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.880]   Twitter as well. Now Instagram, it's like you're coming up with
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.400]   strategies ahead of time, knowing that I am a dumbass, and
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.840]   my brain is going to encourage me to procrastinate from this
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.520]   thing. But if I try and nudge myself in the direction of kind
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.120]   of doing the thing that I know I want to do, I get art lessons,
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.240]   I'm far more likely to actually do the thing. And so just
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.040]   working through this loop a single time. The final question
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.680]   there is like, what is the action you can take right now
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.360]   that will almost guarantee that you'll actually do this thing
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.400]   when it comes when it comes to the thing? When it comes when it
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.400]   comes to the time? I was like, Okay, you know what, while I'm
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.360]   here, I'll just type out the message I'm going to post on my
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.760]   Instagram story. So I literally opened up all notes, I typed
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.440]   out, hey, guys looking for an art teacher. Anyone want to
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.280]   teach me art over zoom. And then when it came to two hours later,
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.720]   I just copied and pasted that onto Instagram. And now I found
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.160]   an art teacher. And just through that one action, I've been
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.800]   procrastinating from taking art lessons for three years at that
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.360]   point. And all it took was a conversation with a guy who had
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.280]   paid a lot of money to ask me a basic question of what are you
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.760]   doing? When are you doing it? And just give him just like
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.680]   giving me this framework to think about decision making
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.800]   here. And I took art lessons for about six months. And it was
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.240]   super fun.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.640]   Okay, so that's that's getting past the first start. I can't
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.840]   remember. So it was fog of obscurity, something and then a
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.200]   hump.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.080]   Yeah, exactly. Okay, cool. So fog of obscurity is the first
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.160]   one. You know, you've gotten over the fog of obscurity when
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.400]   you have a when the thing that you're trying to do, you've got
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.840]   it in the calendar, and you know what you're doing. So that's all
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.200]   you need. At that point, you have enough clarity on the task
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.280]   to be able to make progress on it. But if you don't have those
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.960]   two crucial points, and everything else is kind of goes
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.840]   out the window, basically getting clarity on what you're
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.800]   doing, and when you're doing it is like just the magical
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.520]   solution to that. And you don't need to pay a performance coach
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.440]   large amounts of money to encourage you to basically do
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.920]   that. The next one is what I like to call the bridge of
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.880]   anxiety. And this is where we appreciate that a lot of
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   procrastination doesn't come from not having the time to do
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.640]   something. It comes from actually like our emotions that
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.880]   get in our way. And there's a researcher called Tim Pitchell,
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.640]   who has a great book, I think it's called the procrastination
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.240]   puzzle, which is basically all about the emotional side of
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.360]   procrastination. And he researches this and talks about
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.600]   all the all the different emotional barriers that get in
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:13.120]   our way. And so for example, if you know, the example I use a
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.840]   lot is people who procrastinate from starting a YouTube channel,
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.520]   for example, and it's like, yeah, I know that I've got my
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.520]   time slot. And I know, I just need to film this video, because
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.800]   I've taken Ali Abdaal's course on YouTube, whatever, I know, I
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.720]   just need to film the video. But you're in the time slot, and
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.080]   there's something that's stopping you something that's
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.360]   holding you back from doing this thing, which you claim to want,
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.640]   actually, it's like, what's going on there. And there's this
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.720]   thing in the world of meditational mindfulness called
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:41.400]   the RAIN method. Have you come across this? No. So the RAIN
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.680]   method, Tara Brock talks about this quite a lot, I think is
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.760]   invented like 20 years ago by some other meditation
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.920]   practitioner. Basically, the idea is that anytime an emotion
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.320]   is getting in our way, we want to follow the RAIN method. So
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:57.800]   R A I N. So R is recognize. So recognize that what what the
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.120]   feeling is, it's getting in the way in the case of, I'm
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.880]   struggling to start my YouTube channel, I'm struggling to post
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.960]   that video, it's probably some kind of fear, or rather some
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.880]   kind of anxiety, because I'm going to cite Brene Brown's
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.280]   Atlas of the heart, which defines fear as like, when
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.840]   you're when when there is a threat to your survival right
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.560]   now, and anxiety as there is a potential threat to your
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.560]   survival at some point in the future, maybe. And so no one
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.000]   ever procrastinates from running away from a lion. But we
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.160]   procrastinate from public speaking, we procrastinate from
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   starting the podcast from writing a blog from putting
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.560]   ourselves out there in some way, because we perceive there is a
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.360]   potential threat to our survival, i.e. our social status
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.440]   within our group, at some point, maybe in the future. And just
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.800]   recognizing that as a thing that like, yeah, I don't want this
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.960]   video to go out because I'm afraid of what people will think
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.440]   of me. Okay, cool. We've recognized the emotion that's
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.720]   getting in our way. And we have a for allow, which is basically
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.800]   that, that's totally fine. I don't need to moralize. I don't
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.600]   need to beat myself up for having this emotion. But yeah,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.400]   you know, I have, I have a fear that people are gonna look down
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   on me if I started a TikTok page. Because I feel that people
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.000]   are going to judge me and I feel that that's going to be really
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.040]   bad for my social standing in my group. And that's, that's
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.440]   totally okay. I'm human. Then we have I, which is investigate,
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.920]   which is like getting curious. Oh, I wonder where this feeling
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.920]   is coming from? Why do I feel like if I started a YouTube
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.080]   channel, or if I started a podcast, or if I started talking
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.960]   about airline point hacking on my on a podcast, that suddenly
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.960]   it would be a big, it would be a bad thing. I wonder what's going
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.160]   on there. And that's where you just sort of take a few minutes
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.200]   to explore your feelings around that around that thing. And then
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.760]   n stands for either nurture or non identification depending on
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.880]   who you ask. And basically what that means is just this
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.320]   appreciation in the world of meditation and mindfulness that
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.760]   we are not our feelings, just because I have the feeling of
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.720]   fear does not mean I am that that thing and does not mean
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.160]   necessarily that I need to let that hold me back. And this idea
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.120]   that like, the way you feel about something actually doesn't
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.080]   really have any bearing on whether you do the thing or not.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.360]   I might not feel like going to work in the morning, but I'm
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   going to go to work anyway, I might not feel like brushing my
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.400]   teeth, because I can't be bothered, but I'm going to brush
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.960]   my teeth anyway. Similarly, just because I feel the fear of
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.160]   starting my podcast and talking about airline point hacking,
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.680]   that doesn't necessarily mean like I have to identify with
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.760]   that I can choose to act in spite of that fear. And so
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.440]   that's where we kind of go a little bit like emotional and a
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.880]   little bit like trying to figure out and I've got a bunch of sort
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.360]   of more specific things, but I think that's the general kind of
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.480]   RAIN method for dealing with any kind of emotion that gets in our
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:29.760]   way.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.600]   Okay. I'm practically thinking about a few ways that I would
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.320]   have used this. I feel like the one place where I get stuck is
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.040]   like, Oh, I'm trying to get a specific person to come on the
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.560]   show. And what's the email say? When do I send it? And then I
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.840]   end up just sending the thing that I drafted like two weeks
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.200]   ago. And now I'm just like, I just waited two weeks to do the
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.840]   thing I was already going to do. And so I'm trying to struggle
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.160]   with because it's not writing it. I've even written the email.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.840]   It's like trying to figure out is there a more optimal way to
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.080]   do something? Maybe I can find a friend who knows the person and
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:03.280]   that would be better. So I should hold off and but I don't
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.120]   think even doing it precludes you from from finding another
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.480]   path if it doesn't work. So I think I just need to like, zone
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.160]   in on why I'm not doing it.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.800]   No, exactly. Yeah, I think that's interesting. I think
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:19.240]   that there's another point here. Again, it's fresh in my mind,
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.680]   because me and Chris were talking about this. So Chris,
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.000]   this productivity coach who I interviewed is a professional
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.920]   poker player. And I was kind of asking, we were talking about
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.040]   kind of lessons he's learned from the world of poker that
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.960]   apply to life. There's a concept that apparently people who play
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.800]   poker use, which is the idea of expected value, which you and
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.160]   some listeners might be familiar with, basically, you know, the
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.480]   magnitude of the outcome you want, like how good is this
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.040]   thing? Will this thing make me $100? Cool. And then multiplied
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.920]   by the probability of the thing happening. So if I've got a 50%
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.400]   chance of making $100, the expected value of every time I
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:58.440]   flip the coin is $50, for example, and expected value poker
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.080]   players shortened to Evie, because people like these sorts
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.080]   of acronyms. And whenever poker players are making decisions,
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.800]   they're like, oh, it's either a plus Evie or a minus Evie
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.880]   decision, that is the expected value positive? Or is it is it
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.040]   negative? And what they what they mean there is that if this
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.440]   if I did this decision every time, would it would I expect to
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.040]   come out on top? Or would I expect to not come out on top?
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.400]   Now, in the case of you're sending an email, that sounds
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.520]   like a pretty plus Evie decision. Because like, if you
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:31.680]   were to send 100 emails, maybe a handful of people reply to you,
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.800]   but it's not like there's any real downside. And so thinking
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.840]   and thinking of decisions in terms of rather than being
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.360]   wedded to the specific outcome of this decision that I really
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.520]   want this person, how do I reach out to them? I remember the
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.160]   email you sent me, you're like, Yeah, I was kind of
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.280]   procrastinating a bit. I was kind of
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.680]   I just, I just owned the email. I was like, that's kind of funny.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.040]   Because, because I have that same feeling. I'm always like,
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.360]   Oh, maybe I couldn't possibly just cold email someone I I've
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.280]   got to, I've got to find some kind of way of like, damning
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.440]   them on Twitter in some way and getting just so much work is
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.240]   still like, it's plus Evie. Like, sending a cold email is
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.200]   always a plus Evie decision, because there's literally no
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:08.800]   downside to it.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.320]   And chances are, if someone didn't respond to the email,
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.280]   they either didn't want to talk to you or didn't see it. So if
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.720]   you reach out to them through some other channel, if they
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.920]   didn't see it, maybe it'll work. If they didn't want to talk to
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.560]   they probably won't respond there either. So like, I don't
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.400]   know, I'm, I'm coaching myself through this conversation. Okay,
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.840]   let's, let's hit the last one.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.480]   The last one is the hump of inertia. And that is this
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.840]   recognition that like, for whatever we're struggling with,
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.920]   whatever we're struggling to get started with, there's always a
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.480]   little bit of a push of energy that we need to get started with
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.000]   the thing. Now, the question is, like, how do we how do we get
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.400]   there? Like, once we've got the clarity on the thing, once we've
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.480]   tried to figure out what our emotions are getting in the way,
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.400]   at some point, some some stuff is just kind of boring, and you
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.600]   just kind of have to do it. So like, how do you not yourself to
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.680]   just get started? At this point, you know, some people would say
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.720]   that motivation is a thing. And so like, you got to motivate
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.840]   yourself to do it, you got to like really want it, you got to
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.040]   want it so much that you can't breathe, or whatever these
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.640]   motivational videos say. And that's fine. But like, there's a
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.360]   great book by Jeff Hayden called the motivation myth, which
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.520]   basically argues that like motivation is a bit of a myth.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.520]   Like, we don't summon up the motivation magically to do a
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.640]   thing, we do the thing. And by seeing a small success, that
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.040]   then helps us summon the motivation to continue to do the
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.640]   thing. And so really, motivation doesn't lead to action, action
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.720]   leads to motivation. And so understanding that, I think was
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.280]   a big, big unlock for me that like, really, just because I
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.960]   don't feel like doing something doesn't actually stop me from
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:37.680]   doing a thing. And therefore, I can just do it. And sometimes
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.720]   that works, where I just tell myself that, like, I could just
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.560]   get out of bed right now, even though I don't feel like it.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.640]   That's like the motivation approach. And you've got like
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.680]   the discipline approach, the willpower approach, the David
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.120]   Goggins approach of like, well, if you're not doing it, at that
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.280]   point, you're just soft, you just got to, you know, use the
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.560]   willpower, you got to use grit, determination, discipline to
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.520]   kind of push through and do the thing. That's fine as well, that
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.000]   works. The thing that I personally like to do is I like
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.160]   to tell myself, I'm just going to do the thing for two minutes,
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.720]   and then I'm going to stop doing the thing. So I've got a couple
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.880]   of songs on my Spotify playlist, which are like two minutes long,
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.680]   like instrumental songs. I just like I, if I, yeah, I'll just
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.360]   like put on one of the songs, I'll be like, I'm just gonna do
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.040]   this thing until the end of the song. And usually the song, the
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.200]   song ends, the next one plays on shuffle. And I don't even
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.720]   realize that I've just continued doing the thing. Occasionally, I
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.640]   just do it for two minutes, and then I stop. And I think, cool,
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.280]   that's fine. It's not my day. But I say 90% of the time, as
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.600]   long as I can just talk myself into doing it for two minutes,
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.640]   then I'm, I'm unlikely to stop doing it. Because once I've got
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.600]   into the swing of things, it's a lot easier to get started. And I
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.040]   guess my kind of final kind of point on this is, if all else
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.360]   fails, something that will never fail is genuinely actually
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.000]   putting money on the line. So I know, you know, my friend Thomas
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.560]   Frank is this huge YouTuber, two and a half million subscribers,
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:53.000]   the way he motivated himself to publish videos in the early days
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.520]   of his channel, when no one was watching was an app called
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.520]   Beeminder, which is an automatic thing where it like connects to
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.880]   your YouTube RSS feed. And if you don't publish a video every
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.960]   week, it will take $30 out of your debit card or out of your
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.680]   bank account just completely automatically. And that was how
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.600]   he made himself accountable. He's like, well, I've got to
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.160]   publish a video every week. Otherwise, I'm losing $30. Now,
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.600]   depending on who you are $30 might not seem like enough
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.440]   money, but it needs to be enough money to sting. So one thing
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.000]   that I've actually tried in the past is giving my housemate 1000
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.920]   pounds and saying, if I don't do this thing, you get to keep the
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.120]   1000 pounds. And that has just worked magically for me to do
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.440]   absolutely anything. I don't like using it all the time, I'd
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.120]   much rather use all these other nicer methods. But that is a
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.840]   failsafe. If I'm ever really struggling to do a thing that I
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.720]   know I have to do, like write 1000 pounds transfer the money
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.680]   and they can always give it back to me once once I've done the
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.920]   thing. It probably depends on the circumstance. I was, I was
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.760]   running today with our daughter in a stroller, which, by the
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.200]   way, for anyone who doesn't have kids, once you start running
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.360]   with a child, you're like, I'm now a horrible runner. Like I've
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.520]   taken like 10 steps back, because, you know, I'm now
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.080]   pushing this this stroller and you just can't run as fast. I
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.680]   use the Goggins approach, which is like, am I really going to
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.240]   tell myself that I can't just make it to the you know, the
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.720]   end of this neighborhood, like if I really, I really can't do
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.280]   that, like, that works really well. But I don't think that
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.640]   works as well when you're like sitting down at your desk to
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.240]   complete a task. So having all the tools is probably pretty
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.160]   helpful. But you mentioned a few apps in the conversation, you
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.240]   mentioned you put notes in Apple Notes, you mentioned the this
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.200]   beeminder, I'm curious, right before we started, I was just,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.800]   you know, doing some quick last minute research went to Twitter,
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.960]   you posted this 24 apps that you use, I don't need to go through
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:41.080]   all 24. But I'm curious how you process information and where
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.720]   you put it. So let's just like not go down. What do you use for
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.080]   reading audiobooks? Oh, yeah, all those things. But like, what
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.640]   what is the the main stack for processing email or a new
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.400]   newsletter or something you find that you want to read later?
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.640]   Because I find that a lot of the distraction that comes is like,
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.920]   oh, there's a thing I want to read it. Oh, this thing popped
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.760]   up. How do I stay on top of it all?
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.760]   The app that I used to use until about three months ago was
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.000]   Instapaper. Unsurprisingly, it's great. Anytime I'd see a link,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.440]   I'd either share it to Instapaper or right click save
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.160]   to Instapaper or open the article in Chrome and just save
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.520]   to Instapaper and just forget about it. So that's been that
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.120]   installing that app was just frickin game changing because I
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.240]   was also getting always so distracted down these rabbit
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.240]   holes of these interesting articles. But then I saved them
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.320]   to Instapaper. And I just go through them when I was like on
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.120]   a train or on a bus or on the toilet or something like that.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.000]   And the nice thing is, as I was, as I would follow links, you can
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.880]   click on a link. And you can just save that link to
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.120]   Instapaper as well. So as I'd go through binge reading someone's
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.320]   blog, I'd be saving all these articles, and then I've got this
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.320]   whole list of articles, and it gets rid of the ads, and it
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.880]   formats it really nicely. Recently, I've started using an
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.800]   app called reader by the guys who make readwise. I'm not sure
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.920]   if you're familiar with that. So readwise is sick readwise.io
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.200]   readwise.io/ali for extended trial and affiliate link.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.800]   Readwise is basically an app that connects to your Kindle
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.120]   account, and imports everything you've ever highlighted. And
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.040]   every day it sends you an email with five of your highlights.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.080]   And that's kind of cool. It means you can revisit stuff
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.000]   that you've highlighted in books on Kindle. But they've also now
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.880]   got this feature where they import all of your highlights
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.200]   from Instapaper and from pocket and from these other read it
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.400]   later type apps. So every morning, if you want, you can
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.720]   subscribe to the email where you get a digest of five random
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.800]   things you've highlighted at some point in a previous life.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.080]   And often I'll see things that are highlighted five years ago
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.680]   when I read this book, and surprisingly, this highlight
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.880]   came to me at a reasonable time. And that helps me keep ideas
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.320]   that I've highlighted in the past, fresh on top of mind. But
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.000]   the guys who make readwise I'm kind of mates with them, we kind
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.720]   of became internet friends, and I had one of them on the
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.520]   podcast, we became internet friends through me just loving
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.320]   the app. And there they've built this new app called reader,
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.880]   which is in beta, and it's coming out like either August,
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.240]   August or September. And it's basically like superhuman, but
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.760]   for articles and books and PDFs. And well, it's not books,
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.720]   articles and PDFs and things that you want to read. And it's
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.000]   amazing. So that this reader app in beta, I've got the test
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.360]   flight version on iOS is currently how I consume
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.360]   everything. I just save everything to it. It's great.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.400]   It's got like a Chrome highlighter, it means that any
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.840]   anytime I'm reading anything, whether it's a PDF or a blog
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.960]   post or an article or a tweet thread, just go straight into
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.680]   reader. And it means I can deal with it at a later date rather
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.680]   than it distracting me from whatever I'm doing in the
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.520]   moment. Yeah, this superhuman for is like a sucker hook for
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.200]   me, right? I for anyone not listening, I think I've talked
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.400]   about superhuman in the past. I never thought I looked at my
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.680]   email, and I had all these invitations. So superhuman is
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.200]   this new replacement email interface there for Gmail. And
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.400]   I'm like, gosh, I had a schedule a call schedule a call like for
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.880]   every they make you schedule a call to get to know the product
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.960]   before you sign up, because it costs I think about $20 a month,
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.840]   all the hacks.com slash superhuman affiliate link on my
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:56.880]   side for a free trial. But I never did it because I never
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.640]   wanted to take the plunge because I was like, really, I'm
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.280]   gonna pay for email like this is crazy. And then finally, I was
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.280]   like, okay, I'm just gonna try it because I do a lot of email.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.600]   And there was one feature I needed. And Gmail didn't have
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.360]   it. And the feature, which is probably not important to that
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.720]   many people is I was wanted to look at emails I'd gotten from
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.040]   listeners and people and see all the other emails they've sent.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.760]   And Gmail has this feature, but it doesn't work if you have
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.120]   aliases. So for my Gmail, I send from my personal email, my work
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.560]   email, all this stuff. Gmail only works if that email came to
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.960]   or from the core Gmail account. And superhuman did the other
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.800]   thing. And so what I wanted to be able to do is know if we've
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.160]   talked about something in the past and all that. So I was
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:41.200]   like, I'm gonna try it out. And now it's like, magical, right,
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.760]   like setting up different snippets to auto send things to
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.120]   it's just like changed everything. So when you say this
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.840]   is like superhuman for this, I'm like, where's the link, I want
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.640]   to install it, I'm going to pay for it. It's great.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.960]   Yeah, I can hook you up with beta access. If you'd like, I
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.200]   can do an email intro to the guys. I think you'd really like
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.240]   it. Yeah, that'd be great. What are there other apps like that
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.120]   that have kind of changed your change your productivity stack
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.960]   make you operate more efficiently that, you know, are
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.920]   not the obvious?
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.680]   Yeah, I mean, I've tried dozens, if not hundreds over the years.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.360]   Part of being a I guess productivity YouTuber is that
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.600]   there's an incentive for me to try out every app on the market
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.440]   and maybe decide if I want if I want to use it. We use notion
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.400]   for organizing basically everything in our business, all
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.440]   of our content production for YouTube videos, and for podcasts
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:29.520]   and for Twitter threads and for everything. I've recently
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.200]   started using mirror mi ro, which is this interactive
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.480]   whiteboarding software just gives you a blank canvas where
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.960]   you can put post notes. And that's really useful for like
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.640]   brainstorming and whiteboarding ideas for my book or for courses
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.360]   that we're working on. Honestly, like having tried like dozens of
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.680]   these apps, I just tend to default to Apple Notes, if I
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.600]   want to write something down, it goes into Apple Notes. And I
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.760]   don't think too hard about it. So having tried
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.520]   Do you use anything for task management?
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:02.640]   Yeah, so I, I use to do list, but it's kind of annoying, kind
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.880]   of annoying. And so we're moving to notion because I delegate a
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.480]   lot of things to my assistant times two. So to do it is kind
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.720]   of annoying for that. So we're actually switching to notion for
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.320]   task management.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.200]   But for someone who doesn't have an assistant, do you think so I
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.840]   use notion for a lot, right? We have one notion, that's
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.160]   everything related to all the hacks. I have another notion,
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.880]   that's everything for our family, like all the red, we're
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.400]   planning a trip, where do we put the notes for it? Where do I log
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.000]   the flights? What are we looking at? You know, for our daughter,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.760]   what is the baby registry? What do we need to go by? What is the
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.000]   schedule of doctor's appointments, all this stuff. So
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.600]   I'm a huge fan, but I find that getting information in and out
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:44.080]   of it is more like a project than like a quick, oh, I got to
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:49.120]   do this thing. Throwing it into notion isn't the easiest. So how
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.200]   do you make that easy? Or is it just, you know, it's not easy,
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.760]   but it makes your life better. So you do it.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.880]   Yeah. So I think my favorite task manager for iOS is things
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.720]   three, just so nice. The only problem is that it just it just
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.600]   doesn't work if you if you delegate things or if you have a
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.880]   team. So but if I was purely solo things three all the way,
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.360]   Todoist is a good cross platform alternative. It's free. It's on
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.880]   iOS, it's on Android, it's on Windows, etc. But also, I think
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.600]   anyone listening to this, like, if you have a job, you could
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.120]   probably like, honestly, I think everyone should have a part time
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.000]   personal assistant. And that's an absolutely life changing
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:23.760]   productivity hack.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.440]   So I do not have one. And I've struggled in the past. And like,
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:31.200]   five years ago, we I tried. What kinds of things do you have this
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.440]   person do? And do you ever get too caught up in, I want to make
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.400]   sure that they're doing them the exact way I would do them. And
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.840]   then it ends up taking more time,
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.920]   basically, everything that I don't want to do myself. So a
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:48.080]   lot of emails like the, so my assistant, Dan is remote, but
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.160]   he's based in the UK. So we've met in real life, which I think
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:54.480]   I think is like, really useful. A lot of people try and hire a VA
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.720]   in the Philippines for $5 an hour, and then they're surprised
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.200]   when it doesn't work. But like, if you have the ability to hire
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.000]   someone that you can potentially work with in real life, some of
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.880]   the time, or at least meet in person, it's like, just really
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.440]   nice. But anyway, Dan basically goes through all my emails, he
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.840]   deals with all my scheduling, things like scheduling this
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.800]   podcast, for example, I have basically outsourced the
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.720]   management of my calendar to Dan. So he deals with it. And it
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.480]   means that as emails come in and stuff, I I'm actually not the
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.960]   first person to see an email, I'll see the superhuman
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.640]   notification on my phone. And if it's something like really
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.520]   interesting, or really urgent, then I'll reply to it there. And
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:31.560]   then, yes, scheduling and emails is a bit is a big one. But just
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.200]   like beyond that, there's a lot of random admin tasks in life.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.880]   Like, for example, I knew I wanted to get a cleaner for the
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.880]   house, kind of a bit of a first world problem. But like, I don't
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.160]   want to be the one calling up random cleaning agencies in
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.680]   London and trying to find a cleaner who can like be there at
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.000]   the same time that I want and like, do some of the ironing and
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.960]   like change the sheets and like, so I just said, Hey, Dan, can
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.480]   you find me a cleaner for the house? I'm basically if they can
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.160]   come in on a weekday morning and like do all the things including
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.240]   ironing, that's what I want. It was like, cool, I'll call
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.200]   around, I'll ring a few agencies, and he found someone
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:06.360]   and now we've got a cleaner. Things like, I remember when I
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.640]   first got an assistant, I was just sort of like, hang around
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.560]   to be like, huh, what are all the things I could delegate? I
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.080]   was like, you know, I wanted to learn how to play the ukulele. I
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.920]   was I said, I said her name was Elizabeth at the time. I said,
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.080]   Hey, Elizabeth, can you find me a ukulele for under like 200
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.880]   pounds, and just find some reviews and just order it. And
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.280]   she was like, cool. The next day, you clearly arrived at my
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.680]   house. And it's like, I, I'd been procrastinating from again,
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:30.560]   playing the ukulele for like two years, because all it would have
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.800]   taken was me for me to sit down and spend five minutes searching
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.920]   on the internet for what's the best ukulele for a certain
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.040]   budget. But it's in a way so much easier to be able to say
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.400]   that to an assistant or to a voice note that you can then
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.600]   send to an assistant. Right now, Dan is hunting for a new
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.000]   property that we're moving into. We're trying to move studio
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.640]   spaces, ringing up estate agents and dealing with like booking
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.280]   viewings and arranging viewings. Dan is doing all of that. And
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.400]   he's just getting them to send us WhatsApp videos, so that I
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.000]   can spend my time doing things that I actually want to be
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   doing, like talking to you on this podcast, or like making
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.240]   videos or like writing or things other than dealing with the
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.600]   hours and hours of admin it takes to book viewings for a
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.480]   property in a market where properties are moving fast. So
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.400]   almost anything, within reason can be outsourced to an
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:10.800]   assistant.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.000]   Have you ever have you done a blog post or a video on how to
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.920]   use an assistant and all the tasks you could use for them?
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.720]   No, we're working on it. I have this course idea in my mind that
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.480]   we've sort of fleshed out, it's going to be called something
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.640]   like the life changing magic of a personal assistant. And I want
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.840]   to make videos and blog posts and tweets and all of this stuff
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.240]   about it at some point soon.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.120]   And for someone who hasn't gone down the path of how how much
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:36.320]   this could cost, like, you know, you mentioned, you could go to
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.200]   the Philippines, it's super cheap, like where you don't need
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.280]   someone full time, right? This is something you can kind of
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:44.040]   start at a pretty low cost and add a lot of scale.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.400]   Yeah, I've been telling all my friends four hours a week will
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.640]   completely change your life. And if you can find someone for
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.840]   like, you know, someone local here in the UK, 15 pounds an
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:56.520]   hour, so that's like $20 an hour, or four hours, that's like
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.920]   $80 a week. And people are always like, Oh, that's, that's
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:04.280]   like $320 a month. That's so expensive. I ask, okay, like,
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.280]   this is not for students who are broke. It's for people who have
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.800]   real jobs. It's like a, what's your actual hourly rate? Like
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.040]   you're doing the whole Naval thing of like, what is what is
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.600]   what is your actual hourly rate? Should you really be the one to
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.840]   do this thing that you don't want to do? But also, the other
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.360]   way of thinking of it is like, if you could free up four hours
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.200]   of your time to, for example, spend with your family, how much
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.360]   would that be worth to you over the long term? It's like, okay,
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.560]   it probably probably worth more than $20. Right? So now that
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:32.280]   that gives you an idea of how much it would potentially be
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.960]   worth hiring an assistant for. I'm so bullish on the part time
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.400]   personal assistant thing. I think I think it's great.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.360]   I got this email from someone this morning. I'm going to
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.160]   butcher the name, but Lee Aaron, and they were like, Hey, can you
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.400]   do an episode on family life? And they've talked about it a
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.880]   little but like, I have no time. Like, how do I maximize my time?
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:53.880]   So this is a great example to the Aaron who wrote in something
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.600]   to consider to buy back some time. And I'm a big fan of
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.480]   buying time, like to the extent that you can find a person to
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.920]   do a thing that you don't want to do, or not that you don't
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:05.880]   want to do. I used to love cooking. And before kids
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.400]   cooking was like in lieu of sitting on the couch doing
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.560]   nothing. And that trade off was good. Now cooking might be in
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.320]   lieu of spending time with your kids or working or doing these
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.960]   other things because you just have less time. And so, you
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.160]   know, it's not that I don't like it, it's that I now have
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.400]   different priorities, because there are more things on my
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.920]   plate. And so whatever's at the bottom of that list, I find that
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:29.160]   we often are doing those things, even though we might not
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.360]   actually prioritize them because they have to happen. But to the
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.200]   extent you can hire someone to cook or to clean or to do
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.560]   whatever task it is on your list, it sounds like I need to
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:43.560]   test out one of these VA services or find someone. I keep
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.560]   procrastinating, I keep procrastinating, I got to make
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.440]   it I got to, I got to get get something very clear of what I'm
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.320]   going to do next and get it in motion.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.360]   I mean, so Chris, the the next question I would ask you is,
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.040]   okay, when are you gonna find a VA?
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:59.520]   I'm gonna if I'm being honest, right, I'm gonna right now I
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.720]   have like a couple tables. So this is a great segue. But
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.120]   before I want to hit one thing, and then I want to jump to what
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:09.480]   I think will be a great way to answer this. But you mentioned,
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.080]   you know, you read a lot, you save notes from Kindle, you find
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.640]   them all over the place. I've seen that you write a bunch
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.600]   about reading effectively and efficiently. And so I want to
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.120]   wrap up the the productivity thing with what you're doing
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.360]   there. Because I have a lot of books, I enjoy reading them, but
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.800]   I don't think I'm doing it right. And I know that sounds
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.400]   so ridiculous. Like I know how to read the words on the page.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.560]   But I feel like if you've written posts, and made videos
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.040]   about reading effectively and efficiently, I'm confident that
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.200]   there's a way I can do it better.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.880]   So do you read on physical book or Kindle? Or what's your?
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:45.840]   To be honest, I, I, a lot of times get the ebook. And then I
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:48.440]   but I sometimes really prefer the physical book, but I could
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:51.840]   do both. I'm not like wedded to one or the other. But I am not
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.400]   good at audiobooks, despite being great at podcasts. I don't
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.040]   know, I feel like whenever I'm listening to an audiobook,
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:02.280]   sometimes I get distracted. And then I realized, Oh, I missed
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.160]   the last five minutes. And if I try to not be distracted, and I
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.840]   just like lie in bed to listen, then I find that, you know, I
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.680]   might fall asleep or something.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:14.120]   Yeah, sure. No, I know. I know what you mean. I guess, another
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.400]   question I would ask, and maybe you can answer like what your
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.720]   listeners would be thinking about this is like, why do you
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.080]   want to read more effectively? Like, what's, what's the point?
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:26.040]   retention, you know, I, like, I read a lot of things. And I
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.680]   learned these fascinating things, especially when I'm
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.760]   reading books that people I'm interviewing have written, I
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.960]   want to remember those things, not just for five minutes, you
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:36.440]   know, not just for the day, I want to process them. And then,
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:40.640]   you know, to the extent they're a way to read, I don't know,
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.560]   faster or more efficiently, like that there's kind of like
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.840]   efficiently, maybe effectively, it's like effectively, I retain
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.960]   the information efficiently, it just happens faster.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.360]   Yeah, sure. Have you come across building a second brain?
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:55.720]   So I'm going back and forth with Tiago, who will come on the show
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.000]   a little later this year.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.680]   Amazing. Yeah. That's the I mean, I took his course in like
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:05.200]   2019 2020, something like that. And that introduced me to a lot
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:09.480]   of ideas around kind of retention of stuff and taking
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.360]   information and doing useful things with it. It's a fairly
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.080]   expensive course, but the book covers all of the things and the
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.360]   book is like, you know, the price of a book, it's recently
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.280]   come out. But broadly, I think the easy hack, we're all about
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:28.800]   hacks here for remembering stuff is to basically use readwise, I
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.360]   have yet to find an app that is better than readwise at this,
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.360]   which if you're highlighting things on Kindle, it
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.840]   automatically files them. It also has like an app where you
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.600]   can literally scan the text of a book as you're reading it, if
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:44.920]   you want a thing, and it will OCR recognize the characters, and
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.480]   we'll recognize what book it's from. And we'll just categorize
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.440]   it automatically. And then just the by virtue of reading that
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.880]   email every day of like five highlights five things that have
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   resonated enough with you for you to want to highlight that I
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.400]   found that to be genuinely the single biggest thing that has
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:03.160]   changed the game in terms of my retention of ideas. And people
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.040]   was like, Oh, you know, when you're on podcasts, how are you
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.440]   able to cite all these sources and these books and quotes and
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.560]   stuff? I don't think I look at the readwise email. Once in a
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.840]   while, I just kind of resurfaces the quotes. That's like, I think
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.720]   the basic level that does most of the good stuff to make sure
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.560]   I got that if you scan the page of a physical book, like I mean,
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:24.560]   Apple now has this live text, right? You could just copy and
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.920]   paste the text, but this actually knows what book it is.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.960]   And we'll actually store that information also.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.400]   I think so. I think there may be an intermediate step where like
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.600]   it connects to your Amazon account, and it therefore knows
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.840]   what book you own. And sometimes you have to like type in the
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:43.160]   name of the title or something. But like, yeah, it's pretty,
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.640]   it's pretty magical when it works. There is an intermediate
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:50.040]   step when that particular thing doesn't work. Okay. So that
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.400]   would be how I do the whole retention thing broadly. I mean,
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.160]   the actual way of retaining anything is to find a way to use
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.280]   that information in your day to day life, maybe to create a
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:02.680]   piece of content or something or other based around that. So if a
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.720]   book really, really resonates with me, I've got loads of
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.480]   highlights for it, I will try and write a book summary or write
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.520]   like a tweet thread summary of a book or make a video about the
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.200]   book or interview the author of the book and talk to them about
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.560]   the book, just some kind of output that creates this
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:21.480]   tangible thing, which is a reason to actually bother
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.720]   retaining the stuff. Because it's all well and good saying
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.840]   that, like, oh, like, I have this all the time, like, oh, I
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.440]   really want to, like, remember what's in this book. But if I'm
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.920]   not creating anything from it, it's, it's going to be hard
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:36.720]   beyond looking at my readwise email every day. So for me, it's
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:40.000]   easy, because I do videos about books. And that helps me helps
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.720]   me remember a lot of the things. Readwise also synchronizes to
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.800]   notion. And so I've got a notion page that has literally
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.000]   everything I've ever highlighted in my life on Kindle or
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.480]   Instapaper or reader or pocket or any other app I've used to
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.520]   read books or read articles. And so if I ever need ideas for
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.720]   videos, I'll just look through my highlights and be like, cool,
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.080]   that's a cool idea. That's from that book. All right, cool.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.040]   Let's piece things together and turn it into a video.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:05.160]   Yeah, Nick Gray was on the show a couple weeks ago, and talked
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.040]   about friends newsletters. So I'd say if you need a way to
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.880]   take the interesting content you're consuming, I can promise
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.160]   you that it's most people at least I do from your newsletter
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.440]   find interesting. Oh, here's this app I checked out. Here's
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.520]   this book I read, here's this thing I found. And so he
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.920]   proposed that everyone start a friends newsletter, that's just
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.360]   you know, send your emails, friends an email, whether it's
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.360]   weekly, monthly, quarterly. And I feel like that would be a
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:30.440]   great place to put this stuff and reinforce it, which will
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.160]   help you remember it. So nice. There's there's one tip from
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.640]   that episode. I always try to wrap these conversations up with
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.920]   asking people love to travel and listen to the show. And they
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.120]   always say, you know, I started doing this thing where I ask
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.920]   everyone I interview, to pick a city they know, well, I'm, you
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.720]   know, maybe London for you, and give people a suggestion of
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.960]   where to go, where would you recommend someone who hasn't
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.800]   been to London, or if there's another city, you know, better,
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:59.280]   go for a meal, have a drink and something unusual to do that.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.800]   That isn't the obvious. Nice. So I would actually go for
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:07.160]   Cambridge. So I spent nine years in Cambridge, which is just an
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.000]   hour north of London. That's where I went to university where
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.240]   I worked as a doctor and where I spent a year of pandemic kind of
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:15.960]   grew my YouTube channel. The nice thing to do in Cambridge is
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:19.440]   go punting, you get these little boats, you sort of get this rod
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.720]   and you sort of pull yourself along the river with a rod. And
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:24.360]   it's super nice when the weather is good. And then there's this
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.360]   restaurant, this cafe called Fitz Billy's, which does a really
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:31.120]   good afternoon tea. You can have tea with scones and jam and
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.560]   clotted cream. And it's very nice British type thing. And
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.840]   you like punt along the river. And then you have your tea and
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.200]   scones and Fitz Billy's. And it's a great vibe. Fantastic day
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:40.840]   out with the family.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:45.160]   That's exactly what I'm looking for. Okay, last thing, where
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.520]   where should people find everything you're working on
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.560]   online?
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:52.080]   Yeah, so probably my website, Ali Abdaal.com or my YouTube
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:55.120]   channel. If you just search Ali Abdaal or Ali or something on
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.520]   YouTube. It'll it'll come up.
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.360]   Awesome. I'll link to all that. And we got a lot of links from
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.520]   this episode in the show notes. Thank you so much for being
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.280]   here. Thank you so much for having me. It's been a
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:04.600]   pleasure.
