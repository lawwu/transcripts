[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   [silence]
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.660]   There's an additional category
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.100]   that I want to highlight, of course,
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.140]   and this is vitally important to state,
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.520]   even though it's obvious,
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.340]   which is that people who are pregnant
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.020]   should absolutely not consume alcohol.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.180]   Fetal alcohol syndrome is well-known and established.
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.260]   It's terrible.
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.080]   Fetuses experience diminished brain development
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.040]   that's often permanent, diminished limb development,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.960]   diminished organ development in the periphery,
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.580]   meaning the heart, the lungs, the liver, et cetera.
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.800]   Ingesting alcohol while pregnant is simply a bad idea.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.800]   And the reason I say this at all is,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.240]   first of all, it's important to include
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.160]   in an episode like this,
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.840]   but also because we can look at two things.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.340]   First of all, we can look at mechanism,
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.920]   and then we can also look at some of the lore
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.840]   that still sadly exists out there.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.320]   Let's take care of the lore that sadly exists first.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.680]   If you look online,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.380]   you will sometimes be able to find, sadly,
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.440]   that some people believe that certain kinds of alcohol
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.280]   are not detrimental to fetuses.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.440]   They'll say, well, champagne is safe
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.260]   for a pregnant mother to drink, but beer is not.
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.320]   That is absolutely categorically false.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.240]   Alcohol is alcohol.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.920]   There is no evidence whatsoever
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.640]   that consuming certain types of alcohol
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.500]   is safer for fetuses than others.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.560]   Alcohol is a toxin,
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.080]   and the reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.920]   is because the ability of that toxin
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.100]   to disrupt cellular processes.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.240]   Remember tumor growth and the way that alcohol
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.680]   can accelerate tumor growth by proliferation of cells,
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.480]   the wrong cells, the ones you don't want to proliferate?
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.320]   Well, all of embryonic development,
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.280]   all of fetal development, it's not the growth of a tumor.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.880]   It's obviously the growth of an embryo,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.360]   and it's done in a very orchestrated way.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.040]   I started off studying brain development.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.660]   That's where I got my beginnings in neurobiology,
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.620]   and I still teach embryology to medical students
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.400]   and graduate students.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.380]   The set of coordinated processes that has to take place
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.040]   from conception to birth in order to give rise
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.180]   to a healthy embryo is so, so dynamically controlled
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.640]   and so exquisitely precise with checkpoints
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.240]   and recovery mechanisms and redundancy
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.840]   in the genes that are expressed to make sure
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.640]   that if anything goes wrong, it's repaired, et cetera.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.560]   Alcohol as a mutagen, I haven't used that word yet,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.000]   but a substance that can mutate DNA
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.040]   through alterations in DNA methylation
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.220]   and these checkpoints in the cell cycle.
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.240]   Alcohol as a mutagen is one of the worst things
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.720]   that a developing embryo can be exposed to.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.800]   And again, because it's water-soluble and fat-soluble,
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.640]   ingestion of alcohol when people are pregnant
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.980]   passes right to the fetus.
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.480]   Now, I realize that a number of people out there
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.800]   might be thinking, "Oh, goodness, you know,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.020]   "I didn't realize I was pregnant
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.780]   "until a certain stage of pregnancy,
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.000]   "and before I realized I was ingesting alcohol."
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.840]   Obviously, one can't undo what's been done,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.120]   but I want to also emphasize that fetal alcohol syndrome,
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.480]   while yes, there's a full-blown syndrome
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.000]   that manifests as changes in the craniofacial development
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.880]   that are very obvious, and you can look these up.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.000]   You've probably seen these before,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.640]   or the pictures before, rather.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.600]   It has to do with eye spacing, forehead size,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.640]   a number of other features of the craniofacial development,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.520]   and of course, stuff's going on in the brain too.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.320]   It's along a continuum.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.780]   So it is possible that some of the changes that occur
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.620]   are more minor, and thankfully, the young brain,
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.440]   in particular the early postnatal brain,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.540]   is incredibly plastic.
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.720]   There are things that can be done
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   in order to help recover neural circuits
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   that didn't develop well, et cetera.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.120]   But even though it's somewhat obvious, or should be obvious,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.520]   I really want to make clear that there's zero evidence
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.240]   whatsoever that certain forms of alcohol
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.400]   are safer for pregnant women to ingest than others.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.540]   Absolutely wrong.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.840]   No one who's pregnant
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.900]   should be ingesting alcohol whatsoever.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.160]   And certainly, if people feel like
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.220]   they can't avoid alcohol while pregnant,
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.000]   they really need to work with somebody
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.840]   to make sure that it just absolutely doesn't happen
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.740]   because it is so detrimental to the developing fetus.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.320]   [upbeat music]
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.740]   [upbeat music]
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.480]   (upbeat music)
