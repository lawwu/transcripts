[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.820]   I'm here at beautiful Malibu High School and I'm with the one and only Stu McMillan who is a
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.120]   sprints coach and is considered one of the premier sprints coaches in the world. He's highly revered,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.060]   he's highly sought after because he's the man with the knowledge about how to sprint better
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.620]   and faster and he has a lot of knowledge about running in general and today I want to learn
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.440]   how to actually sprint properly. Perfect, let's do it. All right, first of all, we're not going to go
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.200]   for a jog. Sprinters are not joggers. It's a very, very different gait pattern. We don't jog at all.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.000]   The way in which we warm up typically is we skip and stride. So we sprint, but really, really slowly
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.120]   and skipping is a gait pattern that is very, very similar to sprinting. So if you think about what
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.680]   happens when you skip, there's stiffness at the ankle, at the knee and the hip, and there's a
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.840]   systemic stiffness and they coordinate together to keep you tall and bouncy. When you jog, you kind of
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.760]   roll through your ankle, you roll through your knee, and you just kind of push your way around the track or
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.680]   push your way around the grass. So we're going to skip instead. It'll just look like this. So the legs stay
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.520]   straight, allow the arms just to bounce back and forth. So a couple of differences between kind of
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.560]   jogging and running fast or striding or sprinting. You said you want to kind of learn how to stride. So
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.940]   that's the right terminology because really we're not going to sprint. Sprinting is something that very,
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.520]   very few people can actually do. We can get into the science behind that, but you can stride.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.040]   And the difference is really striding kind of happens in front of the center mass. Everything's
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.000]   out here. We're jogging and running kind of happened back here behind the center. So when we do this,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.260]   we're going to do a stride right now. Really slow, like jogging speed, but think about it happening
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.420]   in front of the center mass. So all you're going to be thinking about is pulling your thighs forward
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.120]   and jogging in front. Okay. Don't reach out or anything. It just, it'll kind of look like this
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.820]   if I do it in front of you. Just that, just bringing your thigh in front and not leaving the foot behind
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.860]   you. So do I want to think about a little bit like instead of a high knee, it's a low knee. It's a low
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.120]   knee. The only cue is pull the thigh forward and be flat on the ground. And I'll tell you why flat on
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.040]   the ground in a minute. Okay. Just like this.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.920]   Yeah. You got it now. Yeah. It took you a few steps. So you're there. You're there now.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.860]   I had to get my arms into it for it to start happening. Yeah. So one of the other big differences
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.500]   between running and sprinting is the postural considerations. Posture and jogging and running
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.220]   is kind of closed. Everything's down here. It's very, very efficient. Sprinting is really expressive.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.120]   It's very tall where you're using your entire body. Jogging is kind of a lower body activity.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.820]   Sprinting is a total body activity. So think about boxing. So if you were to hit a heavy bag as hard
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.300]   as you can, you're going to squeeze your wrist and hold your wrist as stiff as you can and squeeze
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.360]   your fist as tight as you can. Because if you hit it, there's a lot of forces there. In fact,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.340]   the peak forces when you hit a heavy bag is upwards of five times body weight. It's actually the same
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.160]   is what they are when you're sprinting. You wouldn't hit a heavy bag like this. So you shouldn't
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.840]   really sprint with a really, really relaxed ankle as well. So the way I try to teach them how to
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.860]   impact the ground is to be as stiff as you can, as if you're hitting a heavy bag over and over and over
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.620]   again. So when we're doing the skip now, I want you to be really stiff through the ankle, really tall
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.340]   and really expressive through the entire body. So just there, stiff, stiff. So you can feel if you,
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.540]   you might be able to hear the pop of my feet. Relax your arms. There you go.
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.020]   Right. As soon as I get my arms into it, it's okay to kind of catch some air.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.140]   Yes. Perfect. I'll just walk on back. Think about landing flat footed. Flat foot. So you hear that
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.060]   little pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. So remember, jogging is back here. Sprinting is in front.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.540]   Okay. Easy. Just nice and easy.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.680]   Pull the thighs forward, pull them forward, pull them forward, pull them forward.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.700]   Great.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.140]   So let's skip again. So we're going to skip down to the
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.220]   chair. Okay. Find a little bit more height and a little bit more pop.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.240]   And again, really expressive posture. Okay. Just think about expressing yourself. You're up here,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.620]   allow your shoulders to bounce and to rock and to roll a little bit.
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.460]   Come here, your feet. Hop. There you go. There you go.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.680]   Great. Good.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.220]   We'll walk on back. So we'll typically do that
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.520]   eight times for about 15, 20 minutes rather than jogging.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.900]   So do you recommend not jogging before a sprint workout, actually?
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.480]   100%. Interesting.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.380]   I recommend, if anything, and this is the last one we're going to do here is just,
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.740]   you know, this in front of you. That's difficult for many people. That's a different
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.520]   and a difficult coordination pattern. Everybody can skip.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.400]   Mm-hmm.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.460]   So I recommend skipping. What I would do rather than, you know, rather than jogging prior to a sprint
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.660]   practice is skip, walk, skip, walk, skip, walk, until you're at a point where you think, okay,
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.560]   I can run a bit faster now. Do a couple faster runs and then get into it. That's how I would do it.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:48.960]   Stiff ankle, pulling a thigh in front, relax the arms, good posture, very expressive, okay?
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.420]   Pull in front, pull in front, pull in front, and the knee can start coming up a little bit higher now as well.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.340]   A little taller, taller.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:08.260]   Now, when we actually start sprinting, it'll just be that, but it'll be a bigger range of motion.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:14.260]   Like, what that is called now is called a dribble. So it's really a truncated range of motion sprint.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.580]   So if you take the full sprint and you just put it in half, that's kind of what we just did there. It's called a dribble.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.660]   Sprinting, as I said, is a whole body activity.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:29.540]   The spine probably being, if not the most important part of that, one of the most important part of it.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.020]   So we have to get some movement of the spine.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.780]   So if you think about sprinting, the hips oscillate and they undulate.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.460]   They come forward and back and they go up and down.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.740]   And the shoulders counter-oscillate and counter-undulate.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.500]   So it ends up looking like this.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.740]   And then you have this spine that rotates, laterally flexes, and extends and flexes
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.300]   to basically counteract all these forces that are going on in the shoulder and the hips.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.740]   So it has to move.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.980]   All right, so the ability for the shoulder blade to glide up and down the ribcage.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.860]   Really important, right?
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.980]   So remember where the shoulders are doing this and the shoulder blades are going
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.460]   and the ribcage is also moving as well.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.900]   If you see people who don't do this well, what you see is the torso just stacked and square,
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.340]   and the arms are sort of doing this, and the shoulder blades not moving.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.620]   The shoulder blades have to move.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.540]   Like the ones who really look efficient and athletic, it looks like this, right?
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.100]   You can tell.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.020]   So the next one is that.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.620]   We'll do an elbow push-up.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.220]   So we're on our elbows here.
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.380]   We take our shoulders down to our fists.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.820]   So we sink all the way in, protract the scapula.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.460]   We push up into a dolphin position.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.660]   There.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.220]   I'm going to sink in, come forward, drop all the way down, almost to the ground.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.060]   Like, don't rest on the ground.
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.260]   So your scapula is right there.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.060]   Squeeze, push up, and then push your scapulas away from the ribcage on the way up.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.860]   Like so.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.660]   Sink all the way in.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:52.980]   Perfect.
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:53.460]   That's great.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.060]   Great.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.700]   We'll do the same thing.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.540]   We'll do three where you go super slow, and then three where you just flow through it pretty quickly.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.860]   Trying to create the same shapes that you're doing when you're doing them slow.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.260]   Love that.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:04.820]   Really good job.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.820]   Slight variation of that.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.260]   This is pretty similar.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.340]   We're going to be in a side plank position here.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.900]   Front foot is on top of the back foot.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.860]   You're going to take the free arm, rotate under as we rotate, and drop that shoulder down
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.860]   to that fist to here, and then rotate all the way back up.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.980]   So this is an exercise just for this shoulder, really.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.540]   Rotate all the way under, all the way back up, and then reach up.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.540]   Three where you go really slow.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.940]   Three where you flow pretty fast.
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.140]   Nice work.
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.380]   Rotate the feet.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:38.820]   There you go.
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.380]   Good.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:39.620]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.140]   Really good.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:46.820]   So we're going to go in a tall kneeling position.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.820]   So this tall kneeling position is here.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.020]   We're going to take one leg.
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.540]   We're going to put it out to the side.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.420]   Try to get your entire foot on the ground, and it's not open.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.140]   It's not here.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.820]   So the whole foot goes down there.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.620]   You push actively into the floor hard.
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.060]   Okay.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.740]   Arms are going to go above your head.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.340]   You're going to squeeze over to this side.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.140]   Hold for three seconds, actively pushing.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.900]   So one, two, three.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.860]   Come back over.
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.740]   We come this way.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.100]   Don't lose the tension on the leg that's pushing into the ground.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.780]   One, two, three.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.220]   Come this way.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.340]   Great.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.860]   Now you do five or six on each leg.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.460]   All right.
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.980]   So we're going to go into a half kneeling position.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.300]   So 90 degrees on the front, 90 degrees on the back.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.860]   From this position here, we're going to posteriorly rotate the pelvis.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.540]   So just tuck the pelvis.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.340]   Let's start off with both hands go up.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:39.380]   We rotate to that side and then rotate back towards that back foot.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:45.540]   So you're here, side bend, rotate back, hold for three seconds, and then come back out of it.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.540]   Maintain that posterior pelvic tilt.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.100]   So now we're combining some of the patterns of the spine.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.620]   See if you remember the spine flexes, extends, lateral reflexes, and rotates.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.660]   And we're kind of doing all of the things here except for the flexion.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:02.500]   That feels good.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.780]   There, side bend.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.980]   So this is kind of what it looks like when you're sprinting.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.260]   You've got hip extension.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.420]   You've got posterior rotation of the pelvis.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.500]   You have lateral flexion and extension of the spine all at the same time.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.660]   And that feels good.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.860]   Yeah, it's good, right?
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.780]   So we try to coordinate and even combine some of these rotational stuff,
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.980]   what's called the spinal engine patterns, with this hip extension pattern.
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.300]   So that's kind of what we'll do now.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.180]   So we're going to take it off the ground and go into a split squat position.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.540]   We're actually going to hold this for 30 seconds.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.980]   Go with that?
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.780]   Cool, we're trying it.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.900]   A little bit of internal rotation with the front foot.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:47.060]   The back foot is going to be, if you're hip width there, just go straight back and then out
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.820]   just by a few inches.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.260]   Internally rotate there.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:55.460]   Drop into a lunge, where the front foot is directly on top of the laces of the front foot.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.340]   So we're in this position.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.260]   The front.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.020]   And then push that back knee down.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:05.860]   And then from this position now, we're going to pull the front heel towards the back foot.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.460]   So actively, you should feel now your hamstring engaging.
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.900]   Pulling the front foot forward so hard.
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.500]   You might be able to start, you might feel yourself starting to shake a little bit.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.900]   From this position now, we're going to rotate.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.460]   And then you side bend.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.900]   Yep.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.380]   Side bend.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.660]   Rotate some more.
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.540]   Side bend some more.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.740]   Actively pull that front heel back.
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.820]   Feel the hamstring.
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.340]   How much more rotation can you get?
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.460]   Can you suck your pelvis back underneath you a little bit more?
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.420]   There, Andrew.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:36.660]   Yep.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.020]   A little bit more posterior rotation.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.460]   Great.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.980]   A little bit higher, a little taller.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.060]   Keep the front knee forward.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.820]   Just keep pulling back with the left foot.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.940]   And then we slowly come back up.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.220]   Great.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:55.620]   So again, we're kind of just combining the important kind of secondary moving patterns in sprinting.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.020]   The ability to extend the hip and the ability to move the spine.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:00.980]   So let's do the other leg.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.380]   And start pulling and just sink yourself into it.
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.660]   Pull yourself into the ground.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.220]   Try to breathe as naturally as you can.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.980]   Keep pulling, keep pulling, keep pulling.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.580]   This is what we call the dynamic mobility portion of the warm-up now.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.700]   So we're going to skip.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.100]   And every third step, we're going to drop into a lunge.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.140]   All right, so it'll look like this.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:35.300]   So skip, skip, drop, up, reach, skip, skip, drop, up, reach.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.460]   Again, we're working on that hip extension pattern.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:42.820]   Everything we do from the warm-up is really trying to get better access or gain better access to hip extension.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.500]   Skip, skip, skip, drop, good.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.100]   Reach both hands up.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.660]   Push the rear knee back up as well.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.380]   Straighten the back leg.
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:51.940]   That's awesome.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.180]   Great.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.420]   In this portion of the warm-up, we try to move the body in three planes,
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.420]   three velocities, and three types of range of motion.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.380]   So we've gone forward.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.660]   Now we're going to go sideways.
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.180]   Really, I mean, we've got a lot of sort of lateral forces, rotational forces when we sprint.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.780]   So it's important that we just don't go straight, and we don't just go forward.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.060]   We do all things.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.740]   So we're going to do a side shuffle.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.100]   It's the same as before, though.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.220]   Everything that we do, think about being flat-footed on the ground.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.540]   So you're impacting the ground like you're punching it.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.100]   We're never here up on our toes and never down here on the heels.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.980]   It's flat foot.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:28.340]   So even on the shuffle, think about pulling the laces up towards the knees.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:33.460]   But if you remember, the difference between sprinting and jogging is the expressiveness
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.220]   of it and the posture of it.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.940]   So we're not going to shuffle down here.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:44.340]   It's up here with big arms, opening up, and we'll come down to around where the pole is,
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.100]   and then the same thing going back.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:46.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.020]   Great, great, great.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:52.100]   Great.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.540]   Good, and now we'll backwards walk.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.740]   So backwards walk.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.340]   The heel's going to come to the butt, and then reach back behind you.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.420]   Keep the torso fairly upright as we do that.
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.820]   Keeping the foot fully dorsiflexed all the time.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.660]   That is, toes up towards the knees.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.980]   Cool, and then we'll just walk on back.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.940]   All right, so we're going to skip.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.260]   This time, rather than just being here, it's going to be big arms.
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.380]   We're just throwing about.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.340]   No real rules about what you're doing with it.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.380]   Just throw them about.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.980]   We can go this way.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.860]   We can go across.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.860]   Anything you want to do with them.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.220]   Don't worry about bringing your knees up.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.900]   Keep your legs fairly straight.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.380]   Not bad.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.180]   Okay, that's good.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:33.060]   And those little kind of dribble steps we did earlier.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.820]   Pop, pop, pop, pop.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.500]   We'll do five of those.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.700]   And then we'll go fairly wide with the feet.
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.780]   Kind of one bounce in the middle.
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.740]   One to the left.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.460]   One to the right.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.660]   One back in the middle.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.300]   Pop back up.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.500]   Pop, pop, pop, pop.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.620]   So it'll be pop, pop, pop, pop.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.740]   Come here.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.340]   One, two, three, four.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:54.900]   Bounce back up.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.860]   Pop, pop, pop, pop.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.220]   There.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.900]   One, two, three, four.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.780]   Bounce back up.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.380]   So try to cover those five steps in like three meters.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.260]   There.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.820]   Three meters is about 3.6 yards.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.620]   So here's the issue with most people who are doing karaoke.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.700]   They just try and move their feet as fast as they can.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.540]   We're trying to get full extension on the foot that's coming back.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:26.180]   So external rotation here, internal rotation here, counter rotation of the spine.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.500]   So the movement is in the twisting.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.260]   That's the exercise.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:30.820]   Good, Andrew.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.500]   Yeah, nice work.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:34.740]   Great.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.060]   Thanks.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.540]   First backwards one we did was just backwards walking.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.380]   Now we're going to skip.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.100]   Now heel to the butt.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:40.660]   Heel to the butt.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.220]   Heel to the butt.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:41.620]   Push back.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.180]   Yeah, you got it.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.580]   There you go.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.220]   There you go.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:43.780]   Keep it there.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.660]   You don't have to go faster.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.380]   You don't have to be bigger.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.580]   Heel to the butt.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.060]   Push back.
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.980]   Push the sole of your heel back.
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.220]   Get the knee behind the butt.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:51.940]   Knee behind the butt.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:52.580]   Knee behind the butt.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.380]   There you go.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:53.780]   All right.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:54.020]   Good.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:54.660]   Oh, man.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:01.540]   I don't think you'll see a sprinter on the planet who doesn't do a linear and a lateral leg swing.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.940]   So you grab a hold of something.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.140]   You come up onto the toe of the outer foot.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.020]   But we're just going to start off just swinging the other leg.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.580]   Trying to keep your pelvis kind of in place, but not locked.
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.100]   Like allow it to move a little bit.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.660]   But you also don't want it just to do this.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.380]   So start off pretty small.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.100]   And as you get comfortable, just allow it to swing.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.820]   And like I said, allow the pelvis to move just a little bit, but just not excessively.
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.420]   Keep the torso fairly upright.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.060]   Once we've done the other leg or done both legs, we're going to be up on one foot.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.180]   And we're going to go laterally through across the body now.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.780]   So we externally rotate when we come into adduction.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.500]   And we internally rotate when we come into adduction.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.780]   So we come across.
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:49.460]   So the toe is basically pointing towards the outside of our body on each direction.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.620]   And there'll be a little bit of rotation on the stance foot.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.020]   And again, we start off just really small.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:01.060]   And with a lot of swing, a little bit bigger, a little bit bigger.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.660]   And then it's a nice big swing.
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.100]   So again, no magic number.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.740]   I'd say somewhere between six and 12 is about good of the full swings.
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.420]   Remember the difference between jogging and sprinting.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.100]   The primary one is posture.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.300]   Posture and sprinting is very, very expressive.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.820]   And I'll say expressive a lot.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.460]   Express yourself maximally.
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.580]   Jogging is not that.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.100]   Everything jogging is down here, right?
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.540]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.380]   I'm just saying that's the task, right?
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.420]   So we come here.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.180]   We come all the way to the outside.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.060]   We come to the front.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.660]   All the way to the outside.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.300]   Come to the front.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.300]   And we'll do about five or six forward.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.060]   And then five or six backwards.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.900]   So the knee comes all the way up.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.820]   So for me, that's all the way up right there.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.140]   It stays up there as it comes back.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.780]   And then it comes down and it rotates.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.820]   That's really good, actually.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.420]   Yeah, really good.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:48.660]   Great.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:53.300]   Two more exercises that every sprinter on the planet does.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.540]   One's called an eagle and one's called a scorpion.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.900]   So we're going to do eagles first.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.780]   You're on your back.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.060]   Your arms are out to your side.
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.300]   So we're here and just let it swing.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.460]   Just let it swing.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.300]   He's making this look real easy.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.020]   All right.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.380]   And then we're going to do the other side.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.340]   We're going to roll over.
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.580]   And then it's just that side.
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.700]   Nice.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.380]   And then again, no real magic number here.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.460]   It's between six, eight, 10, 12.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.820]   Flip over onto your other side when you feel like you've done enough.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.860]   Great.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:22.660]   Yeah, really good job.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.700]   And if you want to hang out there in that extended position for a second or two,
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.300]   just do what your body's asking you to do.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:29.860]   Mm-hmm.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.980]   That feels good.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.300]   All right.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.340]   So we would typically now do a couple of strides.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.420]   So I want you to start off doing kind of the skips that we were doing before, which is low amplitude.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.620]   The knees are just down here.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.180]   And we're just thinking about the impact of the ground.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.220]   It's a pop, pop, pop.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.060]   So really stiff impact on the ground, really being kind of big and open.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.740]   And with each step, we're just going to get a little bit bigger, a little bit more expressive,
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.660]   drive the thigh up a little bit higher.
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.660]   So by the end, the thigh is going to be up here.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.940]   So it's just going to start down here.
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.380]   It's up.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.100]   It's up.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:58.740]   It's up.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.460]   It's up.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.460]   It's up higher and higher and higher.
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.740]   We start pulling the other thigh up and getting a bit more height.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.860]   Start swinging the arms.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.500]   That feels good.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.140]   Yeah, nice work.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:09.380]   Great.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.580]   I don't really typically use percentages, but if you want a percentage of your,
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.820]   if you were to go out and maximally run right now, this is like 50%.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.620]   So that's your pace.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.860]   And we'll go down to about where that garbage can is.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:26.180]   You know, when you, when you, when you cut this.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:26.500]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.500]   If they edit it from here.
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:28.820]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.540]   Just down.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:29.940]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:30.900]   Money.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.260]   You got that?
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.100]   Don't do that.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.540]   I want, I'm, I'm a big believer in beginner's mind.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.620]   Tim Ferriss has talked about this for years and he borrowed it from other people and I'm borrowing
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:47.300]   it from him and I don't want to appear like I know what I'm doing.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.060]   Mistakes and all, warts and all.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.500]   Otherwise there's nothing to learn.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.860]   No, no errors.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.740]   No plasticity.
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.700]   Lower body looks great.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.020]   Okay.
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.180]   Thank you.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:54.740]   Upper body.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.500]   I don't think you move from this motion, this position.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:58.740]   All right.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.860]   I'll open up the upper body.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.540]   So just allow that to swing.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:01.860]   Remember.
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.460]   So the hips oscillate and the undulate and the shoulders are the same.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.500]   You should feel the shoulders sort of bouncing, rocking and rolling a little bit.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.460]   So it's okay if they move.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.660]   Oh, no, it's, it's more than okay if they move a little bit, a hundred percent.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.540]   Just rock and roll.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.860]   There you go.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.500]   A little bit higher.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.860]   Pull the, pull the thigh forward.
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:18.180]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:18.420]   Great.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.420]   This requires a little bit of balance.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.460]   We normally do this barefoot.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.020]   It's cold today.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.300]   Let's not, let's not bother.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.220]   The connection between how you're applying force into the ground and what you're doing
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.060]   as you project your center mass into space is everything in sprinting.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.660]   Can you connect your foot with the hip?
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.540]   So we'll start off.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:39.140]   We'll just kind of just go into a drinking bird position, which is kind of a half RDL where
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.700]   it's, it's this thigh is back and the torso, there should be a straight line here between
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.380]   the shoulder and the knee.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.860]   You can bend that back leg if you want to, but it doesn't, you don't need to straight line
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.940]   between the knee and the shoulder.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.620]   It's about a half range of motion.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.460]   Full range of motion will be all the way down there.
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.660]   So half is here.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.260]   You're going to hold that for three seconds.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.380]   You're going to swing it up and you'll be in this position.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.900]   You hold that for three seconds.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.260]   Now this position up here, this is basically the top position of a sprint.
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:11.700]   So you'll see Andrew here that the foot should direct be directly underneath the knee or the
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.860]   lace is directly underneath the knee and the knee, the height of that should be about where
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.580]   the belly button is depending upon how mobile you are.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.340]   Well, some people are going to be down here.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.380]   Some are going to be way up here.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.620]   Some sprinters are super mobile on the way up there.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.100]   Rob's actually doing a pretty good job right there.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.860]   Hold that for three seconds.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.940]   Come back down into the half RDL position.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.420]   One, two, three.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.140]   Come back up.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.540]   One, two, three.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.020]   Right there.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:36.420]   Great.
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:36.660]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.780]   Not gripping with the planted foot with the toes.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.100]   Makes it, takes the shaking mostly away.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.660]   Exactly.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.340]   And we'll do about five per leg.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.340]   And when you come to the top, sorry, I should have looked.
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.260]   When I come to the top, my standing tall, open it up.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:50.660]   Right here.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.460]   And now we're putting all that together.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.740]   I'm going to finish up onto the toe of the stance leg.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.100]   So one, two, three.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:58.340]   Up.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.260]   And step forward.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.460]   All right.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:03.780]   Not bad.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.380]   Not bad.
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.660]   Let's do two easy strides.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.380]   If the last ones are 50%, these ones are 60%.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.580]   Okay.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.780]   So when we're just thinking about pulling forward and stepping over the opposite knee.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.300]   So pulling the thigh forward and stepping over the opposite knee.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.220]   And Andrew, you're also thinking about keeping that upper body loose.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:21.540]   Yes.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.380]   Pick your thighs up.
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.540]   Pick your feet up a little higher.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:27.860]   Up here.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.260]   Up here.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:28.500]   Up here.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.460]   There you go.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.020]   Oh, yes.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:30.340]   Yes.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:30.660]   Yes.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:30.980]   Yes.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.140]   Yes.
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:31.460]   Yes.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:31.860]   Great.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.500]   Good.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.860]   The other thing with jogging, jogging is a lot of horizontal force.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.980]   Like everything's sort of back here.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.940]   And that's what you want to do.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.300]   Where sprinting is almost 100% vertical force.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.340]   It's straight down, straight up.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.220]   Straight down, straight up.
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.220]   We have this conversation every day when I'm coaching athletes.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.740]   Just be expressive.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:49.860]   Be more expressive.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.020]   I want you to express yourself fully.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.340]   We talk about that a lot.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.140]   Like, what does that mean?
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.900]   Like, express yourself.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.660]   Be big and open and free, you know?
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.900]   Where, you know, so many of the other things, as you said, we're just not doing that.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:03.140]   All right.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:03.940]   One more stride.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.580]   All right.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:04.900]   Okay.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.780]   Same as what we just did.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.340]   I like that.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.100]   But you're just going to be a little bit more vertical.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.580]   Just think about up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.540]   Once you've got some forward momentum, just think vertical.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.260]   Up, up, up, up, up, up.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:14.980]   Just doing high knees.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:21.780]   That is a lot better than what I was thinking it might be.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.180]   Okay.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.180]   Like coming into today, I said, all right.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.860]   If I had that picture in my mind of what you're going to be able to do, I'd be really happy.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:34.020]   I hope people will try some of these things because it's a distinctly different sensation
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:39.460]   than jogging or what I think of as sprinting, which we haven't really done today, right?
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.180]   We strided.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:40.900]   We strided.
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.300]   I feel much more alert, I think, posturally.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:45.940]   I feel open.
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:50.580]   I was on a plane this morning and, you know, all that, I think the things that kind of open
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:56.980]   up your lungs, but it's not the kind of like grinding effort, but I can tell it's cumulative.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.580]   After this, I could see like, yeah, it's a workout, even though it might just seem like
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.460]   we're going a short distance.
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:01.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:02.820]   A hundred percent.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.180]   It's the most rhythmical, the most fluid, the most coordinated that are the best athletes,
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.060]   regardless of the sport.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:07.940]   It's not the most powerful.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:08.580]   It's not the biggest.
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.700]   It's not the strongest.
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.180]   It's the ones who have the most rhythm, most coordination.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.260]   And sprinting is the ultimate test of that.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:14.820]   Try it.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.380]   Do it.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:15.940]   Don't try it.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.660]   Just do it.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.700]   It's so much fun.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:24.820]   And you notice, I hope my editing team will keep in some of the wobbles and errors in my mechanical ones
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.300]   and my less mechanical ones, if they were there.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:32.580]   It's really good to, I think, to see that unless you're a natural, I suppose,
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.460]   no one gets any form of exercise exactly right the first time and just to keep doing it.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.020]   All right.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:38.740]   Thank you so much, Stu.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.380]   Yeah, no worries.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.580]   Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:49.620]   You too.
