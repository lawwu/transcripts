[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.480]   This is my third Bogleheads Conference.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.980]   I've been coming every few years for, since, I don't know,
[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.120]   2008 or something.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.720]   And this one's going to be spectacular.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.780]   I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.180]   Bogleheads University has a fantastic faculty lined
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.100]   up as you can see.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.620]   I am the least of them, and that's why I am the host.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.880]   Let's get into it a little bit.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.940]   First, a few disclosures, okay?
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.620]   All these faculty members, they work for
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.760]   or they own successful businesses.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.520]   They are published authors.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.740]   If you buy their books, they make money.
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.940]   We're not going to tell you what any of these businesses are.
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.700]   We're going to work very hard not to have any conflicts
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.260]   of interest in our presentations today.
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.580]   All right, Rick says, "I have to tell you
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.060]   about boglecenter.net," which is an awesome place.
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.440]   Many of you have been coming to the Bogleheads Forum
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.360]   for a long time and may not have known
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.100]   about this fantastic resource.
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.120]   But the boglecenter.net should be your front page
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.360]   for all things Boglehead.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.820]   You can see there's all kinds of things there, including a way
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.080]   to donate to boglecenter.net.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.820]   And I'm going to bribe you into making a donation.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.580]   When they do the book signing tomorrow, I have a few copies
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.620]   of my book that I was able to stuff into my carry on
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.720]   that I will give you if you make any sort
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.120]   of donation to boglecenter.net.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.620]   But you have to donate more than $2.57
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.900]   because apparently that's what it costs to process a donation.
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.140]   So you got to donate more than that.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.600]   But boglecenter.net is the hub, right?
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.020]   Bogleheads has a podcast.
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.360]   It has both virtual and live events like this one.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.860]   There's the forum that most
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.080]   of you probably already know about.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.140]   The wiki is a fantastic resource when you're just trying
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.040]   to look something up.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.240]   The problem with looking stuff
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.620]   up on the forum is something that was there yesterday is
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.760]   already at the bottom of the page.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.660]   The wiki is not like that.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.700]   And it tends to be more peer reviewed and more up-to-date.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.200]   And also will give you that information
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.260]   that you're looking for in a more digestible format.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.760]   There's also a Bogleheads blog.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.800]   If you are on Reddit, there's a Bogleheads subreddit.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.740]   There's a YouTube channel.
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.700]   And of course, there are Twitter and Facebook social media outlets.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.660]   And all that is accessible from boglecenter.net.
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.720]   So be sure to check that out.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.380]   All right.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.380]   Here's what we're going to do today.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.640]   We're running this operation with military precision.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.000]   We started right at 1 o'clock.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.020]   We're going to end right at 4 o'clock.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.940]   Because they got to turn this room for the reception.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.740]   So all these chairs have to be hauled out.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.940]   They got to bring in the reception stuff.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.820]   So we all got to leave at 4 o'clock.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.280]   That means we have to be done at 4 o'clock.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.860]   So all the speakers have been whipped into line.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.940]   So they're going to follow this schedule more or less.
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.700]   And then we're going to make up the slack
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.140]   with the Q&A at the end.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.160]   But this is the plan.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.840]   We're going to talk about developing a workable plan.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.600]   That's my part.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   Then we get Christine Benz to teach us
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.120]   about investing early and often.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.140]   And then Alan Roth is going to teach us about risk.
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.060]   Christine's going to come back and talk about diversification.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.080]   Then we're going to take a break.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.500]   It's a 10-minute break.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.380]   No kidding, 10 minutes after we start, you got to be back
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.300]   in your seat, and we're going to be talking.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.680]   Then we're going to -- Rick Ferry's show comes on, right?
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.280]   He's going to talk about not timing the market.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.280]   And he's going to talk about using index funds.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.520]   Then we're going to go back to Alan, who's going to talk
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.920]   about keeping your costs low.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.100]   And then the treat you've been waiting for all day is going
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.580]   to come on with Mike Piper, talking about minimizing taxes.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.500]   And that is such good stuff, we're going
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.640]   to give you a break right in the middle of it.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.840]   Another 10-minute break, and then he's going to come back
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.560]   and talk about investing with simplicity.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.480]   I'll finish up with a short bit about stay the course,
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.640]   in case you didn't get the hint
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.480]   from the book you were handed when you registered.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.220]   And then we're going to do Q&A with the five of us, okay?
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.660]   All right, let's get started with my part here and talk
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.160]   about developing a workable plan.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   And this, in my opinion, is one of the most important things
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.380]   in personal finance and investing.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.720]   But since no one's here to do an introduction of me,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.780]   those of you who don't know me,
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.100]   I'll tell you a little bit about myself.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.080]   The picture is what I like to do.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.780]   The rest is why I get to stand up here and talk to you.
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.640]   I'm an emergency physician by education and training.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.120]   I have zero financial training, at least formally, as it goes.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.280]   But I've been a Bogle head since 2004.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.200]   I had a net worth of zero in 2004, and I've been
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.020]   with the Bogle heads all the way from there
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.020]   until financial independence a few years ago.
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.600]   At one point -- I'm now the 25th most prolific poster
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.160]   on the forum.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.240]   At one point, I was the eighth most prolific poster
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.360]   on the forum, and my wife turned to me and said,
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.180]   "You're spending way too much time online talking
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.480]   about investing to not be making any money doing it."
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.160]   And so I took the Bogle head philosophy to my peers,
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.700]   to my profession, with a successful online business.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.080]   It wasn't successful initially, but it was eventually.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.560]   I've authored four books on personal finance and investing
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.300]   and asset protection, multiple book chapters, including one
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.720]   in the Bogle Head's Guide to Retirement.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.920]   I've created the most widely read physician-specific
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.360]   investing website in the world.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.560]   I have a popular podcast, and I've also created a conference.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.540]   Now, this is the fun part about the faculty.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.940]   They've all been keynote speakers at my conference.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.960]   I pay them thousands of dollars to come and speak
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.580]   to the people that come to my conference,
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.220]   and they've come here voluntarily
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.900]   for free to speak to you.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.380]   They are really a star-studded faculty that we have.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.540]   [ Applause ]
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.520]   Except me.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.480]   You're stuck with me.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.580]   All right.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.820]   So let's talk about a workable plan, okay?
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.860]   Single most important piece of advice that I can give
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.160]   to you is to have a plan.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.560]   If you fail to plan, you plan to fail, and I want you
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.600]   to write the plan down.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.580]   The reason why is that when you write a plan down,
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.040]   it forces you to actually make the plan, right?
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.480]   We all think we have a plan in our head,
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.360]   but what it is is some half-baked notion
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.200]   of what we're going to do.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.600]   And when you actually write it down, it exposes the gaps
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.620]   in your thinking, the gaps in your plan,
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.740]   until you realize that's a problem.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.780]   I don't know what that is, and you go do more research,
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.800]   or you get some help, and you can fill those gaps
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.300]   in the plan.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.000]   So you need a written plan.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.480]   The other benefit of a written plan is that you can go back
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.920]   to it and remind yourself
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.080]   of why you're doing things the way you're doing them,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.380]   or how you decided you were going to do them.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.520]   And so it's really important to write it down.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.100]   And I've been harping on this now with my audience
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.220]   for the last 12 years, and so I was really depressed
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.140]   to do a survey last year and find out that half
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.440]   of them still didn't have a written financial plan.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.600]   And so I want you to get a written financial plan, okay?
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.380]   If you need professional help to do that,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.980]   get the professional help.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.500]   A few thousand dollars
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.760]   to have someone help you make a financial plan may be the best
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.620]   money you ever spent.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.820]   It is a fantastic investment, and way cheaper than paying them
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.800]   for investment management.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.840]   Okay, so what's in a financial plan?
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.160]   Well, there's a lot more to it
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.180]   than just an investing policy statement.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.640]   It's not just about investments, right?
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.040]   You should have a plan about how you're going to get rid
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.600]   of your student loans or other debts,
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.960]   how you're going to reduce them, what you're going to do
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.940]   for your insurance, you know, we're talking
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.140]   about disability insurance and life insurance
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.880]   and property insurance and that kind of stuff.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.260]   All right, housing plan, where you're going to live,
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.140]   how you're going to pay for it, spending plan, a.k.a. a budget.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.300]   Right. Then, of course, you've got to have an investing plan.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.480]   And then, eventually, you're going to need some sort
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.960]   of an estate plan, and probably an asset protection plan
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.280]   as well.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.000]   So all of that goes into your written plan.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.500]   I'm going to focus mostly today on just the investing portion,
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.440]   but all of that should be part of your plan.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.800]   And this document is not something you write down once
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   and file away and never look at again.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.900]   This is a living, changing, working document.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.620]   So let's zero in on it.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.280]   There are five pieces to an investing plan.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.840]   Okay. The first one, and the problem is,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.860]   one of these pieces is sexy, and the other four are not.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.520]   Okay. The sexy one is number four,
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.120]   choosing the investments, right.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.900]   Everybody likes that.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.760]   Everybody likes talking about the investments.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.140]   But the truth is, that's a very difficult thing to do
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.960]   if you haven't done the three steps above it.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.060]   If you have done the three steps above it, it's really simple.
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.160]   And so, it's important that you do them in order.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.340]   Set your goals.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.640]   Choose what accounts you're going to invest in for each goal.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.300]   Determine an asset allocation for each of your goals.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.680]   Select the investments to fulfill that asset allocation.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.480]   And then determine whatever your rules you're going to use
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.240]   for changes and maintenance to the plan.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.800]   Those are the five pieces.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.580]   Okay. So let's talk about setting goals, right.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.600]   You got to set your goals.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.460]   Just set them.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.600]   It's okay if they change.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.940]   This is what keeps us from setting them.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.560]   Because we're afraid they're going to change,
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.800]   or I'm going to want something different.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.820]   You just set a goal.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.180]   So what if it changes in three months?
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.160]   You can adjust the plan for that.
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.640]   But the goals need to be smart goals.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.680]   Specific, measurable, attainable,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.120]   relevant to you, and time limited.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.620]   Okay. Here's some examples.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.160]   And these come from my original plan that we wrote in 2004.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.540]   Our investments will provide an income
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.860]   of $100,000 per year in 2006 dollars, while still growing
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.420]   at the inflation rate, providing us financial independence
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.780]   by June 28th, 2030.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.400]   That's a smart goal.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.440]   Get rich, not a smart goal.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.400]   Be a millionaire, not a smart goal.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.660]   That's a smart goal.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.460]   Okay. So some goals may have to do with your net worth,
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.900]   some with your income, some with your savings rate.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.200]   Okay. Here's another example.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.140]   We'll be worth $1 million by June 28th, 2017.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.520]   Or this one.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.740]   We'll have the equivalent of four years
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.180]   of in-state tuition at BYU.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.040]   That's my alma mater.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.120]   In each 529, by the time each child turns 18.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.100]   Right. These are smart goals.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:27.960]   That's what you want to set.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.120]   You might be wondering the relevance
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.360]   of June 28th is my birthday.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.700]   All right.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.060]   It's also important that one great benefit
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.840]   of these goals is it allows you to define enough
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.600]   so that you recognize it when you get there.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.060]   Because there are far too many people in our society
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.900]   that don't know how much enough is.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.640]   All right.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.480]   Next, you've got to choose what accounts you're going
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.020]   to invest in.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.220]   Okay. So you choose an investing account for each goal.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.900]   So retirement's the obvious one.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.740]   It's the big one.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.900]   It's, you know, as Jonathan Clements says,
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.620]   it's basically the whole point
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.320]   of your financial life is saving up enough money
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.280]   to pay for retirement.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.980]   You tend to do that in accounts like 401Ks and 403Bs, 457Bs,
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.700]   IRAs and Roth IRAs, defined benefit plans.
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.280]   If you work for the federal government,
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.320]   the thrift savings plan, and of course, you can save as much
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.860]   as you want in a taxable account.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.220]   For education, we have 529s are probably used most commonly,
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.200]   but you can also save up for them with Coverdell ESAs,
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.980]   uniform transfer to minors accounts, and a taxable account.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.720]   Health care expenses, health savings account.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.340]   Any big purchases or your emergency fund tends
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.620]   to be in a taxable account.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.440]   But it's important to find what accounts you're going to invest
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.540]   in for these goals before you get started,
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.920]   recognizing that it will change as you change employers,
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.960]   as account contribution limits change.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.000]   These ratios of how much you have in tax-protected accounts
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   like tax-deferred and tax-free accounts,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.360]   as well as taxable accounts is likely
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.480]   to change over the years.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.740]   There was a time when I didn't have a taxable account at all.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.240]   Now it's my largest account, and that often happens to people.
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.980]   Tax diversification means having some money
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.980]   in tax-free accounts, some money in tax-deferred accounts,
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.680]   and some money in taxable accounts.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.540]   That's a good thing.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.260]   But in general, you don't want to seek after that
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.920]   if it means paying a whole lot extra in taxes to have it.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.340]   So try to get some tax diversification,
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.560]   but try to get it at a good price.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.360]   All right, I'm a big fan of a top-down approach to investing,
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.780]   to have an overall asset allocation or division
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.740]   of how you're going to invest your assets,
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.800]   and then selecting investments to fulfill that plan.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.660]   So it turns out that your asset allocation is the most
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.520]   important determinant of your investment return.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.400]   The mix of assets, the mix of investments that you invest in,
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.060]   is going to cover something like 80%
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.180]   of your investing return is going to come
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.180]   from that asset allocation.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.080]   So it's really important.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.940]   It's probably not the most important thing
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.920]   that actually determines you reaching your goal.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.100]   That probably has more to do
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.220]   with your savings rate, quite honestly.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.480]   But it matters for your investment return,
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.540]   and the further you get into your investment career,
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.280]   the more your investment return affects you reaching your goals.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.520]   You want to make sure you're taking on enough risk
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.940]   to beat inflation long-term and to meet your goals.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.800]   Alan's going to be talking in a little while
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.820]   about a little more in-depth about risk.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.000]   But you don't want to take on more risk than you can handle.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.960]   I like to think of it like the price is right.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.160]   You've seen the game show, right?
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.200]   You've got to bid and try to guess the price
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.680]   of whatever they have up there on stage, and you want to get
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.100]   as close as you can without going over.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.260]   And that's kind of like risk tolerance with investing.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.160]   You want to take on about as much risk as you can handle,
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.520]   but not too much that you panic and end up selling low
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.280]   in a nasty bear market.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.120]   I generally recommend people include at least three asset
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.200]   classes in their asset allocation.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.980]   I think you can get a lot of benefits by going up to as many
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.720]   as seven asset classes.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.360]   Maybe there's some benefits as you push that up to 8, 9, 10.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.840]   Beyond 10, you're just playing with your money, okay?
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.780]   That is just complexity without additional benefit.
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.160]   So if you look at your portfolio
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.280]   and you've got 16 different asset classes,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.840]   simplification is probably in order.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.000]   And Mike Piper is going to be talking about that today.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.420]   Avoid analysis paralysis.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.560]   This happens to a lot of people.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.040]   They realize there are a million different ways you can set
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.060]   up an asset allocation, and they can't move.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.640]   They can't get started because they can't decide.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.520]   Well, the truth is there is no perfect asset allocation.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.600]   Nobody knows in advance what the best one is.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.160]   So just pick something reasonable and stick
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.520]   with it for the long run.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.600]   And that's the most important thing is that you stick
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.640]   with what you've chosen rather than what exactly you've chosen.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.600]   Because each of those asset classes you included in your mix
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.400]   of investments is going to have its day in the sun.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   It's okay to make adjustments to your plan,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.740]   but what usually happens when we're making an adjustment is
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.200]   you do what I did in 2007 when I added REITs to my portfolio.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.540]   Subsequently watched them drop 78% in value over the course
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.300]   of the next year.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.060]   Now, they've done fine in the long run because I've kept them
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.860]   in my portfolio ever since.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.300]   And my long-term return is something like 11 or 12%
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.180]   or something on that asset class.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.900]   But that first year it wasn't very good.
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.580]   And truthfully, I was probably performance chasing.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.460]   And that's what happens a lot when you're adding new asset
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.620]   classes to your portfolio.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.540]   So beware of that.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.340]   You should also spend some time on asset location.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.860]   Asset location is what assets go in which account.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.780]   I'm not going to get into the details of that, but the idea is
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.980]   that you can add a little bit of extra return there
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.700]   by managing the taxes well.
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.580]   All right.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.340]   The fourth step is to choose your investments.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.860]   You just want to choose investments
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.100]   to fulfill your asset allocation based on the availability
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.420]   in those accounts.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.100]   It can be really easy.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.260]   Like 25% of my portfolio is in U.S. stocks.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.520]   It all goes in one fund.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.380]   VTI or VTSAX, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.200]   It's my favorite mutual fund.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.940]   And that's literally 25% of my portfolio.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:05.920]   Super simple.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.520]   Right? Other things might be more complicated, though.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.960]   Like I have an asset class for inflation index bonds.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.120]   Some of that money is in a TIPS ETF.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.420]   Some of it is in individual TIPS bought at Treasury Direct.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.800]   Some of it is in IBONZ.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.280]   A little more complexity there.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.100]   And if you get into some more exotic asset classes,
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.860]   such as direct real estate investing, or private equity,
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.400]   or crypto assets, it can get really complicated.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.240]   Okay? So, in general, as Rick will tell you later today,
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.820]   favor broadly diversified, low-cost index funds.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.440]   You can just pick one fund per asset class.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.280]   That works.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.640]   You know, five asset classes in your portfolio,
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.980]   you got five funds.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.860]   Super simple.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.780]   You can even consider a simple fund of funds
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.720]   if you're only investing in retirement accounts
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.780]   and you have a good fund of funds available
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.540]   in every account.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.840]   We'll have one of our speakers that will teach you
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.560]   about simplicity who does just that.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.340]   Lastly, set up some rules.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.260]   Okay? Things change.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.000]   For example, when are you going to rebalance?
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.440]   How are you going to rebalance?
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.460]   Right? So, you need a rebalancing policy in there.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.080]   How are your investments going to be selected?
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.380]   What's the criteria for adding
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.860]   or subtracting asset classes from the portfolio?
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.700]   How will your asset allocation change over time?
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.200]   A lot of people like to get less aggressive
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.400]   as they approach retirement.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.600]   Okay? How's that going to change?
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.680]   You should put that in your written investing plan.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.660]   What are you going to do in a bear market?
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.860]   How are things going to change in a bear market, if at all?
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.120]   Put that in your asset allocation plan.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.500]   And, of course, one thing that we like to have is,
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.280]   we have a waiting period to keep us
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.940]   from doing anything stupid on a whim.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.600]   We have to wait three months before we can make any changes.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.320]   So, that keeps us from, hopefully,
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.800]   doing as much performance chasing as we did in 2007.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.620]   So, here's some examples of rules.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.960]   No asset class will represent more than 30%
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.820]   or less than 5% of our portfolio.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.960]   We'll rebalance our asset allocation
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.680]   as frequently as necessary using the 5/25 rule,
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.700]   using new investment money as much as possible.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.780]   If selling an untaxable account or selling an investment
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.500]   with significant trading costs is required,
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.820]   rebalances may be performed no more than once a year.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.740]   These are examples of what I mean by rules.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.960]   And then, of course, there's our three-month waiting period rule.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.120]   So, to recap, you set your goals.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.240]   You choose accounts for each goal.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.960]   You determine an asset allocation for each goal.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.440]   You select investments.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.860]   And then, you determine the rules for changes and maintenance.
