[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   [Music]
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.140]   We're now just one week away from Christmas Eve and a
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.300]   reoccurring question about this time appears in the birth narrative of Jesus
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.740]   about that crazy star that appears in the sky to guide the wise men to the
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.200]   birthplace of Jesus. You know the story and Pastor John addressed it in his
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.500]   sermon "We Have Come to Worship Him" which you preached back on December 21st,
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500]   1997. Here's how Pastor John explained it.
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.400]   I don't have a clue how this star worked. It's absolutely baffling to me. I read an
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.980]   article last night with four scientific explanations of how the star might have
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.060]   worked. I mean it says they saw a star in the east and then it says they showed up
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.540]   in Jerusalem. Doesn't say the star led them to Jerusalem, just says they saw a
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.620]   star and boom they're in Jerusalem. So somehow or other, I don't know, they got
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.940]   to Jerusalem and then they asked where's the baby? And it says in the book
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.220]   Bethlehem. He's gonna be born in Bethlehem. So they walk out. It's five
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:18.660]   miles to Bethlehem. That's what from here to 694 or so. And they walk and and the
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:28.500]   star shows up and it says goes before them and stands over the place where the
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.540]   child was. What kind of star is that? I mean these are not dummies. They walk out
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.360]   at night and see how far the stars are. You can see five miles. You can see 20
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.780]   miles on a flat space. They know the stars are in the heaven. So what's going
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.460]   on here? How does that work? Well you can go to the planetarium over at the
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.620]   university and find out how it works. At least one version. Or you can read
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.380]   articles. I mean it's comets, it's supernovas, it's Jupiter and
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:11.420]   Saturn going into Leo. It's some special light. I mean reject the whole
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.020]   astronomy thing. It's just some special light that God miraculously did. I
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:26.100]   haven't a clue how it happened and it's a non-point. Now let me stress why
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:35.620]   I'm stressing this. I'm stressing this because there's a mentality in the
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:46.460]   church that some people have which I call a mentality for the marginal. And
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.020]   you can't get too near these folks because they've always got a new tape
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.460]   for you to listen to. Or article. I'm really getting myself in trouble here
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:07.060]   probably. Or book about some absolutely marginal issue. How did the manna get
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.820]   there? Where did the quail come from? What kind of special winds were blowing about
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.460]   2,300 years ago to split the Red Sea? How does a man live in a fish's belly? How
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.060]   does the Sun stop in the sky without everybody flying off without any gravity
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:38.900]   or... Now this is kind of serious because, here's why it's serious, I
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.060]   wouldn't point this out if there weren't a serious side to it. The
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:51.180]   serious side is this, as I have met a few people like that, the sad thing is they
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.380]   seldom have a capacity for deep joy in central truths. The holiness of God, the
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:09.340]   glory of Christ, the horror and ugliness of sin, the deadness and barrenness and
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.020]   fallenness of human nature, the beauty of the crucifixion, the wonder of
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.780]   justification by faith alone, the precious work of the Holy Spirit
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.460]   sanctifying through the Word of God, the second coming with all the angels in
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.860]   fire, the judgment of the quick and the dead, eternal bliss at God's right hand.
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.180]   If you try to get into a conversation with these people about these things,
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:48.220]   nothing. Just go back to the margin and talk about the manna. It's sad, it's
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.860]   dangerous, something's wrong. I'm sure there's a psychological name for this. So
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.300]   if you tend to be like that, I think the solution is not to be scared now to hand
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:12.620]   the pastor a tape, but to meditate on the cross, to meditate on God. So what's
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.900]   the point here? What's the point in this text on this point? The point is this,
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:30.580]   these star, comet, planet, supernova, special miraculous light, whatever, are
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.220]   not doing this stuff of their own accord. God's doing this and the reason
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:45.340]   he's doing it is to get pagans to their Savior. That's the point. He's got a big
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.380]   wide embrace and he's showing these particular people that he's focused on
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.100]   for 2,000 years, "I'm done focusing on you. I love you.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.460]   Believe my son and you'll have everlasting life, but I'm after the
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:09.340]   nations with a passion from now on." At the beginning of the Gospel of Matthew, it
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.380]   is still a come-see religion and at the end of the Gospel of Matthew, it's a
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.020]   go-tell religion. Still coming to see, just like in the Old Testament, come see
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.900]   the temple, come see the great King, come on Queen of Sheba, come on up here and
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.740]   see Solomon. He'll wow you. Same with the wise men. Come on! He's here in Jerusalem
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:38.560]   or in Bethlehem. But by the end of the purpose of Christ on earth, it is no
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.460]   longer come see, it is go tell. Beautiful. That clip was from one of John Piper's
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.140]   many Christmas sermons over the years, this one from a sermon "We Have Come to
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.020]   Worship Him," which was preached back on December 21st, 1997. You can find that
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:00.100]   sermon and over 1,200 others right now at DesiringGod.org. I'm your host Tony
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.700]   Ranke, thanking you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast. We will be back
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.180]   tomorrow with Pastor John himself and a question from a bride-to-be. Thanks for
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.580]   listening.
