[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   One of the weird things about podcasts is that, as far as I can tell, the average podcast
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.320]   interviewer is far more knowledgeable and thoughtful than the average sort of mainstream
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.080]   journalist interviewer. I just find that amazing. I don't understand it. So I think you guys should
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.960]   be hired by the, you know, they should switch roles or something. Yes, there's this thing that
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.680]   I think is not stressed enough in history, which is that often the elites kind of recognize each
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.600]   other and they join up in arrangements that increase both of their power and, you know,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.920]   exploit the poor schmucks down below. And that's exactly what happened with the East India Company
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.280]   and it's exactly what happened with Spain. Science and technology properly applied can allow you to
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.040]   produce your way out of these environmental dilemmas. You turn on the science machine,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.840]   essentially, and we can, you know, we can escape these kind of dilemmas. And the prophets say no,
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.920]   that natural systems are governed by laws and there's an inherent carrying capacity or limits
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.600]   or planetary boundaries. Okay. Today I have the pleasure of speaking with Charles Mann,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.840]   who is the author of three of my favorite books, including 1491, New Revelations of America Before
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.360]   Columbus, 1493, Uncovering the New World Columbus Created, and The Wizard and the Prophet, Two
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   Remarkable Scientists and Their Dueling Vision to Shape Tomorrow's World. Charles, welcome to
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.040]   the Lunar Society. It's a pleasure to be here. My first question is, how much of the new world
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.960]   was basically baked into the cake? So at some point, people from Eurasia were going to travel
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.920]   to the new world and they're going to bring their diseases. And, you know, because of
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.440]   disparities and where they would survive, if the Asimov-Glue theory that you cite is correct,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.840]   then some of these places were bound to be better, have good institutions, some of them were bound to
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.680]   have bad institutions. And because of malaria, there were going to be shortages in labor that
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.960]   people would try to fix with African slaves. So how much of this was just bound to happen? If
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.680]   Columbus hadn't done it, maybe 50 years down the line, somebody from, you know, Italy does it,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.880]   what is the contingency here? Well, I think some of it was baked into the cake. It was pretty clear
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.560]   that, you know, sometime people from Eurasia and people from the Western hemisphere were going to
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.440]   come into contact with each other. I mean, how could that not happen, right? And there was a huge
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.840]   epidemiological disparity between the two hemispheres, largely because by a quirk of
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.800]   evolutionary history, there were many more domesticable animals in Eurasia in the Eastern
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.400]   hemisphere. And that led almost inevitably to the creation of zoonotic diseases, diseases that start
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.320]   off in animals and jump the species barrier and become human diseases. And most of the great
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.400]   killers in human history are that kind of disease. So they're going to meet, there's going to be
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.360]   those kinds of diseases. But, you know, it's possible to imagine, you know, if you wanted to
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.880]   some, you know, alternative histories, there's a wonderful book by Laurent Binet called Civilizations
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.840]   that in fact just does that. It's a great alternative history book. And he imagines that
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.800]   some of the Vikings came and they actually extended further into North America than they did.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.640]   And they brought the diseases so that by the time of Columbus and so forth, the epidemiological
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.920]   balance was different. And what happened was that they, when Columbus and those guys came,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.640]   these societies killed him, grabbed his boats and went to Europe. And the Inca conquered Europe in
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.120]   this. And, you know, it's farfetched, but it does say that even this encounter will happen and the
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.600]   diseases will happen, but it doesn't happen to happen in the way that they did. You know, it's
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:58.160]   perfectly possible to imagine again that Europeans didn't engage in wholesale slavery. There was a
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.800]   huge debate, you know, when this began about whether this was a good idea or not. And you had
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.480]   a lot of reservations, particularly among the Catholic monarchy, sort of asking the Pope,
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.080]   is it okay that we do this? And, you know, you can imagine the penny dropping in a slightly
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.720]   different way. So some of it was, I think, going to happen, I think. But, you know,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.440]   how exactly it happened is really up to chance and contingency and human agency.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.600]   When, I guess, in the 15th and 16th century, when the Spanish first arrived, were the Incas
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.040]   and the Aztecs, were they at a particularly weak point or particularly decadent? Or was this just
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.880]   where you should have expected that civilization, like this was basically how well it would have
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.960]   been functioning on any given time period? Well, typically, empires are much more,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.520]   you know, sort of jumbly, fragile entities than we kind of imagine. And there's always,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.200]   you know, fighting at the top. And what Cortes was able to do, for instance, with the Aztecs,
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.360]   the Triple Alliance, they're better called the Triple Alliance. Aztec is an invention from the
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.760]   19th century. And that was three groups of people in Central Mexico, the largest of which were the
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.800]   Mexica, who had the great city of Tenochtitlan. But there are other two guys who are members,
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.880]   this really resented them. They were the superior guys. And what Cortes was able to do was to
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:38.240]   foment a civil war within the Aztec Empire, and to take some of the enemies of the Aztecs,
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.560]   and some of the members of the Aztec Empire and create an entire new order. And there's a
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.880]   fascinating set of history that hasn't really, I think, emerged into the popular consciousness.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.680]   Certainly it was new, and I didn't include it in 1491 or 1493, because it was so new that I didn't
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   know anything about it, largely Spanish and Mexican scholars, about the conquest within the
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.360]   conquest. And so the allies of the Spaniards, Tlaxcalan, Tolteco, and so forth, actually sent
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:17.200]   armies out and conquered big swaths of Northern and Southern Mexico and Central America. And so
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.000]   there is a far more complex picture than we realized even 15 or 20 years ago, when I first
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.680]   published 1491. So in that sense, yes. But also the conquest wasn't as complete as we think,
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.520]   because what happened is Cortes moves in, and what he does is he marries, I talk a little bit
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.880]   about this in 1493, he marries his lieutenants into these indigenous things, and creating this
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.960]   hybrid nobility that then extends on to the Inca. And the same thing for the Inca. It's a very
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.160]   powerful, but also unstable empire, and Pizarro has the luck to walk in right after a civil war.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.440]   And when he does that, and right after civil war and massive epidemic, he gets them at a very
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.680]   vulnerable point. But again, it all would have been impossible. Pizarro cleverly allies with
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:17.440]   the losing side, or the apparently losing side in the civil war, and is able to sort of create
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.320]   a new rallying point and they attack the winning side. So he's, you know, so you have, yes, they
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.120]   came in at weak points, but empires typically have these weak points, because of fratricidal stuff
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.280]   going on in the leadership. Yeah, it does remind me also of, you know, the East India Trading
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:42.000]   Company. Oh, yeah. And the Mughal Empire. Mughals, some of those guys in Bengal invited
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.240]   Clive and his guys in. And in fact, I was struck by this. I've just been reading this book. You
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.200]   must have maybe you've heard of it, The Anarchy by William Dalrymple. I started reading it. It's
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:00.560]   amazing. It's an amazing book. And it's so oddly similar to what happened. There's this
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.000]   fratricidal stuff going on in the Mughal Empire. And one side thought, Oh, we'll get these foreigners
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.800]   come in, and we'll use them. That turned out to be a big mistake. Yes. What's also interestingly
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:20.640]   similar is the efficiency of the bureaucracy in the sense that Neil Ferguson has a good book on
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:27.040]   the British Empire. And one thing he points out is that in India, the ratio between an actual
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.640]   English civil servant, I mean, you can call them with something else, maybe but and the actual
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.640]   Indian population was, I think, one to 3 million at the peak of the ratio. And which obviously is
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.480]   only possible if you have cooperation of at least the elites, right? Yeah, sounds similar to what
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:50.400]   you're saying with Cortez marrying his underlings to the nobility. Yes, there's this thing that I
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.680]   think is not stressed enough in history, which is that often the elites kind of recognize each other.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.520]   And they join up in arrangements that increase both of their power and, you know, exploit the
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.600]   poor schmucks down below. And that's exactly what happened with the East India Company. And it's
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:15.680]   exactly what happened with Spain. And it's not so much that there's this amazing efficiency,
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:23.360]   it's that it's a mutually beneficial arrangement for them. And Tlaxcala, which is now a Mexican
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.520]   state, wasn't really fully part of, you know, it had its rights, the people kept their integrity,
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.840]   they were not part of the Spanish Empire. And it really wasn't part of Mexico until I think it's
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.800]   1857 or something like that. It was a good deal for them. And the same thing was true for the
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.960]   Bengalis, they didn't they've made out like bandits from the elites did from the from the
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:52.480]   British Empire. Yeah, that's super interesting. Why was there only one successful slave revolt
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.080]   in the New World in Haiti? Like why? Why didn't why weren't in many of these cases, the ratios
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.760]   between slaves and the owners is just, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's huge. So why weren't more
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.640]   of them successful? Well, I guess you would have to say, you know, define successful. You know,
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:17.120]   Haiti wasn't successful for you meant creating a prosperous state that would last for a long time.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:25.440]   I mean, Haiti, partly, you know, to no small extent, because of the, you know, incredible
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.800]   blockade that was put on it by all the other nations was it wasn't he is, you know, in terrible
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.920]   shape. Whereas there were, you know, things like Paul Marius, where you had, you know, for more
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.600]   than 100 years, you know, people who are self governing. Now, eventually, they were incorporated
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:50.160]   into the larger project of Brazil. But you could also point out that there's a great,
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:58.960]   great Brazilian, sort of, you know, classic, like Moby Dick, or Huck Finn is to the US is this thing
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:07.040]   called Oh, shit toys, by a guy named Acuna. And it's translated is amazing translation,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:13.280]   very good translation in English to under rebellion in the backlands. And what it is about
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:21.360]   is in the 1880s, the creation of a hybrid state of, you know, runaway slaves, and so forth,
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   and how they had essentially kept their independence, and lack of supervision informally,
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:34.000]   from the time of colonialism, and now the new British state, excuse me, new Brazilian state is
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.840]   trying to, you know, take take control, and they fight them, you know, to the last person. And so
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:47.440]   you had these effectively independent areas, you know, not in not de facto, if not de jure,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.960]   that existed in the Americas for a very long time. And there are some in the US to in the
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.240]   Great Dismal Swamp, and you hear about those maroon communities in North Carolina. And
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:04.960]   there is certainly ones in Mexico, where everybody just agreed, these places aren't actually under
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.800]   our control, but we're not going to say anything. And if they don't mess with us too much,
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.960]   we won't mess with them too much. So you know, is that successful or not? I don't know.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:22.160]   Yeah, but it seems like these are temporary successes. How long do nations last? I mean,
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:28.720]   that's true. Right. The Genghis Khan, how long did the Khanate last? It had some impact. Yeah.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.960]   So I know what you mean. I know what you mean. And basically, they had overwhelming odds against
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:39.040]   them. You know, there's a, an entire colonial system that was threatened by their existence.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:46.080]   And for, you know, the same reason that, you know, rebellions in South Asia were, you know,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:52.160]   suppressed with incredible brutality, is because it was seen as so profoundly threatening to this
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.680]   entire colonial order that people exerted a lot more force against them than you would think
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.360]   would be worthwhile. Right? It's it sounds it reminds me of James Scott's thing and against
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   the grain, you pointed out there were, if you look at the history of agriculture, there's many
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.160]   examples where people just like choose to run away, live as foragers in the forest, and then
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.880]   the state tries to bring them back into the fold. Right. And so this is yes, exactly. This is part
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.080]   of that dynamic, a certain number of people, you know, who wants to be a slave, right? And as many
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   people as possible, leave. And it's easier in some places than others. It's very easy in Brazil.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:34.240]   And so all these, there's 20 million people in the Amazon or, you know, the Brazilian Amazon,
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:41.280]   something like that. And the great bulk of them are the descendants of people who left slavery,
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.600]   and they're, you know, they're still Brazilians and so forth. But, you know, they ended up not
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:52.560]   being slaves. Yeah, that's super fascinating. What is the explanation for why slavery went
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:57.840]   from being obviously, historically ever present, but also, at a particular time, it ended being
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.320]   at its peak in terms of value and usefulness? What's the explanation for like, you know,
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.960]   Britain bans the slave trade and within like 100 to 200 years, there's basically no legal
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.520]   sanction for slavery anywhere in the world? This is a really good question. And the answer so that
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.800]   the real answer is historians have been arguing about this forever. I mean, not forever, but you
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.840]   know, for decades, and there's a bunch of different explanations. And the reason I think that it's
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:32.560]   so hard to pin down is it's it's kind of so amazing. I mean, if you think about it, in 1800,
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.720]   you know, if you were to have a black and white map of the world, and to put red in countries in
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:44.320]   which slavery was not legal and socially accepted, there would be no red anywhere on the planet. I
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.120]   mean, it was it was like the most ancient human institution that there is the code of Hammurabi,
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.400]   which I think is still the oldest complete legal code that we we have about a third of it is about,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.080]   you know, the rules for you know, when you can buy when you can sell how you can mistreat how
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.480]   you can't you know, you know, all that stuff. It's about a third of it is about buying and selling
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:10.160]   and working other human beings. And so this thing has been going on for a very, very long time. And
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.000]   then in a century and a half, it's suddenly changes. So there's some explanation machinery
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.280]   gets better. And so the reason to have people is that you have these intelligent, autonomous
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.600]   workers who are like the world's best robots. You know, if you from the point of view of the,
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.720]   of the the owner, they're fantastically good, except they're incredibly obstreperous,
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.480]   and they're, you're, you're constantly afraid they're going to kill you. So if you have a
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.880]   chance to replace them with machinery, or to create a wage in which are run by wage people,
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:50.000]   wage workers who are, you know, kept in bad conditions, but are somewhat have more legal
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.520]   rights, maybe that's a better deal for you. Another one is that the the industrialization
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.440]   produced different kinds of commodities that became more and more valuable. And slavery
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.960]   was typically associated with agricultural labor. And so as agriculture diminished as a part of the
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:14.240]   economy, slavery become less and less important. And it became easier to get rid of them. Another
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.920]   one has to do with the collapse, the beginning collapse of the colonial order. I think that
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:28.800]   part of it has to do with just a, at least in the in the West, and I don't know enough about the East,
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.880]   it's just, you know, to say, but you have the rise of an abolition, serious abolition movement
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.640]   with people like Wilberforce, and, you know, various Darwin's and so forth. And they're
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:45.920]   incredibly influential. And to some extent, I think people started saying, wow, this is really
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:56.000]   bad. And I suspect that if you looked at South Asia and Africa, you might see similar things,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.680]   you know, having to do with a social moment, I just don't know enough about that. I know,
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.080]   there's an anti slavery movement and anti, you know, caste movement, and which are all tangled
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.680]   up in South Asia. But I just don't know enough about it to say anything intelligent.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.600]   Yeah, the social aspect of it is really interesting, because the things you mentioned
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.000]   about like automation and industrialization, making slavery redundant, obviously, by the time
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.040]   that that might have explained why it expanded, but the its original inception in Britain,
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.400]   like that that was before the Industrial Revolution took off. So that was purely
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.840]   them just taking a huge loss in or B because of this, this movement took hold.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.160]   And the same thing is true for Las Casas. I mean, Las Casas, you know, in the 1540s,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:46.640]   sort of comes out of nowhere, and starts saying, hey, this is bad. And he is this predecessor of
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:53.280]   the modern human rights movement. And it's absolutely extraordinary figure. And he has
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:59.520]   huge amounts of influence. And he causes Spain in the 1540s to pass, you know, the king to pass
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:05.280]   what they call the new laws, which is says no more slavery, which is a devastating blow, you know,
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:11.200]   if it had been enacted to the to the colonial economy in Spain, because they that all depended
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:18.000]   on having slaves to work in the mines, the silver mines in the northern half of Mexico, and in
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Bolivia, and which was, you know, the most important part of not only the Spanish colonial
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.160]   economy, but the entire Spanish Empire, it was all slave labor. And they actually tried to ban it.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.320]   Now, you know, you can say they came to their senses and found a workaround in which it wasn't
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:38.240]   banned. But still, you know, this actually happened in the 1540s, largely because people like Las
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:46.800]   Casas said, this is bad. You're going to hell doing this. Right? I'm, I'm super fast, interested
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.520]   in discussing with you, once we get into the wizard of the prophet section, how movements like
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.360]   for example, environmentalism has been hugely affected. Oh, yeah. Again, even though it probably
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:03.520]   goes against the maybe the naked self interest of many countries. So I'm very interested in
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.320]   discussing with you at that point about why these movements have been so influential. But let me
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.640]   let me continue asking you about the globalization in the new world. So I'm really interested in
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:21.360]   why you think or how you think about contingency in history, especially given that you have these
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.680]   two groups of people that are separated by 10s of 1000s that have been independently evolving for
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:32.000]   10s of 1000s of years, what things turn out to be contingent and what things are, both of them end
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.200]   up doing, you know, what I found really interesting from the book was both of them develop, like
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.320]   pyramids, right, like the structure, like who would have thought that just like, within our
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.520]   extended phenotype or something, but it's also geometry, I mean, there's only a certain limited
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:53.200]   number of ways you can pile up stone blocks, you know, in a stable way. And pyramids are certainly
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.360]   are certainly one of them, it's harder to have a very long lasting monument, that's a cylinder.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:04.160]   And I see, and so pyramids kind of are, and also, they're easier to build, as you get a cylinder,
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.040]   you have to have a scaffolding around it. And that gets harder and harder pyramids,
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.720]   you can use each lower step to put the next one on and, and so forth. So pyramids seem kind of
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.400]   natural to, to, to me, now, what you make them of is going to be partly determined by what there is.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:24.640]   And so, in Cahokia, and in the Mississippi Valley, there isn't a whole lot of stone.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:30.720]   So people are going to make these earthen pyramids, and there's going to be, if you want them to stand
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.160]   for a long time, there's certain things you have to do for the structure, in which people figure
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.880]   out. Similarly, for the pyramids, you had all this, I guess you didn't, you had all this marble
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.720]   around. So you could make these things with giant slabs of marble, which seems today, from today's
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:50.000]   perspective, incredibly wasteful. So you so yeah, so you're going to have some things that are
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.680]   universals, like that, and along with the apparently universal, or near universal idea that people who
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.480]   are really powerful, like to identify themselves as supernatural, and therefore want to be commemorated.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:12.800]   Yes, I visited Mexico City recently. And then I got a chance to check out the pyramids there.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.840]   And, you know, what struck me was that, you know, I think I was reading your book at the time,
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.800]   or had read your book. And so, if I remember correctly, they didn't have the wheel, right?
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.760]   And obviously, they didn't have domesticated animals. And so this whole thing, if you think
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:35.440]   about it, is really the amount of human misery and toil that it must have taken to put this thing
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:42.320]   together as basically a vanity project. I don't know, it's like, maybe adds a negative connotation,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.160]   if you think about what it took to construct it. Sure. But you know, one of the really interesting
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:51.600]   things about Teotihuacan, and, you know, again, this is just one of those things that you can only
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.960]   say so much in one book. And if I was writing the 2000 page version of 1491, I would have included
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.760]   this. So Teotihuacan pretty much starts out as a standard imperial project. And they build all
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.840]   these, you know, huge castles and temples and so forth. And there's no reason to suppose it was
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.080]   anything other than, you know, like building the pyramids, you know, an awful experience of all.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:19.200]   But then something happens to Teotihuacan, and we don't understand why. After that, more or less,
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.160]   all these new buildings spring up in the next couple 100 years. And they're all very, very
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.200]   similar. They're like apartment blocks. And there doesn't seem to be a great separation between
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:36.000]   rich and poor. And it's really quite striking how egalitarian the architecture is. And that's
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.240]   usually thought to be a reflection of social status. So it looks like, you know, could there
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.960]   have been a political revolution of some sort? They create, you know, something, you know,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.040]   something much more egalitarian, probably with kings, but, you know, a bunch of good guy kings
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:56.960]   who aren't interested in elevating themselves so much. Now, it isn't. And there's a whole chapter
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:03.600]   in the book by David Wingrow and David Graeber, The Dawn of Everything, about this. And they make
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:14.640]   this argument that, you know, Teotihuacan is, you know, an example that we can look at of an
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:21.680]   ancient society that was, you know, much more socially egalitarian than we think. Now, they,
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:26.080]   in my view, go a little overboard. It was also an aggressive imperial power, and it was conquering,
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:31.360]   you know, much of the Maya world at the same time. But it is absolutely true that something
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.000]   that started out one way starts looking very differently quite quickly. And you see this
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.160]   lots of times in the Americas. In the Southwest, you, I don't know if you've ever been to like
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:50.800]   Chaco Canyon or any of those places, can't tell you, you should absolutely go. Unfortunately,
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.040]   it's hard to get there because the road's terrible and so forth, but it's totally worth it. It's an
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:02.240]   amazing place and Mesa Verde right north of it is incredible. It's just really a fantastic thing to
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:08.000]   see. And there's these enormous structures there in Chaco Canyon that if there were anywhere else,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.960]   we would call them castles. They're huge. You have like 800, one of the biggest one,
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:17.040]   Pueblo Bonito has like 800 rooms or something, insane number like that. And, you know, it's
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:23.680]   clearly an imperial venture. And then we know that it's in this canyon and on one side, getting the
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.760]   good light and good sun is all these huge, there's a whole line of these huge castles. And on the
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:34.400]   other side is where, you know, the peons lived. We also know that starting, you know, around 1100,
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:42.080]   everybody just left. And then their descendants start the Pueblo who are this sort of intensely
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:49.200]   socially egalitarian type of people. And it looks like a political revolution took place. And in
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.000]   fact, in the book I'm now writing, I'm arguing that, you know, sort of tongue in cheek, but also
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.960]   seriously, that this is the first American revolution. It's they got rid of this, these,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:04.320]   these guys are kings, you know, or something and, and created these very different and much more
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.920]   egalitarian societies in which ordinary people had a much larger voice in what went on.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.080]   Interesting. But I wonder, I think I got a chance to see the Teotihuacan
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.680]   apartments when I was there. And I wonder if that the we're just looking at the buildings that
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.160]   survived, and the buildings that survive are maybe like better constructed, because they were for the,
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:34.160]   for like, the, those were the buildings were the elites, right. And then so like,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.440]   where everybody else lived, it just might have just washed away over the years.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.960]   So what's happened in the last 20 years is then, you know, basically much more sophisticated surveys
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.600]   of what is there, I mean, what you're saying is that the absolutely the right question to ask,
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.800]   you know, are the rich guys, you know, the only things that survived and the ordinary people
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:58.080]   didn't, and you can never be absolutely sure that, but what they have done is the kind of lidar and
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:04.400]   ground penetrating radar surveys. And it looks like this sort of more egalitarian construction
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.280]   extends for a huge distance. And so it's possible that there's even more really, really poor people
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.520]   with the thing, but at least you see the expand, you know, an aggressively large, quote, unquote,
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:19.280]   middle class getting there, which is very, very different than the kind of picture you have of
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.600]   the ancient world in which there's the sun priest or somebody, and then all the peasants around
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.680]   there. Yeah, yeah. But by the way, is the thesis of the new book something you're willing to disclose
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.680]   at this point? Okay, if you're not, okay. Okay, so the, this is sort of a, it's like a sequel or
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:41.200]   something or offshoot of 1491. And that book, I'm embarrassed to say was supposed to end with
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.880]   another chapter. And that chapter is going to be about the American West, which is where I grew up
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:51.920]   and, you know, I'm very fond of it. And apparently I had a lot to say, because when I outlined the
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:57.520]   chapter, the actual, the outline was way longer than the actual completed chapters of the rest of
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.800]   the book. And I sort of tried to chop it up and so forth, and it just was awful. And so I just cut it.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.680]   And if you carefully look at 1491, it doesn't really have an ending. It's just got at the end,
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:15.120]   the author sort of goes, Hey, I'm ending look at how great this is. And so this has been bothering
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.440]   me for 15 years. And so during the pandemic, you know, when I was stuck at home and like, like so
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:27.040]   many other people, I hauled out what I, what I had, and I've been saving string and, you know,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.360]   tossing articles that I came across into a folder. And I thought, okay, I'm going to write this out
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:38.320]   more seriously now, you know, 15 or 20 years later. And, and then it was, it was pretty long.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.000]   I thought maybe this could be an ebook and I showed it to my editor. And he said, that is
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.240]   not an ebook. That's an actual book. So I'm taking a chapter and I hope I just haven't padded it.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:56.000]   And it's about the North American West. And the something I've added is thinking about it is,
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:02.400]   you know, my, my kids liked the West and at various times they've, they've said, you know,
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.040]   what would it be like to move out there? Cause I'm in Massachusetts where they grew up. And
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.480]   so I started thinking about what is the West going to be like tomorrow, you know, in, you know, when
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.520]   I'm not around 30 or 50 years from now. And it seemed to me that you, we won't know who's president
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.760]   or who's governor or anything, but there's some things we can know. It'd be just a, really a
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:27.040]   surprise if it isn't, you know, hotter and drier than it is now, or it has been, you know, in the
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.520]   recent past. That would just be a really a surprise. So I think we can say that it's very likely to be
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:38.960]   like that. It would be a surprise if it wasn't, you know, all the projections are that something
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:45.920]   like 40% of the people in the area between the Mississippi and the Pacific will be of, you know,
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:53.040]   Latino descent, you know, from, from, from the South, so to speak. And there's a whole lot of
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:59.600]   people from Asia, you know, along the Pacific coast. So it's going to be a real mixing ground,
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:06.480]   ethnic mixing ground. And then there's going to be a center of energy, sort of, no matter what
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.960]   happens, you know, whether it's solar, whether it's wind, whether it's petroleum, you know,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.720]   hydroelectric, the West is, it's going to be economically extremely powerful,
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.240]   because energy is sort of the fundamental, you know, a fundamental industry. And the last thing
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.480]   is, and this is the most iffy of the whole thing, but I'm going to go out on a limb and do this,
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:32.000]   is say that the ongoing recuperation of sovereignty by the 294, I think, federally
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.360]   recognized Native nations in the in the West is going to continue. And what that's been going in
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.080]   this very jagged way, but definitely for the last 50 or 60 years, you know, as long as I've been
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:50.000]   around, it's the overall trend is in a very clear direction. And so then you think, okay, so this
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.640]   West is going to be wildly ethnically diverse, full of competing sovereignties and overlapping
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.280]   sovereignties, and nature is going to really be in kind of a turmoil. Well, that actually sounds
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:08.560]   like the 1200s. And the conventional history starts with Lewis and Clark, and so forth, and
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.440]   sort of says that there is this breakpoint in history, when you know, when people look like me,
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.240]   came in and sort of rolled in, and they roll in from the East and kind of take over everything,
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.000]   the West disappears as a separate entity, Native people disappear, nature is tamed.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.200]   And that's pretty much what was in the textbooks. When I was a kid, it was in,
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:32.560]   you know, do you know who Frederick Jackson Turner is? No, so he's like one of these
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.040]   guys who nobody knows who he is, but it was incredibly influential in setting intellectual
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:46.960]   ideas. He wrote this article in 1893, called the significance of the frontier. And it was the thing
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:52.080]   that established this idea that there is this frontier moving from East to West. And on this
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.360]   side was, you know, savagery or barbarism, and on this side was civilization, and tame nature and
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.400]   wilderness and all that. And it goes to the Pacific, and then that's the end of the West.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.840]   And that's still in the textbooks, you know, in different form. You know, we don't call Native
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:14.960]   people lurking savages like he did, you know, that sort of stuff. But it's in my kids textbooks,
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:20.160]   it's for if you have kids, it'll very likely be in their textbooks, it's such a bedrock thing.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:25.600]   I'm saying, that's actually not a useful way to look at it, given what's coming up. And there's a
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.760]   wonderful Texas writer, Bruce Sterling, who says, you know, to know the past, you first have to
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:40.640]   understand the future. And what he means is, it's funny, right? But what he means is, you know,
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:46.480]   all of us have an idea of where the trajectory of history is going. And a whole lot of history is
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.440]   saying, how did we get here? How did we get there? And to get that, you have to have an idea of what
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:57.520]   there is to do this. And so I'm saying, I'm writing a history of the West with that West,
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   you know, that I talked about in mind. And that gives you a very different picture. A lot more
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:09.840]   about, you know, indigenous fire management, and the way the Hohokam survived the drought of the
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   1200s. And a little bit less about Billy the Kid. I love that quote. Speaking of the frontier,
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:26.000]   maybe it's a mistaken concept. But I mean, let's stick with that for a second. I'm curious if you
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.160]   think that okay, so if you I remember the chapter of 1493, where you talk about, you know, these
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.840]   rowdy adventurous men who way outnumber the woman in the silver mines, the kind of trouble that they
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:46.240]   cause. I wonder if there's some sort of distant analogy to the technology world or Silicon Valley,
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.560]   where you have the same kind of gender ratio, you have the same kind of frontier spirit,
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.680]   maybe not the same kind of like physical violence, but sociologically, yeah,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.920]   sociologically, is there any similarity there? I think it's funny, I hadn't thought about it.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:06.960]   But so but it's certainly funny to think about. So let me do this sort of off the top of my head.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:12.880]   And then with the idea that if, if I start saying if I with the idea that at the end of it, I can
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:18.640]   say, wait a minute, that's ridiculous. Both of them would attract people who either didn't have
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:25.440]   much to lose, or were oblivious about what they what they had to lose, and kind of had a resilience
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.000]   towards failure. I mean, it's amazing the number of people in Silicon Valley who have like completely
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.200]   failed at numbers of things and just get up and keep, keep keep trying, and have a kind of real
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:47.840]   obliviousness to, to social norms. And it's pretty clear, and are very much interested in making a
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.520]   mark and making, you know, their fortunes themselves. So there's a, you know, at least in,
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.680]   you know, in this sort of shallow comparison, there's a, there's, there's some certain
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.160]   similarities. And I don't think this is entirely flattering to either groups.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:10.000]   You know, it is absolutely true that those silver miners in, in, in Bolivia, and in Northern,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.760]   Northern Mexico, you know, created, you know, to a large extent, the, the modern, modern world.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:22.080]   But it's also true that they created these sort of cesspools of violence and exploitation that,
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.080]   that, you know, that we're, that we're still, whose consequences we're still living with
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:31.440]   today. So you have to kind of take the bitter with the sweet. And I think that's true of
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.080]   Silicon Valley. And it's, it's, it's, it's products that I, I use them every day, and I curse them
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:47.840]   every day. Right. I want to give you an example. In my own thing, the, the, the internet has made
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.680]   it possible for me to do something like, you know, have a Twitter thread and have millions of people
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:56.400]   read it and, you know, and have a discussion. And that's really amazing. At the same time,
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:03.840]   yet today, the Washington Post is, has a, has an article about how every book in, I,
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:10.560]   I think it's Texas, it's one of the states, that a child checks out of the school library,
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:17.760]   goes into a central state databank. And, you know, and they can see and look for patterns of people
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:23.840]   taking out bad books and this sort of stuff. And I think like, whoa, that's really bad. That's not
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.960]   so good. And it's really the same technology that, you know, this dissemination and collection of
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.920]   information, vast amounts of information with relative ease. So, right, all these things,
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:38.960]   you take the bitter with the sweet. Yeah. I want to ask you again about the
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.880]   contingency thing, because there's so many other examples where things you thought would be
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:49.680]   universal actually don't turn out to be. I think the, you talk about how did the, the natives had
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:55.040]   like different forms of metallurgy, I think with gold and copper and things like that. But then
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:02.160]   they didn't do iron or steel. And you would think that given the warring nature of these, like iron
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.920]   would be such a huge help. And then like you, there's a clear incentive to build it. There's
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.640]   like millions of people living here who could have built or developed this technology. Same with the
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:19.120]   steel, I guess. I'm sorry. Sorry. Same with the same with the wheel. What was so like, what is
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.040]   the explanation for why these things you think anybody would have come up with? It just didn't
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.000]   happen? I know. It's just amazing to me. I don't know. And I, this is like one of those things,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:36.800]   like I think about all the time. A few weeks ago, it rained and I went out, I walked the dog. And
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.200]   I'm always amazed that you can, there's, there's literal, you know, glistening drops of water on
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:49.840]   the crabgrass and I, you know, you pick it up and sometimes there's little holes eaten by insects
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.520]   in the crabgrass. And every now and then, if you look carefully, you'll see a drop of water in that,
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:37:00.080]   in one of those holes. And it forms a lens, right? And you can look through it and you can see it's
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.520]   not a very powerful lens, but you can see it's magnified. And you think like, how long has there
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:13.040]   been crabgrass and, you know, or leaves and, and water just forever. We've had glass forever. How
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.480]   is it that we had to wait to Van Leeuwenhoek or whoever it was to, to create lenses. I just don't
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.920]   get it. Or, you know, in the book, 1491, I mentioned the moldboard plow, which is the one
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.880]   with a curving blade that allows you to go through the soil much more easily. Invented in China,
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.840]   you know, thousands of years ago, not, not around in Europe till the, till the 1400s. Like,
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:40.880]   come on guys, what was it? And so, you know, so there's this mysterious sort of mass stupidity
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:47.840]   that can, and one of the wonderful things about globalization and trade and contact and so forth
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.160]   is that maybe not everybody is, is as blind as you and you can, you can learn from them. I mean,
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.840]   that's the most wonderful thing about trade. So in the case of the wheel, I mean, the more
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.720]   amazing thing is like in Mesoamerica, they had the wheel. It was on, you know, child's toys.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.920]   Why did they develop it? And the best explanation I can get is they didn't have domestic animals.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:15.760]   And a cart then would have to be pulled by people. That would imply, to make the cart work,
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:21.040]   you'd have to cut a really good road. Whereas they did have travois, you know, the T-R-A,
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:28.160]   I'm not sure if I, travois, T-R-A-V-O-I-S, which are these things that you hold, and they have
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:33.600]   these skids that are shaped like, kind of like an upside down V, and you, you, they're, they're,
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:38.640]   you can drag them across rough ground. You don't need a road for them. And that's what, that's,
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:47.200]   that's what like people used in, in the great plains and, and, and, and so forth. So you look
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:54.000]   at this and you think like, maybe the ultimate labor savings was, I mean, this was good enough,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.920]   and you didn't have to build and maintain these roads to make this, this work, you know. So maybe
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   it was rational, or just maybe they're just blinkered. I don't, I don't know. And somebody
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:12.880]   with a steel, I think there's some values involved in that. I don't know if you've ever seen one of
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:20.720]   those sword-like things they had in Mesoamerica called maquitos. They're wooden clubs with
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:28.480]   obsidian blades on them, and they are sharp as hell. You know, they're like, don't run your
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.760]   finger along the edge because you'll just slice it open. And an obsidian blade is pretty much
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:42.320]   sharper than any, you know, iron or, or, or, or steel blade. And it doesn't rust nice, but it's
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:49.360]   much more brittle. Yeah, right. And so, so you say like, okay, they're, they're, the Spaniards
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:54.800]   were really afraid of them because a single blow from these, these heavy, sharp blades could kill
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.200]   a horse. I mean, they saw people like whack off the head of a horse with a, you know, big, strong
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:06.400]   guy with a single. So they're really dangerous, but they're not long lasting. And so part of the
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:14.160]   deal was that the values around conflict were different in that conflict in Mesoamerica,
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.960]   it wasn't a matter of sending out foot soldiers and, you know, grunts to, to go and get, it was
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:26.320]   a chance for, you know, soldiers to get individual glory and, and, and prestige. And this was
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.040]   associated with having these very elaborately beautiful weapons that you, you know, killed
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:38.560]   people, killed people with. And so maybe this worked, not having steel worked better for,
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.960]   for their values and what they were trying to do in, in war than it would have for Europe's. I
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:48.560]   mean, that's just a guess, but you can imagine a scenario in which it's not just blinkered,
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:53.520]   but an expressive of what those people were trying to do on the basis of their different values.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.200]   But this is hugely speculative. There's a wonderful book by Ross Hessig called
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:04.000]   Aztec Warfare, in which he, it's an amazing book, which is like a military history of the Aztecs.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.840]   It's really quite interesting. And he talks about this a little bit. And he finally just says,
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.240]   we don't know why they didn't, but this worked for them.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:15.440]   Interesting. Yeah, it's kind of similar to what do you think about China not developing gunpowder
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:22.480]   into an actual like ballistic thing? Or Japan giving up the gun, actually banning guns.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:28.800]   During the Edo period, they, the Portuguese introduced guns and the Japanese used them.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.760]   They said, ah, nope, don't want them. And they banned them. This turned out to be a terrible
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:40.720]   idea when Perry came in the 1860s. But for a long time, Japan, and there's this thing where
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:49.200]   supposedly, under the Edo period, Japan had the longest period of any nation ever without a foreign
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:59.200]   war. Hmm. Interesting. Interesting. May explain the Yeah, it's concerning when you think the lack
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.960]   of war might make you vulnerable in certain ways. Yeah, that's a depressing thought.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:09.440]   Right? Yeah. Fukuyama in the end of history, he's obviously arguing that we should just
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.680]   like liberal democracy will be the kind of the final form of government everywhere. But
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.120]   he has this like thing at the end where he's like, yeah, but maybe we need like a small war
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.760]   every 50 years just to make sure people remember how bad it can get and how to deal with it.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:30.400]   Anyways, so when the epidemic started in the new world, surely the Indians must have had
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.800]   some story, maybe it was like a superstitious explanation, but some way of like explaining
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.520]   what is happening? What was it like? Well, how did they come up with that? So you have to remember
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:45.360]   the germ theory of disease didn't exist at the time. So neither the Spaniards, or the English,
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:55.120]   or native people had a clear idea of what was going on. And in fact, both of them thought of
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:02.240]   it as essentially a spiritual event, you know, a religious event, you went into air, you know,
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.600]   areas that were bad. And you got, you know, in the air was bad. And that was malaria,
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.720]   malaria, right? That was an example. And it's so it was a, you know, and God is in control
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:19.520]   of the whole business. When the diseases came, there's a line from my distant ancestor,
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:25.040]   the Governor Bradford of Plymouth Colony, who's like, you know, umpteen, umpteen, umpteenth
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:33.280]   ground. That's how waspy I am. He's actually my ancestor is, is about how God saw fit to clear the
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:39.680]   natives for us. So he, you know, they see all of this in really religious terms, and more or less,
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:45.360]   native people did too. You know, they thought, you know, all over and over again, there's this
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:51.600]   thing like, we must have done something bad for this to have happened. And so this is a very
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:59.680]   powerful demoralizing thing. You know, your gods had either punished you or failed you. And this
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:04.800]   was a this, this is one of the reasons that Christianity was able to make inroads because
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.640]   interest, you know, people with their God was coming, and they seem to be less harmed by these
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:17.520]   diseases than people with our God. Now, both of them are completely misinterpreting what's going
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.480]   on. But, but, you know, if you have that kind of spiritual explanation, it makes sense for you to
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.960]   say, think, well, maybe, maybe I should adopt their God. Yeah, yeah, this is fascinating.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.040]   There's been a lot of books written in the last few decades about why civilizations collapse,
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.920]   you know, there's, there's just a dangerous book, there's your diamonds book. Do you feel like any
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.320]   of them actually do a good job of explaining how these different Indian societies collapsed over
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:47.840]   time? No, well, not the ones that I've read. And the reason there's two reasons for that.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:56.320]   One is, I mean, it's not really a mystery. If you have a society that's epidemiologically naive,
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:03.920]   and, you know, smallpox sweeps in kills 30% of you, you know, measles kills in kills a 10% of
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:10.240]   you. And this all happens in a short period of time. That's, you know, that's really tough. I
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:15.360]   mean, look, what COVID killed one, you know, million people in the United States, that's one
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:22.240]   330th of the population. And it wasn't even particularly, you know, the most economically
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:28.400]   vital part of the population wasn't, yeah, wasn't kids, it was, you know, elderly people, like my
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:33.440]   aunt, you know, so I don't, I hope I'm not sounding callous when I'm describing it like a
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:41.760]   demographer. And, because, you know, I don't mean it that way. But it caused enormous, you know,
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.720]   economic damage, and, you know, social conflict, and so forth. Now imagine something that's, you
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:53.840]   know, 30 or 40 times worse than that, and you have no explanation for it at all. It's kind of not a
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:46:00.400]   surprise to me that this is a super challenge. What's actually amazing is the number of nations
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:08.800]   that survived and came up with ways to deal with this incredible loss. And that goes to the second
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:14.720]   issue, which is that it's sort of weird to talk about collapse in ways that you sometimes do,
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:20.400]   like, both of them talk about the Maya collapse. But there's 40, 30 million Maya people still
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:27.840]   there. They were never really conquered by the Spaniards. The Spaniards are still waging giant
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:37.520]   wars in Yucatan in the 1590s. You know, when you go, one time, this is now in the, in the early
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:46.800]   21st century, I went with my son to Chiapas, which is the southernmost Mexican province. And that is
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:52.240]   where you probably heard about the Comandante Zero. And, you know, there's rebellions are going
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:58.160]   on. And we were looking at some Maya ruins, and they're too beautiful. And I stayed too long. We
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:04.880]   were driving back through the night on these terrible roads. And we got stopped by some of
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:11.520]   these guys with guns. And I was like, Oh, God, you know, not only have I, you know, got myself
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.800]   into this, I got my son into this. And the guy comes and he looks at us and says, Who are you?
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:18.720]   And I say that we're American tourists. And he just gets look this disgusted. Look, he says,
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:25.120]   go on. And I said, Wait a minute. You know what, you know, the journalist to me takes over and
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:31.040]   said, Well, what do you mean? Just go on. And he says, We're hunting for Mexicans. And I drive
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:39.680]   about my head. Wait a minute. I'm in Mexico. And that those are Maya. You know, all those guys
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:47.200]   were Maya people still fighting against the Spaniards. So it's kind of funny to say that
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.960]   their society collapsed when they have, you know, their Maya radio stations, their Maya schools,
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.440]   their, you know, their people speaking by in their home. It's true, they don't have giant
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:02.720]   castles in anymore. But it's, you know, it's odd to think of that as collapse, they seem like
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:08.880]   highly successful people who have dealt pretty well with a lot of foreign incursions. So there's
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:15.600]   this whole aspect of what do you mean collapse? And you see that in against the grain, the James
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.840]   Scott book, where, you know, what do you mean, barbarians, these guys have a pretty good.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:27.920]   And, you know, if you're an average Maya person, you know, you know, working as a farmer under
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:34.080]   these, the purview of these elites in the big cities, probably wasn't all that great.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:39.440]   And after collapse, you were probably better off. So, you know, so all of that, I feel like,
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:47.360]   is important in this discussion of collapse. And I think it's hard to point to
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:57.760]   collapses that don't either have very clear exterior causes, or are, you know, really
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:03.600]   collapses of the environment, and particularly the environmental sort that that are pictured in
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.960]   books like Diamonds Collapse. He talks like Easter Island. And the striking thing about that is we
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.800]   know pretty much what happened to all those trees. Easter Island is this little speck of land,
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:18.000]   you know, in the middle of the ocean, Dutch guys come there, it's the only wood around,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.280]   you know, forever, they cut down all the trees to use it for boat repair,
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   ship repair. And, and they enslave most of the people who are living there. And we
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.360]   know pretty much what happened. There's no mystery about it.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:36.880]   Why did the British government and the king keep subsidizing and giving sanction to the Virginia
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.840]   Company, even after it was clear that this is not especially profitable? And basically,
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.520]   like half the people that are going are dying? Why didn't they just like stop?
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:51.440]   That's a really good question. That's a super good question. I don't really know if we have
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:56.400]   a satisfactory answer, because it was so stupid for them to keep doing that. It was such a loss
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:07.040]   for so so long. So you have to say, they were thinking not purely economically. And part of it
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:15.280]   is the the backers of the Virginia Company in sort of classic VC style, when things are going bad,
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:21.600]   they lied about it. And they and they're burning through their cash. They did these rosy presentations.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:27.840]   And they said, it's gonna be great. We just need this extra money. You know, kind of the way that
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:33.920]   Uber did was, you know, and then there's this tremendous burn rate. And now the company's
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:38.240]   tremendous trouble because these, it turns out that it's really expensive to provide all these
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:44.720]   calves and, and do all this stuff. And the cheaper prices that made me people like me really happy
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:51.840]   about it, are vanishing. So, you know, I think future business studies will look at those rosy
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.000]   presentations from Uber and see that they have a kind of analogy to the ones that were done with
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:07.600]   the Virginia Company. A second thing is that there was this dogged belief, kind of based on,
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:17.360]   you know, inabilities to understand longitude and, and, and so forth, that the
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:24.800]   Americas were far narrower than they actually are. And there's a, I think I reproduced this
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.760]   in 1493. There's, there's all kinds of maps in Britain at the time, showing this little skinny,
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.840]   you know, Philippines like islands. And there's a thought that, you know, you just go up the
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.760]   Chesapeake, and you go just a couple hundred miles, and you're going to get to the Pacific
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:43.920]   and to China. So there's this constant searching for a passage to China through this, thought to
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:48.640]   be very narrow. And Sir Francis Drake and people like that had shown that there was a West Coast.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.680]   And so they thought the whole thing was this, you know, narrow Panama-like inlet. And so there's,
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:52:02.000]   so there's this geographical confusion. And finally, there's the fact that the Spaniards
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.360]   had found all this gold and silver, which is an ideal commodity, because it's not perishable. It's
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:11.920]   small, you can put it on your ship and bring it back. And it's, it's just great in every way.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:17.600]   It's money, essentially, they, you dig up money in the hills. And there's this longstanding belief,
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:23.680]   there's got to be more of that. And in the Americas, we just need to find out. So there's
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:29.040]   always that hope. And finally, there's this kind of imperial bragging rights. You know,
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:35.440]   we can't be the only guys in a colony. And you see that with, with, you know, later in the 19th
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.160]   century, with, you know, Germany becomes a nation. And one of the first things that does is, you
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:46.480]   know, looks for pieces of Africa that, that, that the rest of Europe hasn't, hasn't claimed and,
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:51.120]   and sets up its own, you know, mini colonial empire. So there's this kind of keeping up with
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:59.680]   the Joneses aspect. It just seems to be sort of deep in the European ruling class, that you got
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:07.120]   to have an empire, you know, in this weird way that, you know, seems very culturally part of it.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:13.040]   And I guess it's the same for many other places. As soon as you get, as soon as you feel like you
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:18.240]   have a state together, you want to annex other things. And you see that over and over again,
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:24.080]   all over the world. So, so that's part of it. So all those things, I think, contribute to it,
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:29.600]   this out and outlying, this delusion and various delusions plus hubris.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:38.000]   Yeah, it seems, it seems that the colonial envy has probably today spread to China. I don't know
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.520]   too much about it. But I hear that the Silk Road stuff they're doing is not especially economically
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:49.440]   wise. It just, but it is this kind of like, you have this impulse, if you're a nation trying to
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.200]   rise that, you know, I got to go, I got to go over there, I got to go over there.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.840]   So what a big guy I am. Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:02.640]   Speaking of China, and speaking of silver, I want to ask you about the silver trade. So
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.440]   excuse another tortured analogy. But when I was reading that chapter where you're describing how
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.920]   the Spanish silver was ending up in China, you know, I'm reading this, and I'm looking at you're
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:17.520]   describing how the Ming dynasty, it caused too much inflation, there were people needed a reliable
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:25.120]   medium of exchange. And then they had to give up real goods from China, just in order to get this
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.640]   silver, which is just a medium of exchange. It's not it's not creating more apples, right?
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:35.760]   And I was thinking about this, I was like, this sounds a bit like Bitcoin today, in the sense,
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:43.840]   obviously to a much smaller magnitude, but in the sense that you're using up goods, like, I mean,
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:48.160]   it's a small amount of electricity, all things considered, but like, you're having to use up like,
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:53.920]   real energy in order to construct this medium of exchange. And maybe somebody can claim that this
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:00.240]   is necessary because of inflation or some other policy mistake, like you can compare to like Ming
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:05.760]   dynasty or something. But what do you think this analogy, basically, that there's a similar thing
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:09.680]   where real goods are being exchanged for just medium exchange? That's really interesting.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.560]   I mean, on some level, that's the way that money works, right? You know, I go into a store,
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.800]   and I, you know, Starbucks, and I buy a coffee, and I hand them a piece of paper with some
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:23.600]   drawings on it. And they give they hand me an actual coffee in return for a piece of paper.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:29.360]   So, you know, so that the mysteriousness of money is kind of amazing. And there's histories,
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:34.160]   of course, replete with examples of things that people took very seriously as money that to us
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:40.400]   seems very silly, like the cowrie shell, or in the island of Yap, you know, where they had giant
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   stones. And those are money, and nobody ever carried them around, you transfer the ownership
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.360]   of the stone from one person to another person to buy something. So you know, I would get some
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:57.520]   coconuts or gourds or whatever. And now you own that stone on the hill. So there's a tremendous
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:03.840]   sort of mysteriousness about the human willingness to assign value to arbitrary things such as in
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:12.880]   Bitcoin's case, strings of zeros and ones. So that part of it make sense to me. What the
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:21.680]   extraordinary thing is that when the effort to create a medium of exchange ends up costing you
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:26.160]   significantly, which is what you're talking about, and we're talking about in China, where
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:35.680]   people got a medium exchange, but they had to work hugely to get the money. I don't have to
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.880]   work hugely to get a dollar bill, right? To get the dollar bill. It's not like I'm, you know,
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:46.560]   cutting down a tree and, you know, smashing the papers to pulp and, you know, printing this.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:52.560]   You're right. And that's what they're kind of doing in China. And that's to a lesser extent,
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:58.480]   what you're doing in Bitcoin. So I hadn't thought about this. And the Bitcoin in this case is using
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:08.320]   computer cycles and energy. And to me, it's absolutely extraordinary. The degree to which
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:15.040]   people are, who are Bitcoin miners are willing to upend their lives to get cheap energy. So
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:23.200]   a guy I know is talking about setting up small nuclear plants, you know, as part of his idea
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:29.200]   for climate change. And to set them up, he wants to set them up in like really weird remote areas.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.760]   And I was saying, who would be your customers? And he said, Bitcoin people would move to these
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:40.160]   nowhere places so they could have like these pocket nukes to privately supply their Bitcoin
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:48.160]   habits. And I just thought, that is really crazy to, you know, completely upend your life for to
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.760]   create something that you hope is a medium of exchange that will allow you to buy the things
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:58.720]   that you're giving up. Right. And so there's a kind of funny aspect to this. And that was partly
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:04.640]   what was happening in China is that they were, unfortunately, China is very large. And so they
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:10.720]   were able to send off all this stuff to Mexico so that they could get the silver to pay their taxes.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:16.960]   But it was definitely weak in the country. Yeah, well, actually, the thing you're talking about,
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:22.480]   in some sense, it's El Salvador actually tried it, they were trying to set up a Bitcoin city
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.400]   next to this volcano, or they were going to use the, I guess, a geothermal from the
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:32.480]   volcano in order to like, make people come there to mine cheap Bitcoin, or mine it cheaply.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:38.000]   Staying on the theme of China, do you think the profits were more correct or the wizards
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.880]   more correct for that given time period? Because you have the introduction of as you describe them
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:49.040]   in the book, potato, corn, maize, sweet potatoes, and then this drastically increases population,
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:53.040]   but then again, it reaches a carrying capacity. So and then obviously, there's other kinds of
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:59.600]   ecological problems as causes as you describe in the book. So it is this is this you think,
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:05.200]   at that time, evidence of the wizard worldview that you have this potato and then, you know,
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.720]   the population balloons or is that are the profits like, Oh, no, no, the carrying capacity
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:14.560]   will catch up to us eventually. Okay, so let me interject here. For those members of your audience
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:19.040]   who don't know what we're talking about. I wrote this book, The Wizard and the Prophet. And there's
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:24.000]   about these sort of two camps that have been around for a long time, regarding about how we
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.520]   think about energy resources, the environment and all those issues. And the wizards, you know,
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:36.560]   you can call them, that's my name for them. Stewart Brand calls them druids. And, which is,
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:41.360]   in fact, originally, the title was going to be involved the word druid, but they, my editor said,
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:48.960]   nobody knows what a druid is. So I had to change it to wizards. Anyway, you know, say that science
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.200]   and technology properly applied can allow you to produce your way out of these environmental
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:56.720]   deliverance, you turn on the science machine, essentially, and we can, you know, we can escape
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:01.920]   these kind of dilemmas. And the prophets say, no, there's there's there that natural systems are
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:08.720]   governed by laws. And there's an inherent carrying capacity or limits or planetary boundaries, or,
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:12.960]   you know, there's a bunch of different names for them that say that you can't do more than so much.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:22.160]   And so what happened in China is that European crops came over and China's basic one of China's
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:29.760]   sort of basic geographical conditions is it's, you know, something like 20% of the Earth's,
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.600]   you know, habitable surface area, or it has 20% of the world's population, excuse me,
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.000]   has a, you know, appreciable chunk of the world's surface area, but it only has seven or 8%
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   of the world's above ground freshwater. There's no big giant lakes like we have in the Great Lakes.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   And there's only a couple of big rivers, the Yangtze and the Huanghe or Yellow River.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.560]   And the main staple crop in China has to be grown in swimming pools, that's, you know, rice. And so
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:02.480]   there's this paradox, which is, how do you keep people fed with rice in a country that has very
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:08.720]   little water? And, you know, if you want a shorthand history, history of China, that's it,
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:15.360]   it's okay. And prophets believe that there's these planetary boundaries. And so, in history,
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.240]   these are typically called Malthusian limits after Malthus. And the, you know, the question
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.280]   is, with the available technology at a certain time, you know, how many people can you feed
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.240]   before there's misery? And the great thing about history, and this sort of thing is it provides
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:36.080]   evidence for both sides. Because in the short run, what happened when American crops come in,
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:42.880]   is that the potato, the sweet potato and maize, corn, are the first staple crops
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:50.080]   that are dry land crops that can be grown in the western half of China, which is very, very dry and
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:59.840]   mountainous and has little water. And population soars immediately afterwards. But so does social
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:10.560]   unrest, misery, and so forth. In the long run, it becomes adaptable, and China becomes as wealthy
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:15.280]   and powerful, a powerful nation in the short run, which is not so short as a couple of centuries,
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:23.760]   it's, it really causes tremendous chaos and suffering. So, which, you know, it provides
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.400]   evidence, if you like, for both sides. One is increases human capacity. And the second,
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:33.520]   unquestionably about it increases human numbers, increases the possibility. The second is it leads
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:42.240]   to tremendous erosion, land degradation and human suffering. Yeah, that's that's a thick coin with
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:48.880]   the two sides. But by the way, so I realized I haven't gotten to all the wizard and prophet
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:54.080]   questions. And there's a lot of them. So I certainly have, you know, time, I'm enjoying
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:00.320]   the conversation. One of the weird things is that about podcasts, is that as far as I can tell,
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:06.320]   the average podcast interviewer that is far more knowledgeable, and thoughtful than the average
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:11.920]   sort of mainstream journalist interviewer that I just find that amazing. I don't just don't
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.920]   understand it. So I think you guys should be hired by the, you know, they should switch roles or
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:22.480]   something. So yeah, maybe it's a pleasure to be asked these interesting questions about subjects
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:28.000]   I find fascinating. It's my pleasure to get to talk to you and to have a good get to ask these
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.760]   questions. So this will let me ask about the wizard and the prophet. So one of I just recently
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:39.360]   had Will McCaskill, and he's okay, so you're familiar. And then we were talking about what
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.040]   ends up mattering most in history. And I asked him, you know, like Norman Borlaug, it said that
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:51.040]   he saved a billion lives. But then McCaskill pointed out that that while that's an exceptional
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:57.040]   result, that he doesn't think the technology is that contingent. So if Borlaug hadn't existed,
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.120]   somebody else would have discovered what he discovered about, you know, short wheat stalks
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:07.200]   anyways. And then so counterfactually, in a world where Borlaug doesn't exist, it's not like a
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.840]   billion people die, maybe a couple million more die until the next guy comes around. That's what
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.840]   that was his view. What would you do? Do you agree? Or what is your response? And to some extent, I,
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:25.840]   I agree, you know, it's, it's, it's very likely that, you know, in the absence of one scientist,
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.320]   some other scientist would have discovered this. And I mentioned in the book, in fact,
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:40.560]   that there's a guy named Swaminathan is a remarkable Indian scientist who is kind of,
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:46.880]   you know, a step behind him, you know, and, and, you know, did, did much of the same work. And,
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:53.760]   you know, at the same time, the individual qualities of Borlaug are really quite remarkable.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:59.040]   I mean, the, the amount, the insane amount of work and dedication that he, that he did,
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:08.640]   is really hard to imagine. And the fact is that he was going against many of the breeding,
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.800]   plant breeding dogmas of his day, that all, and that all matters in his insistence on
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:20.960]   feeding the poor, you know, there was a, that was a, so he did remarkable things. Yes, I think some
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.400]   of those same things would have been discovered, would have been a huge deal if it had taken 20
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.520]   years later. I mean, that would have been a lot of people who would have been hurt in the, in the
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:36.320]   interim, because at the same time, things like the end of colonialism and the discovery of antibiotics
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:43.600]   and so forth has, was leading to a real population rise. And the amount of human misery that would
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:52.160]   have occurred is really frightening to, to, to, to think about. So, in some sense, I think he's,
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.960]   he's right, but I wouldn't be so glib about those couple of million people.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:04.080]   Yeah. And, and another thing you might be concerned about is that given the hostile
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:09.040]   attitude that people had towards the Green Revolution right after, like, if, if the,
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:15.040]   if the actual implementation of these, these restraints in Pakistan and India, if that hadn't
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:19.520]   been delayed, it's, it's not that weird to imagine a scenario where the government there are just
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:25.360]   like, totally won over by the profits and they're, they decide not to implant this technology at all.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.600]   If you think about like, what happened to nuclear in the 70s, in many different countries, right?
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.440]   Like maybe something similar could have happened to, maybe something similar could have happened
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.840]   to the Green Revolution. So right, it's important, it's important to beat the profit. Maybe that's
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:41.760]   not the right, correct way to say it, but one way you could put it is, it's important like to beat
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.200]   the profits, but like before the policies are passed, you have to like get the technology in
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.960]   there. You're right. Or else you want, you know, you want to listen to the, you know, in my opinion,
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.200]   this is just my personal opinion, you want to listen to the profits about what the problems are.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:01.040]   They're incredible about diagnosing problems. And very frequently, they're right about those
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:05.760]   things. There's the social issues about the Green Revolution, dead right. They're completely right.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:11.520]   I don't know if you then adopt their solutions. It's a little bit like my feeling with my
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.760]   editors. My editors often will point out problems, but I almost never agree with their solution.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:23.280]   But they're correct about the diagnoses. You know, the fact is that Borlaug did develop this
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:29.600]   wheat that came into India, but it's also a fact that it probably wouldn't have been nearly as
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:37.840]   successful as Swaminathan hadn't changed that wheat to make it more acceptable to the culture
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:43.760]   of India. That was one of the most important parts for me of this book was when I went to Tamil Nadu
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:49.520]   and I listened to this and I thought, oh, I never heard about this part where they took Mexican
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.920]   wheat and they made it into Indian wheat. You know, I don't even know if Borlaug ever knew
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.160]   they really grasped that they really had done that. By the way, a person for you to interview
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:08.080]   is Marcy Baranski. She's got a forthcoming book about the history of the Green Revolution.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:13.600]   She sounds great. I'm really looking forward to reading it. So here's a plug for her.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:23.040]   So if we apply that particular story to today, let's say that we had regulatory agencies like
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:29.280]   the FDA back then that were as powerful back then as they are now. Do you think it's possible that
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:34.800]   these new advances would have just dithered in some approval process that took years or
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:44.160]   decades to complete? If you just backtest our current process for implementing technological
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.320]   solutions, are you concerned that something like the Green Revolution could not have happened or
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.400]   would have taken way too long or something? It's possible. I mean, you know, bureaucracies can
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:59.920]   always go rogue, and government is faced with this kind of impossible problem. So let us take,
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:08.000]   for example, there's a current big political argument about whether the former President
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:16.640]   Trump should have taken these documents, you know, top secret documents to his house in Florida and
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:22.080]   done whatever he wanted to. And let us say, just for the moment, let's accept the argument that
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.600]   these were like super secret documents and should not have been in a basement. Let's just say that's
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:34.240]   true. But we don't have, and he says, well, whatever the President says is declassified
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.640]   is declassified. And let us say that's true. I mean, I don't know. I'm just talking about it
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   as a paper. Obviously, that would be bad. You would not want to have that kind of informal process
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.240]   if, or you can imagine all kinds of things that you wouldn't want to have that kind of informal
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:53.520]   process in place. But nobody has ever imagined that you would do that because it's sort of nutty
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:10:01.760]   in that scenario. And so then you say you write a law and you create a bureaucracy for declassifying.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:09.840]   And immediately, you add more, you know, delay, you make things harder, you add in the problems of
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:17.760]   the bureaucrats getting too much power, you know, all the things that you do. So you have this
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.640]   problem with government, which is that people occasionally do things you would never imagine
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:29.040]   as completely screwy. And so then you put in regulatory mechanisms to stop them from doing
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:35.200]   that. And that impedes everybody else. And so in the case of the FDA, it was founded in the 30s when
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.920]   some person produced this thing called elixir sulfanamide that killed hundreds of people,
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:46.400]   was a flat out poison. And, you know, hundreds of people died. You think like, who would do that?
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.280]   But somebody did that. And they created this entire review mechanism to make sure it never
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.800]   happened again, which introduced delay. And then something with thalidomide, you know, which they
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:03.360]   did stop here because, you know, the people who invented that didn't even do the most cursory kind
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:12.000]   of check. So you have this constant problem. So I'm sympathetic to the dilemma faced by government
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.760]   here, in which you either let through really bad things done by the occasional people or you screw
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.480]   up everything for everybody else. And, you know, it's kind of like this. I was phrasing it crudely,
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.360]   but I think you see the kind of tradeoff. So the question is, how well can you manage this tradeoff?
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:32.080]   And so I would argue that sometimes it's well managed and sometimes it's not. Like,
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:38.240]   it's kind of remarkable that we got vaccines produced by an entirely new mechanism,
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:44.560]   you know, in record time, and they passed pretty rigorous safety reviews and they were given to
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.120]   millions and millions and millions of people with very, very few negative effects. I mean,
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:53.680]   that's a real regulatory triumph there, right? So that would be the counter example. You know,
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:12:00.080]   you have this new thing that you can feed people and so forth, and they let it through very quickly.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:07.120]   On the other hand, you have things like genetically modified salmon and trees, which,
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:13.840]   as far as I can tell, they've done, especially for the chestnuts, extraordinary efforts to test.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:17.840]   And I'm sure that those are going to be in regulatory hell for years to come.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:27.120]   So, you know, I just feel like there's this great problem in that the flaws that you identify,
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.680]   I would like to back up and say this is a problem sort of inherent to government.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:40.080]   And, you know, they're always protecting us against the edge case, and the edge case sets
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:45.760]   the rules. And that ends up, you know, unless you're very careful, making it very difficult
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:52.080]   for everybody else. Yeah. And the vaccines are an interesting example here, because
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:56.560]   one of the things you talk about in the book, one of the possibilities with regards to climate change
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.960]   is that you could have some kind of geoengineering. And I think you mentioned in the book that, well,
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.160]   as long as it could just be like, if even one country tries this, then they can effectively for
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:11.840]   relatively modest amount of money, they could change the atmosphere. But then I look at
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:16.880]   the failure of any government to approve human challenge trials. Yes, something that seems like
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.360]   an obvious thing to do, and would have would have potentially saved hundreds of thousands
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.360]   of lives during COVID by speeding up the vaccine approval. And then I wonder, maybe the collaboration
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:32.320]   among the international collaboration is strong enough that something like geoengineering actually
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.520]   couldn't happen because something like human challenge trials didn't happen.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:41.600]   So let me give a plug here for a fun novel by my friend, Neil Stevenson, called Termination Shock,
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:50.080]   which is about some rich person just doing it, just doing geoengineering. And the fact that it's
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:56.720]   actually not against the law to fire off rockets into the stratosphere. In his case, it's a giant
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:04.560]   gun that shoots shells full of sulfur into the upper atmosphere. And I guess the question is,
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:12.320]   what timescale do you think is appropriate for all this? I feel quite confident that there will be
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:23.840]   geoengineering trials within the next 10 years. Is that fast enough? That's a real judgment call.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.320]   I think people like David Keith and the other advocates for geoengineering would have said it
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.080]   should have happened already. And that's way, way too slow. People who are super anxious about moral
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.520]   hazard and precautionary principles say that's way, way too fast. So you have these different
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:46.000]   constituencies. So it's hard for me to think off the top of my head of an example where these
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.680]   regulatory agencies have actually totally throttled something in a long lasting way,
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:56.800]   as opposed to delaying it for 10 years. 10 years, I don't mean to imply that that's nothing.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:02.000]   But really killing off something. Is there an example you can think of?
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:09.440]   It's very dependent on where you think it would have been otherwise. People say maybe
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:15.520]   it was just bound to be the state. I think in that case, that was a very successful case.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:29.120]   As far as I can tell of regulatory capture, in which the opponents of the technology successfully
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:39.200]   created this crazy... So one of the weird things about nuclear stuff, this is not actually in the
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.000]   book. I actually wrote a whole long section about it in the book and I cut it out because it felt
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:50.800]   like it was just too much in the weeds. If you have a coal plant, they have environmental rules
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:57.200]   and the rules are based on a threshold principle that you set a safe threshold for the emission of
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:03.840]   particulates and other things. And as long as you're below that threshold, you're fine.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:12.320]   Nuclear power has a thing for its main type of pollution, which is radiation. It's called the
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:17.840]   linear no threshold model. And what it says is that you have to reduce radiation to the maximum
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:27.600]   extent practicable. And that is set by essentially, if your nuclear power is way cheaper than coal
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.880]   power, which it is, that means you have more profits so that you can spend more money on
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.600]   reducing it. And so you're going ever further on the road to diminishing returns. So you have a
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:43.600]   completely different regulatory standard for nuclear, I'm talking about this country, than you
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:48.720]   do for coal. And so you have this bizarre fact that coal power plants emit more radiation than
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.200]   nuclear plants do because of the residual radiation in the coal that's dug up from underneath the
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:17:03.840]   earth. And so there you have a very strange case of regulatory capture in which you have a completely
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.040]   inconsistent set of safety standards across different parts of the same industry. And the
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.760]   question to me, and sort of an empirical question, is how common is that? Or is that this weird thing
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:20.400]   that's happened to nuclear? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so assume that you're, let's say you're in the 1960s
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:25.760]   and that you are a philanthropic donor who is interested, let's say you're like the 1960s
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:29.760]   version of an effective altruist, you're interested in doing the most good possible.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:34.320]   And in retrospect, it's clear that you should have funded Borlaug. I mean, counterfactually,
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.560]   he still does it. But you know, let's just say, his work depends on your funding.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:45.200]   What, like, how could you have identified work like that? Is there some criteria
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.160]   that is broadly applicable where you could have identified his work in Mexico using it?
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:56.320]   That's a really good question. I mean, that's the greatest good for greatest number question.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:02.800]   And to do that, you would have to say, what are the biggest problems facing the planet? And then,
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.720]   presumably, if you're William McCaskill, or somebody like that, you say all lives are equal.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:12.320]   And so what is the thing that's most affecting the most number of lives? In that case, it's probably
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:23.600]   clean drinking water. Right? I think that's the biggie. And that means funding primarily urban
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:30.480]   infrastructure for water and setting up some kind of foundation or some independent agency that's
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:35.280]   not insulated, that's insulated from government to actually keep those water systems going.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:42.960]   That would be my answer on that. Which would be, that's how you would do it. I think you would try
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.400]   to figure out, you know, what are the bare necessities? What's killing more people than
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:52.640]   anything else? And in 1960, it's probably food and water. And so food is actually,
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.480]   the Food and Agricultural Organization, once they get interested in boardwalk,
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.720]   actually does a pretty good job of promoting it. And there's the creation of the Seaguar system,
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:06.240]   it could always use more water is completely neglected. And actually, I would I would
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:11.920]   channel it towards water. Interesting. Okay. I want to know,
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:18.160]   I'm going to name two trends. And I want to know what you think these two imply for the debate
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:25.120]   between wizards and prophets in the future. So one of the trends is declining researcher productivity
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:30.000]   in terms of how many new important advancements each researcher is able to make. There's evidence
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.320]   that shows that that's like exponentially decaying. I think that's wrong. I think that's wrong that
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:42.800]   they think. And the reason is that, you know, in the areas that I'm familiar with, you know,
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:50.720]   there's two things that are going on. One is like in particle physics. It's harder and harder to
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:57.200]   make discoveries because you're a penalty of your own success. You're pushing harder and harder
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:03.520]   and do things. And to really get to where you're going, it's just incredibly expensive. So that's
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:07.760]   a natural phenomenon. It's not anything really to worry about, because, you know, what do you want
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:13.840]   to do? Undo the past 50 years of success in particle physics. People like Murray Gell-Mann could
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.440]   do a huge amount because there's not there. We didn't know anything. So you're seeing just plain
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:22.400]   old diminishing. The second thing, though, and I think is is something important, is that it feels
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:29.440]   like agricultural research, the vast majority of research is in a bunch of narrow areas, wheat,
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:36.560]   rice, maize and so forth. There's all kinds of alternative crops that could be that are hardly
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.160]   looked at and could be really important, particularly in a time of climate change,
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:46.800]   when we are going to have to have a much more resilient and varied agricultural system to deal
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.880]   with the uncertainties of climate change. So I'd like to there's hardly any research done in
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:56.560]   agroforestry. All those crops are essentially wild. You know, how many people are, you know,
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:00.640]   except for William Powell looking at chestnut, there's practically no real genetic research into
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:07.120]   increasing tree crop productivity. There's also not nearly enough research in even, you know,
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:13.680]   things like cassava where you could, you know, do a huge amount because there's just I always tell
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:18.080]   when I talk to people, I always say, go to these other crops. They're really, really important.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.440]   They're going to be even more important in the future. And there's virtually no research on them.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.560]   And you can make giant strides rather than being the person who's trying to increasingly optimize
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.680]   wheat, something that's already been optimized by 10,000 people. So part of it is that there is this
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:37.120]   channeling of people into fields that are already well trodden. And I think that you can see that in
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:43.280]   many, many areas of research, that would be a partial answer to that question.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:50.400]   I see. Yeah. So I was going to ask if there's declining research productivity, maybe there's
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:55.120]   less rabbits who can just keep pulling out of the hat like Borlau did. But let me just ask instead,
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:02.160]   or similarly, with regards to increasing the productivity of trees in order to potentially
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:09.040]   deal with climate change. What in the book you speculate about C4 photosynthesis, you know?
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.680]   That's just an example of the kind of thing that you could do.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:14.640]   What is the status of that? Are you optimistic about that?
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:20.880]   Yeah, they're plugging away. It's a huge, difficult problem, but it's extraordinarily
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:26.480]   interesting. And to get something like C4 rice would be just an absolutely gigantic
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:35.200]   increase in productivity. But even in drylands areas, there's this method of agriculture that's
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.800]   used in West Africa and places like Northern Mexico, which is silvopestoral, where you have
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:48.320]   ruminants, cows, and so forth, and trees. And to create a system that is way easier on the land,
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:57.040]   uses way less water, and is almost as productive as annual crops. And almost no research has gone
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:01.760]   into that. That would be another example of a kind of thing that you could do that I would argue
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:10.320]   would have a much greater impact than the person trying to get the latest cherry-flavored
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.280]   nose drops or something, which is what a huge amount of research is in.
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.280]   There have been people speculating recently that environmental contaminants
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:25.840]   are leading to a host of bad outcomes in health in the West, especially obesity.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.840]   How plausible do you think this is?
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:34.080]   I guess I always wonder about the mechanism. What would be the mechanism that these tiny
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:40.560]   trace amounts of these compounds have in them? And how come, as our environment has generally
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:46.400]   gotten cleaner, obesity has risen? So I'm immediately skeptical of this. One of the
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.920]   issues here is that you're dealing with problems that are on the very limits of our ability to
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:55.520]   measure them. If you're looking for these things, obviously they have very, very long-term effects,
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:03.280]   whatever they are. How are you going to actually ascertain that? And people who make very strong
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:10.080]   claims based on effects without a mechanism that are at the very limits of our ability to measure,
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:20.240]   that just doesn't seem all that promising to me. It's not impossible, but the claims you see,
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.480]   I think, how could they possibly know that?
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.800]   Yeah. So one of these people, they're good friends of mine, Slime Old Time Old,
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.600]   they're anonymous bloggers on the internet, and they set up something called the potato diet.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.800]   It was like a four-week study. And I thought you might have interesting thoughts on this,
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.960]   given the chapters in your book that were dedicated to the humble potato and its impact on
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:45.440]   the world. So basically, they only ate potatoes for four weeks. And as you talk about in the book,
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.920]   potatoes have a bunch of micronutrients that-
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.360]   They're weirdly good for you. If you're going to do that, use potatoes. Yeah.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.880]   Yeah. And then people lost a lot of weight. So is this something you would have expected?
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:02.000]   What do you think of this, just recapitulating Irish history?
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.360]   Well, the Irish history is both analogous and not analogous, because it is true,
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:11.360]   they ate nothing but it. But also, those people were super vigorously physically
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.800]   exercising because they were out in the fields with really poor tools. So
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:21.200]   it's a really different situation from you and me, who no matter how many times you go to the gym,
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:28.000]   that's not the same as working for 10 hours in the fields. And also, the epidemiological
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.640]   environment is so crazy different. And all those people in Ireland only live to the age of 40
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:40.480]   anyway. So there's a whole host of studies that show that people who take extreme diets,
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:46.560]   almost always they work. Nothing but beans, nothing but this, and people lose a lot of
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:52.160]   weight in the short term. It's really difficult to show that it's possible to keep it off,
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:56.080]   and it's possible for people to maintain these kinds of diets for long periods of time.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:02.880]   Right, right. I remember that part of the book where you have that passage from Adam Smith,
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:07.520]   where he's commenting on how all these Irish people, they only eat potatoes, but all of them
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.160]   seem so healthy and beautiful. Yeah. Right. Well, they're also out in the
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:14.080]   fields and not in London, right? Adam Smith's looking at Edinburgh and places like that,
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:19.280]   which are the most unhealthy places on the planet. Say you have no discount rate. So you think future
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.840]   people matter exactly as much as current people. Yeah.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.600]   Does that shift you more towards the profit side or the wizard side? Not in absolute terms,
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.000]   but from where you're starting out? I have to say, I'm uncomfortable with that
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.760]   entire time reason. This is something that William MacAskill talks about. And I don't think,
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:40.320]   from what I've read of his, he takes seriously enough the question that we don't know what those
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:47.280]   future people will want. There's no question that what we want today would have seemed abhorrent to
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:56.400]   people, most people in 1800. So the idea that we can have any other idea other than they probably
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:06.880]   want to be alive, it seems much more questionable than I think it does. And so there's two ways to
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:13.200]   look at it. One is the wizards say, we have an idea they're going to want to live in this certain
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:20.240]   kind of utopia and live their longest lives and have the maximum possible physical comfort,
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:27.200]   which is generally what the wizards say. The prophets might say, and that seems perfectly
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:32.720]   reasonable to me, but the prophets might say, well, we should be more epistemologically humble,
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.840]   say we don't know what they want to, let's preserve as many options as possible for them.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:41.440]   That doesn't seem crazy. I personally probably leaned more to the wizards on this, but if a
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.000]   prophet said that to me, I wouldn't say, oh, you're wrong. Because that's the same argument
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.440]   about burying nuclear waste, which I also think is very powerful, that we should probably not
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:55.040]   bury it in some system where it can't be gotten rid of for 10,000 years. We should just make sure
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:01.120]   that we can track it for a couple hundred years and there'll be more options for people 200 years
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:07.840]   from now than there are today. Okay, so what is wrong with the basic free market objection to the
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:14.800]   curing capacity arguments, which goes like, okay, let's say we do reach the ends of some resource,
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:20.480]   then its price will just increase until you reach some sort of sustainable equilibrium and people
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:25.760]   will just decrease their consumption or keep it constant or something. So let's say with meat,
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.160]   people are concerned that the developing world, as it gets richer, people are going to eat more meat.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:34.640]   But if it's true that it consumes 10 times the energy and the grain as just like feeding them
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:41.600]   directly, then that'll be represented in the price. And then so the trend lines might be
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:46.000]   mistaken because the price of meat will increase or something. Yeah, no, I think that's a very
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.360]   powerful argument. But the problem with it, to my mind, is that the kinds of things that we're
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:29:00.160]   talking about, we care about for curing capacity, aren't things like bubble gum, or things like
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:07.200]   food, water, energy. And those have never, as far as I know, been governed by anything remotely
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:14.320]   resembling the free market. They aren't today, they never have been in the past. So it seems to
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.680]   me an interesting thought experiment to imagine what would happen if you truly had a free market
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:27.680]   for those things. But it also seems pointless because if I had to bet, I'd bet that it would
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:31.040]   be the same way it's been for the last couple thousand years, and we don't have a free market.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:35.840]   And we already have all kinds of weird distortions because of that, from your point of view,
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:40.640]   the tremendous amount of food that's wasted, the crazy arrangements we have for water,
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:47.680]   and the similarity of these ludicrous things. I have this idea, you're in Texas, right? You
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:53.120]   have this thing where Texas has its own independent grid, so it can't trade energy with other states
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:30:00.880]   that are nearby. What the heck is that? That's really crazy. I don't want me to pick on Texas,
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:04.640]   but it's just something I was thinking. There's equally crazy things all over the place. The
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:10.800]   impossibility of building long distance, high tension lines, because various states have just
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.840]   arbitrarily imposed rules that make it impossible. There's all kinds of crazy things going on.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:23.200]   So I guess I think what you're saying is very likely to be true in a system that will never exist.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:28.080]   Unfortunately, because that's kind of a nice idea.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:38.080]   Right. That seems an excellent note to close on. I learned so much from the books and I learned so
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:44.480]   much from talking to you, so I really enjoy this. The books, again, that we talked about were 1491,
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:51.920]   1493, The Wizard and the Prophet for anybody interested. Is there any other place that you
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:58.560]   would like to direct viewers who might want to check out your work? I guess stay tuned for my
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:03.520]   book about the West, which should be coming out next year if I'm at all lucky. Okay. I'd love to
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:07.440]   have you back on again when it comes out. Oh, sure. We can talk about that. Texas has got an
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:11.760]   amazing history. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. One of the things I learned about was the Comanche,
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:19.360]   Ross Custer's, and their role in Texas history is just totally eye-poppingly amazing. So that's
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:24.240]   actually a very fun part too. So we can talk about your Texas roots. We definitely will.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.720]   Thanks so much for coming on, Charles. Sure. Pleasure. Nice to meet you.
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:37.680]   Hey, thanks for listening. If you enjoyed that episode, I would really, really, really appreciate
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:44.320]   it if you could share it. This is still a pretty small podcast. So it is a huge help when any one
