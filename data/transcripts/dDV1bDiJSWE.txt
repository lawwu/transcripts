[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   So it's the new year, which means today I want to talk about one of the most critical
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.120]   skills for improving your life in 2024.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.800]   And that is learning hard things.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.620]   So in work, this could be mastering that difficult, but valuable new system or methodology that's
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.760]   going to help you really gain control and write your own ticket in your personal life.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.960]   It might be developing some sort of connoisseurship that gives you a, a lasting, deeper satisfaction
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.480]   that you're getting right now, just being distracted by the screens in your life.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.760]   I want to teach you how to do this.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.720]   I want to talk about how do you master not easy things, but really complicated things.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.520]   And the way I'm going to do this is I'm going to start with what we get wrong.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.360]   I think we have a commonly held, but mistaken mental model for how people learn complex
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.360]   things.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.940]   So we're going to start by deconstructing that mental model, and then I'm going to replace
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.640]   it with one that works.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.600]   And from here, we're going to get some concrete advice about how you actually become better
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.200]   at hard things.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.000]   So we'll get into all of this.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.620]   So let's start with what we get wrong.
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.540]   I'm going to load up a picture here.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.640]   So for those who are watching, instead of just listening, you'll see on the screen,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.920]   I'm going to draw the mental model that most people have.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.120]   You'll see on the screen here that I've have a sort of hierarchy of things you might learn
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.600]   over on the right side.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.280]   I kind of just threw this together, but from something that's perceived to be more complex
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.640]   towards things to be conceived to be less complex.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.760]   So I put at the very top of this hierarchy, we have what is math, you know, math symbols
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.640]   like, okay, so learning complicated math equations, and then I have below it a Proust book.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.840]   So I don't know, like mastering literature, some sort of complex literature right in the
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.840]   middle.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.660]   Maybe we have like a deep appreciation for a particular type of music.
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.760]   You know, I'm a, whatever, a big Tom Waits fan.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760]   I can really get into that.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.440]   I don't know, below that, maybe like I following a sport like baseball, like you have a pretty
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.040]   good understanding of what's happening with different teams.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.240]   I put, you know, not to be self incriminating here, Jesse, but I put at the bottom like
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   YouTube.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.640]   Like, yeah, there's like, I'm really know a lot about YouTube and what's going on on
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640]   YouTube.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.280]   And so we have a hierarchy of complexity here.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.800]   Now the way most people think about learning these type of master, getting mastered these
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.860]   type of different topics is that everyone has a fundamental limit determined by their
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.860]   brain.
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.820]   So the common mental model says for this one individual here, maybe when they are thinking
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.340]   about, you know, hey, I want to really master some element of music.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.000]   They can do that, put some earphones on them in my picture here, like, this is great.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.140]   I'm capable of doing it.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.820]   But maybe this same person, when they say, okay, what I really want to master is mathematics.
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.320]   So I can do like mathematics proofs and our common mental model, we might say, oh, that's
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.840]   just beyond this person's brain.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.840]   So they can't do that.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   Right.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.800]   So we have this notion of the complexity of what you have mastered is just a direct reflection
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.360]   of how smart you are.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.200]   Oh, this academic has a really, a PhD in literature has a really subtle understanding of these
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.700]   books that I don't even know how to approach.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.400]   They're smarter than me.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.920]   I understand music that makes me smarter than this 22 year old who's like main interest
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   is YouTubers.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.920]   Right.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.640]   That's the way we think about it.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.900]   This model is wrong.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.160]   So this idea that your brain is determining the level of complexity of stuff that you're
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.860]   able to comfortably master completely misunderstands how learning happens.
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.860]   So what I want to do here is present to you the reality, and I'm going to present to you
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.780]   the reality here in two parts that we can think of as the good news and the bad news.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.500]   The good news and the bad news about how people actually learn complicated things.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   Now, the good news is most people are cognitively capable of learning things that are pretty
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:14.140]   high up on that imagined hierarchy of complexity that you can learn complicated literature.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.940]   You can learn mathematical things.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.780]   You can learn an appreciation of a complicated sport or music.
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.500]   Most people can learn most things.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.740]   Now, is there a brain power difference that comes into play here?
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.380]   There's stuff that shows up.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.980]   I think certainly by adulthood, you get a sense people have different RPMs going on
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.580]   with their brains.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.380]   I tend to believe that a lot of this is less genetic than it is just what you did as a
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.380]   child.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.940]   If you're a heavy reader as a child, for example, your brain has just been trained to be stronger
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.940]   much in the same way.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.260]   If you're Arnold Schwarzenegger and your dad made you do pushups and squats before you
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.260]   would be given a meal, you're going to be stronger by the age of 19 than someone else.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.580]   So I tend to think the RPMs you have going is as much nurture as it is nature, but yeah,
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.580]   there are some differences.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.980]   But that difference is where is this going to affect learning complicated things?
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.980]   The upper end, which is not going to be relevant to most people, it's like almost anyone can
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.300]   learn calculus.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.740]   Yeah, maybe not everyone, however, is going to be a Fields Award winner, but most people
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.740]   don't care.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.740]   They're not trying to become Fields Award winners.
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.900]   You might also see it in some speed differences and how fast you make progress towards learning
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.900]   things.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.780]   So there are some epsilons there depending on how used to that your brain is.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.980]   But again, for most people, no one knows exactly at what rate you mastered something, so it
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.980]   doesn't really matter.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.700]   So I think for the most part, I'm going to argue most people can learn most things.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.900]   So you can learn almost anything.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.380]   Part two of the reality, and this is the bad news, you can learn almost anything, but you
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.420]   can't learn everything.
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.060]   So I think what is obscured when you encounter people who have a mastery of something really
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.220]   complicated, what is obscured is that it took them a really long time to get to that place.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.820]   We jump ahead and just imagine them a month ago, just picked up the math textbook and
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.300]   was like, "Ooh, this just makes sense to me."
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.620]   And then everyone kind of applauds and they're really good at math and they're obviously
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.620]   smarter than you.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.980]   Now, there's a long process that we're going to unfold here in a second of how they build
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.740]   up to that expert knowledge.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.020]   The reason why this means you can't learn everything is that it takes time.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.020]   Time is finite.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.900]   So there's only going to be so many complicated things you can learn because you only have
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.860]   so much time to put into it and it takes a lot of time to actually get there.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.240]   So this is the big mental model shift I want to start us making right now, is thinking
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:52.500]   about learning the complexity of what you learned, shifting this away from brain power
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.020]   and towards time investment.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.460]   More time means more complexity can be learned.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.180]   Less time means less complexity can be learned.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.200]   Brain power is sort of orthogonal to all of this.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.060]   So let's fill in this mental model.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.380]   I'm going to draw another picture here that I think captures well what the process really
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.500]   looks like when you're trying to learn something hard.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.660]   So for those who are listening instead of watching, what you'll see I'm drawing here
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.740]   is a bunch of stair steps and we can put some goal at the top.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.620]   So I'll put a music note at the top.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.320]   You're trying to master, have a good understanding of jazz music or something like this.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:39.000]   The way you actually progress towards hard understanding is up stairs, level by level.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.280]   Now here's what's important.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.700]   When you're at a given level of understanding, so let's say you're right here, your brain
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.560]   is only capable when you're moving up your level understanding of making a relatively
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.220]   small step at a time.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.100]   That's why these steps are small.
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.240]   There are multiple steps to get from down here where you know in this example nothing
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.720]   about jazz music, many steps until you get up here to being able to talk really intelligently
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.020]   about it.
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.300]   So it's from your current level, you move up to the next level.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.060]   Now how these steps are actually made.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.100]   So how does this actually happen here and here and here?
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.760]   Deliberate practice.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:27.620]   Carefully designed exercises that push your understanding to the next level in a way that
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.980]   takes you out of what you're already comfortable with.
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.600]   There has to be some strain into that.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.740]   So in order for this step to be successfully had at each of these levels, you have to stretch
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.740]   past where you're comfortable.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.740]   Right?
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.820]   It's kind of the practice aspect of deliberate practice.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.940]   It's not fun.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.460]   I'm not comfortable, I don't really understand this thing, and I'm stretching myself to try
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.000]   to understand it.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.220]   And the activity you're doing is carefully designed.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.180]   This is the right next level to actually move up to.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:05.900]   That's the deliberate piece of deliberate practice.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.860]   So when you see someone like, wow, this person has a lot of expert knowledge of complicated
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.860]   things.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.540]   In their past, they have done these stair steps.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.340]   Now there's various cultural professional structures that help drive you through these
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.340]   stair steps.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.340]   Right?
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.820]   So if you're an academic, I mean, I'm an academic.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.820]   One of the things I do is theoretical computer science.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:31.900]   I write mathematical proofs related to algorithms and computability and complexity.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.540]   If you encounter a paper I wrote, you might say, I don't understand any of this.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.140]   I can't imagine just like sitting down and learning all of this.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.740]   But what you have to realize for me is that that process started when I was about 16 years
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.740]   old.
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.500]   And the education process as you move up the ranks, high school to advanced high school,
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:55.900]   to undergrad, to grad school, into young professoredom, is it's designed to push you step by step
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.300]   by step with literal tests.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   You know?
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.300]   Okay.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.300]   You're now taking AP Computer Science.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.300]   Right?
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.300]   I took that when I was young.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.820]   And I realized that you're taking literal tests.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.700]   In order to master that test, you had to gain new knowledge.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.900]   It pushes you to the next level.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.620]   And then after AP Computer Science, because I was good at this stuff, I started taking
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.940]   some college courses in computer science.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.980]   That had, okay, that's pushing me a little bit farther.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.300]   Now I go to college and I can take the more advanced courses.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.300]   It's pushing you farther.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.660]   I get to MIT and now these courses are much harder.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.080]   But I've gone up 17 steps before I got to taking, you know, theory of computation with
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.220]   Mike Sipser, step by step by step.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.060]   Hey, quick interruption.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:42.240]   If you want my free guide with my seven best ideas on how to cultivate the deep life, go
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:48.420]   to calnewport.com/ideas or click the link right below in the description.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.140]   This is a great way to take action on the type of things we talk about here on this
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.140]   show.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.140]   All right, let's get back to it.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.840]   And by the time you encounter me at the age of like 35, like, Oh, you know, all this stuff,
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.200]   like, yeah, it was a really long climb up the steps, really long climb up the staircase.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.440]   Same thing when someone has this, how does this guy know so much about music?
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.400]   Well, probably he was exposed to it early on and his dad or mom really got him into
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   it.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   And step by step they got knowledge.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.440]   So if you want to cultivate expert knowledge now in your life, you have to replicate all
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.720]   of these steps.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:27.840]   Your goal is on what is the next step of understanding I can take, not how far am I from the top,
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.360]   the consistent stair step upwards.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:39.180]   This requires patience because the ladder up is long and it requires expert help because
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:46.400]   choosing the right activities that move you to a new level and are tractable but not trivial.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.300]   This is the key dichotomy for deliberate practice to be effective, tractable, but not trivial.
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.720]   You can accomplish this next step, but it can't be super easy because you're not actually
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   stretching.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.440]   That could require expert help and that can be found by actually working with real experts
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.560]   that can be found in courses that can be learned, found in books.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.640]   It can be found in choosing careful goals for what you want to do next and then seeking
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.700]   out help anywhere you can online in person courses to get to that next step and accomplish
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.700]   that goal.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:22.120]   Just the careful choices of goals can get you there, but it's patience and this careful
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.200]   expert guided design of how you move.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.160]   That's how people get smarter and smarter or seemingly smarter and smarter.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.120]   It just takes time and it takes care.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.440]   So is this worth it?
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.000]   Well, I think the answer is yes.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.120]   The brain is what distinguishes humans.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.560]   Our brains distinguish us from other animals.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.920]   We have this ability that Aristotle talks about in the Nicomachean Ethics.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.360]   We have this ability that no one else has to contemplate deeply, to aim our brain at
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.440]   abstract ends.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.440]   Dogs don't do this.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.440]   Cats don't do this.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   Parakeets don't do this.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.440]   Humans can't.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:07.700]   So Aristotle would say this is perhaps the ultimate teleology of the human experience.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:13.920]   The thing that we are wired to do ultimately is to use our brain in these exalted ways
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.120]   because that's what defines us as human.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.240]   So we want to push our humanness.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.440]   It is a key element of life you're missing if there are not things in your life that
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.960]   you know that are hard, that are complicated, and you can do very well.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.620]   To have that in your life in some sense, in the Aristotelian sense, is to be more human.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.400]   So what I recommend, especially for younger people, is here's what you want almost to
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.880]   be aiming towards right away.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.680]   Something in your professional life that's complicated that you do well, better than
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.920]   anyone else you know at your company or organization.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.640]   Right out the bat, what is a complicated skill?
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.080]   Really good at programming these type of data systems.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:57.200]   We're an SAP company, like being able to build advanced models using statistical analysis,
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.160]   a type of art, you know, you're a graphic designer for a video game company and pushing
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.620]   whatever the latest is and doing some sort of 3D modeling.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.920]   Something that is really complicated and valuable that you know well.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.240]   Just set that standard right away.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.080]   In your personal life, you should have the same.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.960]   Everyone should have one thing that they're working towards just being really good with.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.440]   I really understand movies.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.280]   I really understand wine.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.480]   Not like a casual, I kind of read about this, but I got a sommelier certificate.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.000]   Not just like I go to the theaters, but you know, I could write and I do sometimes contribute
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.800]   reviews to online publications about movies.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:43.760]   There is something deeply satisfying in feeling the mastery of complicated things.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.760]   It's uniquely human.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.800]   I think a lot of people avoid it.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.600]   A lot of people do not have this in their life, and it leads to this distinction as
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.560]   people who do that stuff, and I don't know how to do that stuff.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.760]   And either that leads you to feel down on yourself unjustifiably, or it makes you real
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.480]   reactionary and angry as elites think they're so smart.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.480]   Neither is great.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.200]   It's not as healthy from a mental health perspective.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.960]   We all should be trying to master at least some complicated things.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.080]   Now this could take years.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.480]   You're going to see progress along the way, but you want to get really good at something
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   hard.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.480]   It could take years.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.760]   Start right now.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.240]   You will get benefits along the way.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.400]   You'll get better and better, but don't pull yourself up short.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.680]   I know a little bit more about this than just the average person.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   That's great.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680]   Keep pushing.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.880]   You want to push some knowledges to this connoisseur level.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.040]   It really is, I think, a key part of the deep life because it unlocks in you an understanding
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.520]   of what your brain is capable of.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.760]   The final question is where are you going to get the time?
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.320]   Where are you going to find the time to have one or two of these projects you're working
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.320]   on?
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.940]   And honestly, and look, this is a show about technology and how it impacts our lives.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.840]   This might be non-surprising, but this is where you're going to find the time.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.200]   Stop spending time on the phone.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.900]   If you have nothing in your life that you feel like you're a real expert on, I'm going
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:10.200]   to guess without knowing for sure that your screen time statistics aren't great, that
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:15.240]   you're getting that dopamine push towards the screen where there's going to be something
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:21.080]   funny or outrageous or distracting or whatever on there, and this is eating up time after
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.440]   time after time.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.400]   Put that phone into the foyer, phone foyer method.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.840]   New Year is a great time to do this.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.240]   The phone is plugged in in my kitchen or the foyer if I need it.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.160]   I can go there to look something up, but it's not with me as a default.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.420]   It's not with me at the couch.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.480]   It's not with me at the dinner table.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.680]   It's not with me, God forbid, in the bathroom.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.920]   Now your brain gets some freedom.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.200]   It wants something to do.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.000]   Let's give it something to do.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.440]   We're moving up the next stair level on this work skill.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.520]   We're moving up the next stair level on this personal life skill.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.840]   This really will, it's why I wish it for everyone in the New Year, is really going to change
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.860]   the way you feel about yourself, your efficacy, your ability to actually do important, useful
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.960]   things with your brain.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.160]   So you can't, you can learn anything, you just can't learn everything.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.680]   So choose a few things that are worth learning and trick a lot of people into thinking that
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.920]   you're smarter than you actually are, because the more complicated the stuff goes, the more
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.000]   they're going to just think that you're a big brain.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And I think it's worth it.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   So there you go, Jesse.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.320]   I think too many people think they're stupider than they are because of this image of, you
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.720]   know, for some people, this quote unquote comes easy.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.720]   There is no coming easy.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.560]   It's the exact same as muscles.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.600]   Some people grow faster than others, but it takes a really long time.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.120]   A lot of cycles of cutting and building, they look like a superhero.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   Just takes time.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.000]   What's something you work on in your personal life?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Movies.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.920]   I've been, I'm working on movie knowledge.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:53.000]   I want to get to, and I'm working on this systematically, I want to get to a level where
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   I can contribute reviews.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.920]   Oh, I feel like you'll be able to do that, don't you think?
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.920]   Like good reviews.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:05.080]   You know, like really understand, really understand the art and form of cinema, like what's going
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.080]   on.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.600]   I also, another way of looking at it is I don't want to be surprised by the good reviews.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.960]   Like in other words, I want to be able to predict, oh, I know kind of what Anthony Lane's
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.320]   probably going to say about this movie and not have to, and I'm getting closer at that.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.600]   I know David Dimby, I know what David Dimby is going to write about this, like getting
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.760]   closer to that.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.520]   As opposed to like, I don't know, is this a good movie?
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.520]   Let's read the reviews.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.200]   Oh, I really love this movie.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   You know?
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.920]   So it's like, I want to be able to be non-surprised by the really good reviews.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.640]   And I want to be capable of, hey, I could provide a review for, you know, an online
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.640]   site.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.320]   And this is an insightful review.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.440]   We should probably put a movie and show site on the deeplife.com.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440]   I think we should.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.560]   Because there's a lot of times I'm, I have like my own list, but.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.880]   Well, we should keep track of all the books and we should keep track of like movie recommendations.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.000]   Cause it'd be a good place for people to go if they wanted something good to watch because
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   oftentimes I'm.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.680]   Two movies I just watched was, I had never remembered seeing Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.640]   Also just watched Jeff, Tim Gunn, not Tim Gunn.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:21.000]   What's the, not the guy from the movie maker Gunn, but I just forgot if it's James Gunn.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.960]   I think it's James Gunn, the director who did guardians of the galaxy was temporarily
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:33.560]   canceled and now DC has brought him back to play the Kevin Feige role for the DC extended
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.560]   cinematic universe.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.480]   I believe his name is James Gunn, whereas Tim Gunn was the fashion designer from project
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.480]   runway.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.000]   I often mix up those two names.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.800]   I think it's James Gunn.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.120]   The suicide squad 2021 fantastic.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.120]   Like Tarantino.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.160]   He's the CEO of DC studios.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:58.240]   Watch the suicide squad 2021 Tarantino ask comic book movie completely playing with the
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:05.240]   B movie format over the top violence, but also, um, visually completely novel, hyperactive
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.720]   camera throwing in actual deep themes and interesting characterization against this
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.180]   backdrop of craziness.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:16.480]   It is, if as you had said, the Tarantino make a comic book movie completely off the wall.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.480]   Fantastic movie.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.480]   I really like that.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.480]   Do you watch a lot of movies in the same like TV, et cetera, with like surround sound or
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.480]   yeah.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.480]   I have a good TV.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.480]   Surround sound.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.480]   We, we set that up during the, the subwoofers and everything too.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   We set that up during the pandemic.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.480]   Um, and I see a lot of movies.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.720]   I mean, we're recording, not the, not the pull back the curtain, but we're recording
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.760]   this before Christmas, uh, this week I'm seeing tonight I'm going to see maestro with a friend
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.840]   of mine.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.480]   And then later in the week, another friend of mine, we're going to go see big screen
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.120]   diehard in honor of Christmas.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.120]   And how many movies do you watch a week?
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.060]   That just depends too.
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.160]   It depends on what's going on with like the evenings and childcare and stuff like that.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.160]   And my schedule.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.540]   I like, if I have a light schedule, I like to take a day and do a lunchtime movie watching
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.720]   at home.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.020]   But so if I have freedom in my schedule, I'll take a day and watch a movie over lunch.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.020]   That helps.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.020]   All right.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.020]   Anyways.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.760]   Um, I talk about this by the way, in the new book, slow productivity coming out in March,
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.600]   I talk about my growing interest in movies and how, uh, for anyone who does creative
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:25.600]   work, studying and building up a good appreciation for an unrelated creative field actually can
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.800]   really help what you're doing.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.880]   And I write about a slow productivity about studying films as helping my writing.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:36.000]   If you study, if I study good writers, it's too close to home and it's kind of a, more
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.840]   of a stressful work in like, it's not inspiring.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.720]   It's more, uh, I should do more of that or it's more anxiety producing.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.320]   So you study art in another format.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   You can come at that.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.320]   It's like, I don't do that art.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.380]   So you can just appreciate it with open eyes and it gives you an injection of creative
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.600]   energy for what you're doing.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.560]   So I'm a big, I talk about this a lot.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.240]   It's not a lot, but I do talk about it in slow productivity, studying an art.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.400]   That's not what you do will make you more inspired for what you do actually do.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.040]   All right.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:11.640]   Speaking of which we got, uh, questions from you, the listeners on this topic before we
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.680]   get there, um, I want to mention one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.960]   Oh, there we go.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   Add sound effect.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   I forgot, Jesse.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.960]   Let's do that again.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   Let's do it.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.960]   Clean.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.960]   Now we can talk sponsors.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.960]   All right.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.440]   I want to talk about Zock Doc.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.320]   Little known story about Zock Doc, Jesse, the company was actually started first with
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.160]   just the name.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.480]   People just like saying zockdoc.com and then they had to say, what's a really useful business
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.640]   we could do now that we have this awesome, easy to pronounce name zockdoc.com.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.640]   And that's what they figured out.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640]   Wait a second.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:54.240]   It is a huge pain to find schedule appointments with good doctors or other types of medical
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.320]   care providers.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:02.140]   Why don't we use our awesome name zockdoc.com to help with that problem.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.440]   And this is exactly what they did.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.680]   So now if you're trying to find whatever type of medical care you need, you can go onto
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:16.640]   the Zock Doc app, find providers near you, find providers that take your insurance, find
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.280]   providers that are taking new clients, find providers that have good reviews from actual
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   patients.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:29.080]   You can hone in on exactly the right provider to work with and sign up right there.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.800]   Once you're actually seeing a doctor you found through Zock Doc, a lot of these medical providers
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:40.320]   and doctors will use the Zock Doc package to handle things like paperwork ahead of time,
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.440]   appointment reminders.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:47.400]   I have two different doctors in my life that use the Zock Doc systems and it just is much
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   easier.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.680]   A lot of stuff just happens through text messages.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.560]   So it really is just one of these ideas that makes sense.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.560]   How do I find a doctor that checks all the boxes I need?
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.120]   Why can't my phone help me with this?
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:06.720]   It can, ZockDoc.com is the app that is going to do this for you.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.320]   It is a free app and website, let's emphasize that, a free app and website that allows you
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.820]   to search and compare highly rated in-network doctors near you and instantly book those
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.280]   appointments with them online.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.240]   As mentioned, you can book them immediately.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.840]   No wait and hold with a receptionist.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:28.800]   We have doctors with reviews from actual verified patients, thousands of top-rated patient-reviewed
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   doctors are in the system.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.280]   It's just the right way to find a medical provider.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.120]   So if you've been putting off something, you have that weird growth on your foot that you've
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.520]   been putting off taking care of, now it's the new year, it's the time to do it, ZockDoc
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.040]   is how you're going to get started.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:50.720]   So go to ZockDoc.com/deep and download the ZockDoc app for free.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.880]   You can use it to find and book top-rated doctors today.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:59.640]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, ZockDoc.com/deep.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:05.280]   Just before we start recording, Jesse, I got a text from my dentist who uses ZockDoc, a
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:11.200]   reminder about something so it works, makes my life easier right away.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.840]   This show is also sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.320]   For some people, the holiday season that just passed was a time of joy and togetherness,
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.440]   but most of those people exist only in the world of hallmark movies.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.400]   For a lot of people, it's stressful.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:35.440]   And for those who are struggling some with their own minds, ruminations, negative thinking,
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.120]   the holidays can make things a lot worse.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:44.400]   Well, that means right now in the new year is the time to actually take care of yourself,
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.900]   to take care of your relationship with the most important part of you, which is your
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.320]   mind.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.160]   Therapy is what's going to help you do this.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:59.480]   We hear from dozens of listeners who talk about going through therapy as a way to repair
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.400]   their relationship with their brain and how this then unlocked all these other things
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.880]   they wanted to do, these aspirations to cultivate a deeper life.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.000]   They had to get past these obstacles in their own brain first, and therapy made that all
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   possible.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.720]   Now, the issue with therapy is, again, logistically, it is difficult to find a practitioner.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.880]   Is there someone who happens to be nearby?
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.400]   Are they taking new patients?
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.440]   What if I don't like them?
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.440]   This is awkward.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.880]   They're the only therapist in my town.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.760]   I have to somehow stop working with them and I'm going to see them all the time.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:37.440]   This is where something like BetterHelp enters the scene and makes all of this much easier.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.800]   It's entirely online.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.120]   It's designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.700]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:52.200]   You can switch your therapist anytime for no additional charge, so by leveraging the
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.780]   distance obliterating capabilities of the internet, BetterHelp makes it easy for you
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:02.200]   right away to get connected and starting therapy.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.920]   So celebrate the progress you've already made and visit betterhelp.com/deepquestions today
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.900]   to get 10% off your first month.

[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.340]   All right, speaking of questions, Jesse, let's do our questions.
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.820]   All right, first question's from Mark.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.340]   What is note-taking for?
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.860]   I found note-taking most useful in the short term, grounding me in my current task or noting
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.500]   a few to-dos throughout the day.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.620]   Almost all of them are immediately disposable.
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:40.180]   It seems like note-taking can become fairly navel-gazing and doing it excessively takes
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.180]   away from execution.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:47.140]   It's a good question because we see this a lot in our discussions of organization.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:52.040]   Notes and note-taking is an excessively broad term.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:57.360]   It covers lots of different things, and for a lot of people, like Mark, these things get
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.060]   all mixed up, and they're thinking, "Well, I don't know.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.780]   I'm sitting here journaling all day.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.780]   Is this note-taking?
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.780]   What should I be doing?
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.780]   What should I not be doing?"
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:10.780]   So, what I want to do here is step back, and let's give a general definition for note-taking,
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:15.820]   and then I want to highlight what I think the three critical types of note-taking systems
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:21.380]   you need in your life if you work any sort of knowledge job, and then we can, from there,
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.380]   move on to talk about more advanced options.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:30.560]   So, let's define note-taking more generally to mean recording information on a durable
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.300]   written medium.
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:37.380]   So, anywhere you're collecting information in a written medium that's durable, you have
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.740]   it outside of your head, so you can reference it later.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.380]   Here are the three types of this note-taking that I think are critical, especially for
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.700]   most knowledge workers.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:51.300]   One, some sort of working memory extender.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:56.820]   This is where I use my text file on my desktop of my computer's workingmemory.txt.
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:02.200]   This is for strictly expanding the amount of information you can temporarily hold on
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:07.060]   to as you engage with the inflow of information throughout your workday.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:11.380]   So, as things come in, you're in a meeting and people are suggesting next steps, you
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:17.940]   can just write this information down in whatever medium you use for your working memory extender,
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.100]   because it's probably more information you can keep in your head.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.100]   So, there it is.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.100]   I write it down right there.
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:27.060]   Or, I'm going through my email inbox and I need to remember different notes I need to
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.980]   act on, schedule this, get back to them.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.200]   I can write it into my workingmemory.extender.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.500]   These are notes that exist outside of your own brain, allows you to hold on and organize
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.940]   more information than you could do just strictly within the confines of your own neurons.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.620]   Now, this is something that resets all the time.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.300]   It's a durable form, but you reset it all the time.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.180]   So, as I'm going through a meeting, I'm taking quick notes on here's the five things I need
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.560]   to do.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:57.700]   After that meeting, those notes will then get processed out of my working memory file
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.340]   into calendar reminders, into my obligation system.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:06.780]   So, it's a temporary storage, but it allows me in the moment to keep track of more things
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.220]   that my brain can do on its own.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.540]   That's note taking, but of a very temporary type.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.840]   Next comes what I just cited, which is your obligation tracker.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.420]   Some system to maintain all of the relevant information for every obligation on your plate.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.460]   This is also note taking, written durable information that you don't have to keep track
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.780]   of in your head.
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:30.040]   So somewhere, here are all the things I have to do, probably categorized.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:36.260]   Here is all of the information related to each of these things all in this one place.
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:41.980]   You want that information accessible and captured somewhere, that's note taking.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.020]   Then finally, we get to what most people think of when they think about note taking, and
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.740]   this is more where you're capturing key ideas about your work and your life.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:56.880]   It could be interesting ideas, interesting articles, brainstorms, concerns that you have.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.380]   This is the broad category that captures what people normally think about in note taking.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.260]   I might be journaling my thoughts about things.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.100]   I might be writing down my plans for how I want to improve my life.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:11.220]   I might be capturing articles that are relevant to the newsletter that I run and things I
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.740]   want to remember.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.060]   And this is where you're going to use whatever type of system you like to capture things
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.060]   in.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.500]   You have a lot of different choices here.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.220]   All three of these things are note taking.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.980]   You need some sort of system for each.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:31.520]   So in my own life, I use a plain text file for working memory.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:37.900]   I use Trello for obligation tracking notes, one board per role, one column per type of
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:44.800]   obligation, one card per obligation, all of the relevant information for that obligation
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.620]   on the card.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.940]   And I use my Remarkable 2 digital notebook for everything else.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.580]   Inside my Remarkable 2, I have dozens of different individual virtual notebooks for keeping track
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.780]   of ideas, reflections, concerns, etc.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.320]   So those are the three categories, Mark.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:06.420]   Do those three categories, different tools for each, different rates of refresh and reset
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.040]   for each working memory, you're resetting this every 10 minutes or so.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.660]   Your obligation list you're working with every day.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:17.500]   Your bigger idea capture is something you maybe go over in detail much less often.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.420]   Hey, I'm going to have a summit now to rethink this part of my business.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.700]   Let me go back and look through my notes.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.500]   Maybe that's just once every few months or so.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.040]   So that's really it.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.980]   There are more complicated systems and methodologies.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.100]   You know, we have a lot of fans here of Zettelkasten type systems.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:41.500]   We also have a lot of fans here of interesting note-taking software that really gets into
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:47.100]   the details of how you store notes, how you connect notes, the format in which the notes
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.860]   are stored.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.300]   That is optional.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.760]   It's more about your interest.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:58.500]   If you like information management as a hobby, you can build more complicated systems around
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.380]   it, but you don't need complicated systems to successfully take notes.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.060]   Those are the three areas you have to take notes.
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:09.060]   Just make sure those are all three covered with some sort of reasonable techno system,
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.060]   and then you're doing a fine job.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.900]   I think that separation is key.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.480]   Don't mix all this stuff together.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:20.460]   Don't have a moleskin somewhere in which you're trying to keep your tasks next to your vision
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:25.460]   for living on a cabin in 20 years next to a grocery list you want to remember when you
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.460]   go to the store.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:30.660]   We need some separation for note-taking to keep up with the complexity of modern life.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.660]   All right.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.780]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.980]   Next question is from Reshab.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:42.140]   As a 26-year-old software developer who has recently landed a well-paying job, I'm looking
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:47.100]   to pursue my interest in learning to play the guitar, drawing, and some days gardening.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.580]   However, I'm concerned about whether it's feasible to schedule all these activities
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:55.300]   into a single week while maintaining a focus on deep life core fundamentals.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.780]   In your expert opinion, would it be possible to balance all these pursuits effectively
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.700]   within a given week without compromising on essential life habits?
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:09.340]   Well, I think this is a objective question for which you can get an objective answer
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.020]   by becoming quantitative.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.140]   So let's just work with your calendar.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.780]   I'm assuming you're professionally speaking, you're organized, you time block your days,
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:20.780]   you have a clear shutdown.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.340]   So there's some clarity about your time outside of work.
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.700]   Play with that time.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:31.740]   So start autopilot scheduling some of these hobbies.
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:34.180]   Maybe you garden on weekday mornings.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:40.140]   Maybe you alternate a guitar practice session and what was the other thing, drawing practice
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.480]   session on different days.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.780]   You do it an hour before dinner.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.940]   Autopilot this out.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.940]   See if it fits.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:53.420]   And if the stuff does fit, execute this autopilot schedule for a while and say, "Does this feel
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:58.020]   sustainable or do I feel like I'm constantly running from one thing to another or it's
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.820]   overfilling my time?"
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:05.300]   I used to run this exercise with undergraduates who are trying to figure out their academic
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.220]   programs and their extracurricular programs.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:11.420]   And I would say, "We got to sit down and just build a plan for your proposal here.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.060]   You want to do these five extracurriculars in double major?
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.060]   Show me the time."
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.820]   Then they would go through and block off the time for studying and how long is this going
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.060]   to take and put on their meetings and the time to work on their activities.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.900]   And it either fit or it didn't.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.100]   And sometimes if it just barely fit, they would come back a week later and say, "This
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.100]   is crazy.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.420]   Every minute of my life is scheduled."
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.820]   So if it doesn't fit or it fits and your life feels too crowded, then you just pull back.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.700]   You're getting an objective feedback here.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.700]   You pull back.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.300]   And it doesn't matter if you're pulling back.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.700]   These are hobbies.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.660]   The thing is you want to be spending quality time outside of work on things that matter.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.100]   The quantity isn't important.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:54.260]   So if it doesn't fit or it barely fits, maybe you do seasonal pursuits.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:58.380]   In the spring, I'm working a lot on my garden and in the winter, I'm spending a lot more
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.640]   time on guitar because that's sort of inside.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.100]   And I do drawing in the fall.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.260]   You could have seasonal pursuits.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.420]   You could stack these one over another.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:12.760]   Or maybe what you need to do is just slow down your ambition for these pursuits.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.900]   And instead of saying, "Look, I'm going to do four hours of guitar a day and I want to
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.540]   be shredding in like six months," you say, "I'm going to spend less time."
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.380]   Good hard practice, like we talked about at the deep dive, trying to move up the stair
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.300]   steps towards expert knowledge, but I'm just willing for this to take longer.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.020]   A few years from now, I'll be a pretty good guitar player, but I'm playing just an hour
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.020]   every other day.
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.260]   That doesn't take up as much time.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.260]   I have a drawing class I take once a week.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.480]   And on Fridays, I get out of work early and go to a park to work on the drawing.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.300]   This is maybe I'm going to learn these skills slower, but that makes their footprint on
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:48.900]   my schedule smaller and I have more give and more flexibility and don't feel like I'm overscheduled.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.580]   So treat this like a quantitative question.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.180]   Get clear feedback.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.420]   If it's too much, reduce or slow down.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.980]   It doesn't really matter for your goal here, which is just to make sure that you're engaged
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.900]   in deeper pursuits.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:07.220]   That's what matters, not the speed at which you're getting better at things, not the quantity
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.980]   of things that you're actually going after.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.260]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.820]   Next question's from Craig.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.380]   I'm a college student trying to be more smart about how I study and organize my learning.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.380]   I'm relatively new to this stuff.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:26.020]   Strangely, most productivity tips on YouTube are about the top 10 to-do lists and note
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.020]   taking apps.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.260]   Will I be less effective if I don't use one of those apps?
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.940]   It seems like a lot of work and setup to learn all those apps to be efficient, and I dread
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.360]   thinking about the heavy lifting prep those apps require.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   What should I do?
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:43.920]   Well, I think my answer here at first is going to be ironic because you may be listening
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.920]   to this answer on YouTube, but I'm going to tell you in a second why what I'm about to
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.380]   say here is not oxymoronic.
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.880]   Don't use YouTube to get advice on studying.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:01.400]   When you're getting information, especially information on improving your life, you have
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.700]   to understand the incentive structures in place.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:13.200]   For people who are purely doing YouTube, so if you're a pure study habits YouTuber, the
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.320]   incentive structure is for views.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.320]   That's what you look about.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.320]   That's what you care about.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.800]   I want more views on my videos.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:27.260]   To get more views on your videos on YouTube, you have to work with the idiosyncratic properties
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:34.880]   of the recommendation algorithm, and you get into this feedback loop where your content
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:40.280]   morphs more and more towards what's giving you this better feedback from the algorithm.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.960]   After a while, it's the algorithm specifying your content.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.440]   You may be started out as a YouTuber saying, "I want to help students study better because
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.760]   this is an audience out there that cares about this."
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:58.160]   After six months of interacting with the algorithm, it's the top 10 to-do list apps or whatever
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.660]   because this is what's giving them the best view numbers.
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:06.180]   The advice might have very little to do, however, with the nuts and bolts of becoming a better
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.720]   student.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.940]   The incentive structure matters.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.480]   If you want to become a better student, and this is going to sound very self-serving,
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:17.020]   but I'm going to say, "Read my book, 'How to Become a Straight-A Student.'"
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.100]   Why is that better?
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.800]   What is the incentive structure of books?
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.820]   When you write a book like, "How to Become a Straight-A Student," let me tell you this
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.540]   from experience.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.740]   This is not a, "We're going to go hard out of the gate.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.020]   This is going to be a number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:35.500]   I'm going to be on the Today Show talking about this book, and every major podcaster
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.780]   wants to have me on."
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.000]   That is not the play when you write a book on student advice.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.020]   The play is, "This better work."
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:49.140]   Some people will buy this because they heard about it from me or saw it on a table.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.140]   I'm embarrassed to admit this, Jesse, but when that book came out, it was during my
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:57.820]   first year of grad school at MIT, I would sometimes go to the Harvard co-op, as they
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:03.620]   call it, the coop, and it was on tables, and I'd kind of hang around.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.140]   People would pick up the book and look at it, but that's how people discovered it at
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.140]   first.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.140]   I didn't have a social...
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.140]   There was no social media back then.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.900]   I wasn't on a big podcast.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.900]   People would find it on tables, and then it's all word of mouth.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.940]   What is going to make someone recommend a book to someone else?
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.820]   This worked.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.820]   This made me get better grades.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:24.820]   You should read it.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.140]   My kids' grades got better after they read this.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.220]   What you want to look for, if you want to align incentive structures with advice here,
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:36.900]   is where you want to find a book on student study habit advice that just had a quiet entry
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.900]   into the marketplace, and over time, sell, sell, sell, sells.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.500]   I just looked it up before the show.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:48.940]   I think the sales on "How to Become a Straight A Student" is approaching 250,000 copies.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.220]   A book that has never had any major promotion, has never been talked about on a single major
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.980]   podcast show, or had any footprint on social media.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.540]   That's all word of mouth.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.220]   There you verify the incentive there.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:06.540]   For me to make that book sell that many copies, I was obsessed about this better work.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.700]   What really works?
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:14.780]   Books have a better incentive structure surrounding their information than YouTube does.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.740]   You buy my book or any other book that has sold a lot of copies that focus on this topic,
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.300]   you're much more likely to get advice that works, and you're not going to hear anything
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.420]   about note-taking apps or to-do lists in that book.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.060]   My book gets right down to the brass tacks of what are the different academic tasks you
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.860]   have to do, what is the right way to do these?
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.700]   How do you take information from a textbook and learn it efficiently to the point that
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.100]   you can do well on a test?
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.260]   How do you write a paper?
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.780]   How do you break that down into multiple steps so that it's a good paper that you're going
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.980]   to get good grades on?
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.900]   How do you learn mathematics to the level that you can sit down for a mathematics exam
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.340]   and get a really good score on it?
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.740]   Well, here's exactly how you want to organize your notes.
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.680]   Here's how you should study.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:58.340]   These would make excessively boring YouTube videos from the perspective of the algorithm,
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.340]   but they also lead to notably high GPAs.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:06.940]   All right, so now let's come back to the oxymoronic fallacy early on.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.300]   Aren't you hearing advice now on YouTube?
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:15.060]   Well, here's how I exempt what we're doing here, is that if you're watching this on YouTube,
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.300]   what you are seeing is the video of a podcast.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.540]   The podcast is the game here.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.820]   We put the video of the podcast on YouTube.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.500]   Podcasting has a good incentive structure.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.340]   It's similar to books.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.100]   There is not an algorithm to please.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:37.820]   In other words, there's not a hard, inscrutable, complex feedback mechanism that drives your
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.280]   content in podcasting.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.060]   It is just like books.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:46.300]   If someone likes your show, they will tell someone else about it, and your audience grows
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.820]   a little bit.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:53.260]   And that's how podcasts grow, is people find what you're talking about to be effective
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:57.420]   enough that they will then go on to tell someone else about it.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.140]   So that's what I think saves us here, if you're watching this on YouTube, is that what we're
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.340]   trying to do is get more podcast listeners.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.340]   And I see that the exact same way as trying to get more book readers.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.900]   The stuff's got to work.
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:14.700]   We play some tricks with the thumbnails and the titles to try to get some algorithmic
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:21.340]   juice, our YouTube guy does that, but the content comes out of the podcast.
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.180]   So I think incentive structures matter, so keep that in mind.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:31.460]   So pure YouTubers are not necessarily a great source of advice on a lot of topics.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.500]   You want to find sources of advice where the incentive structure is for the advice to work.
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.820]   That's what's going to make it actually do better.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.860]   All right, let's keep rolling, Jesse.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.460]   What do we got next?
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.660]   Next question's from Emile, "I've reached a point in my career where I'm at the top
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.180]   level for my discipline.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.900]   I'm trying to figure out what to do next.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:53.140]   I want to learn something new, but I also don't want it to be random.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.760]   Any thoughts?"
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:59.420]   Start a YouTube channel, that'd be ironic.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:04.620]   You got to start a YouTube channel and crush that algorithm.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:09.700]   The key is, and Emile, I can't emphasize this enough, is to be really emphatic about asking
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:14.180]   people to crush that subscribe button, hit the bell notification button so that you can
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.220]   get your 5% bump in YouTube subscribers.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.180]   No, Emile, it's a good question.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:22.100]   It's a very hard question, and that's what I want to emphasize.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:26.180]   Figuring out what to get good at next, especially in a professional field, is a question that
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.880]   you should treat with a lot of respect because the answers aren't obvious.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.060]   This is actually good news.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.540]   Most people do not spend enough time trying to understand what is worth getting better
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:38.540]   at.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.380]   They learn things randomly, and some people randomly choose a skill that ends up to be
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.980]   really valuable and it really helps their career, and most people don't.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:51.660]   You can game this system by actually thinking about this question.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.420]   You're absolutely right to say, "I don't want to just learn something random."
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.420]   Don't.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.180]   Deconstruct your field.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.140]   Look at people who are farther ahead of you in your field, whose current position is set
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.040]   up you admire, and try to understand how they got there.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.520]   What were the key things they did that allowed them to move ahead?
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.340]   Was it particular numbers, knowledge of a new system?
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.700]   Did they take over a different niche?
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:19.420]   Get hard evidence about what matters in your field, and use that to make a really good
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:24.780]   educated bet on what's going to pay off well, and then put your energy on there.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:30.420]   Most people wander in their jobs through the landscape of possible skills, some of which
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.820]   have higher value in a sort of metaphorical fitness landscape here than others, and people
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:38.420]   just randomly walk around here and some people wander up the high hills.
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:43.760]   If you're being systematic, you can just go straight uphill and get a bigger return for
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   your efforts.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.840]   So I'm glad you asked that question in the middle because I'm going to say that's the
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.400]   right question to ask.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.020]   Don't be thrown by the fact that it's hard to answer.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.700]   That's what makes it important.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:57.260]   All right, let's see what we got next here.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:05.260]   Jesse, I am going to label this next question as this week's slow productivity corner question.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:11.300]   Let's get some slow productivity theme music, please.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:19.020]   For those who don't know, in honor of my book, Slow Productivity, which comes out in March,
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:24.380]   we like to have one question every episode that is relevant to my philosophy of slow
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.140]   productivity.
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:31.140]   If you want to find out more about that book and get an excerpt so you can dive into these
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.500]   ideas right away, go to calnewport.com/slow.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:38.500]   All right, Jesse, what is our slow productivity corner question of the day?
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.260]   All right, this question is from Gabrielle.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.360]   I'm 15 years old in school and learning app development for two months so I can launch
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.580]   a business I've been planning.
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.320]   Exams are coming up and I have a paper to write.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:54.020]   My deadline is to be able to code a high quality app by the start of the year.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:58.220]   Usually I wake up, do my routine, then code every day for two hours in the morning.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:02.700]   On days where I don't have school, I work for sessions of two hours and I take breaks
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:03.700]   in between.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:09.680]   On an ideal non-school day, I get in eight hours, but occasionally I'll only get six
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.220]   hours of coding done.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:15.620]   For people in situations similar to mine, what's the best way to focus on rapidly learning
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:21.300]   the skills necessary to do well in the industry/job you're trying to get into, even if you have
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.740]   large obligations that might take up most of the days of the year?
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.740]   Okay, so I'm already burnt out just listening to the question.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:33.660]   I mean, even with the freneticism of this question, I do this, but also this and sometimes
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:36.680]   these hours and how to get more hours.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.860]   What I'm going to suggest here is slowing down.
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:44.580]   All right, now here's the model I want you to think about is the model we talked about
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.860]   during the deep dive earlier in this episode.
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.860]   I gave this model for how do people learn complicated things.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:58.580]   It's this slow process of step, step, step, and each step requires time invested into
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:03.740]   a deliberate activity that pushes you to a new level of skill.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:09.180]   If you want to get really good at app development to the level where you could actually sustain
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:14.280]   a serious business, you've got a lot of steps in your future.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:20.940]   This is not the way that you're thinking about it, which I think aligns with the false model
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.460]   of skill acquisition we talked about in that deep dive.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:28.300]   This is not a situation where if you just get after it for a few months, you're going
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.840]   to be programming the next roadblocks.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.500]   You have a lot of these little steps you have to do and each one takes some time and there's
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.860]   a refractory period of recharging.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:40.740]   It's just not something you're going to be able to force.
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:47.020]   So I'm going to suggest you slow down the rate at which you learn how to do this.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.020]   You're a student.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.020]   You're in school.
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.020]   You have exams coming up.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.860]   You should be doing very little of this during exam time and then you have a little bit more
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:57.640]   come in during the after exams and then it slows back down again when it's back to another
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.340]   busy period during school.
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.340]   Now here's the thing.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:04.300]   In the short term, you will feel like you're making less progress and that's true.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:11.100]   If you take a slower approach, natural pace, so less at once, taking longer with ups and
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.940]   downs to your intensity, in the period of let's say the next three months, the slower
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:21.220]   approach will get you a lot less far than just getting after it like you're talking
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.220]   about here.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:25.540]   I want to get eight hours in, you know, each week and where can I find more time to code?
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.940]   So after three months, you will feel like you're going unnaturally slow and you'll be
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.720]   worse off.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:35.380]   Fast forward out to a year or two years, you will be in a much higher level of skill with
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:37.380]   the slower approach than the fast approach.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.380]   Why?
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.000]   Because the fast approach, you'll burn out after a few months trying to fit every hour
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.140]   doing coding.
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:46.360]   You're realizing you can't jump from here to be an expert app developer anyways.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.600]   It's going to be frustrating.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.880]   You only have so much time.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:53.240]   You're 15 and so you'll build up some basic skills and burn out and go back to like, can
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.480]   I just play video games or do one of these things where I can just like make easy progress
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.880]   and I don't want to bother with it.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.080]   Whereas the slow approach is sustainable.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:10.020]   Step step step, a year goes by, step, step, step, slow periods, faster periods, but always
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.160]   making over time progress up this ladder.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.200]   A year goes by, you're higher up these staircases, much higher than you were when you began.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.760]   Another year goes by.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:23.800]   Now you're at the top of a flight of metaphorical stairs where you're really able to program
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.600]   very professionally.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.720]   And as you're approaching college, you have a lot of options that's helping you get into
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.000]   technical schools.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.720]   It's opening up side hustle capabilities that are really cool.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.560]   Maybe it allows you to work part-time and pay all your college bills.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:42.160]   Like all these things are open up, but it took two years of step, step, step.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:46.720]   There's a key slow productivity principle, take longer, vary your pace.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.260]   And it comes up again and again.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:54.320]   In my book, I talk about example after example, there's a whole part of the book, work at
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.520]   a natural pace, or I get into this.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.480]   People who do cool things work this way.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:03.240]   They don't just decide, I'm going to write Hamilton.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.920]   I'm going to become a great novelist.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.560]   I'm going to become a great artist.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.880]   Let's get after it for three months and then I'm there.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.360]   Some of that idea that this is how people get really good at things.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.920]   And I think this is made, I think this is true.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.000]   People might think it's an exaggeration.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.760]   I think for young people, it comes from video games.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:25.920]   Video games are expertly calibrated to require like a month or two of, you get better each
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.040]   day you play it.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.720]   And after a month or two, you've mastered it.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:35.120]   Like the cycle of a big video game is one to three months to finish the game, playing
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.720]   fairly regularly, but not all the time.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.480]   So we're used to this cycle of, you know, I first started playing whatever the game
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.040]   is, Call of Duty, Black Ops, and I was really bad at it.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:47.320]   Then after three months, I do pretty well when I'm playing online.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:51.200]   And then we sort of build this mental model about how long it takes to get good at things.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.060]   But most things that are valuable take a lot longer.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.560]   If you could get good at them in three months, a lot of people would do that to extract a
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.280]   value and then the value of it would plummet.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:05.180]   So things take time, take longer, vary your pace.
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.800]   This is a patience game.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:12.640]   But sustainability over time is going to aggregate more skill than having these temporary bursts
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.840]   that then fizzle out.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.520]   All right, so that's why I'm going to call this my slow productivity question of the
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:22.320]   day, because slowing down, though frustrating right now, is going to get you to a much cooler
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.360]   place one to two years from now.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.680]   All right, there we go, Jesse, the slow productivity corner.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.320]   I feel good.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.960]   All right, let's do a call.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.040]   Do we have a call?
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.040]   Yes, we do.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.520]   All right, let's see what we have here.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:49.920]   Hey, Cal, this is Karan, and I am back in the cabin doing my annual tradition where
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:59.040]   I find a place, submerge myself in solitude and read books and just think deeply about
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.480]   how I want to live my life.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:07.080]   And I am reading currently, one of the books that I'm reading in my rotation is So Good
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.360]   They Can't Ignore You.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:14.600]   It's one of the last two books in your canon that I have not read fully.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:21.160]   So as I'm reading the book, it hit me, and you've said this in a previous episode, where
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:26.960]   all of the books that you have written address an exigence that you are currently conflicted
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:27.960]   with.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:33.360]   So I'm using that term kind of loosely from bitter rhetorical situation where there is
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:41.240]   a problem that the mass culture is dealing with, and you're the speaker that has the
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:46.000]   "solution" for that, and then you're dealing with certain constraints.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.600]   And so So Good They Can't Ignore You, you're fighting against the past and hypothesis.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:56.920]   Deep work, how do I get now the skills I need to build up that career capital?
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:03.200]   And I can go so on and so on with digital minimalism and a world without email.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:09.320]   But to not belabor the point and to get to my question, I'm wondering, how does slow
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:14.520]   productivity address the exigence you're currently dealing with?
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:19.640]   And so I see it in So Good They Can't Ignore You, you've always in the back of your mind
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:23.600]   been thinking about this slow productivity, like, how do I see myself in five years and
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:28.620]   10 years building this thing I need now, instead of thinking of the immediate moment.
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:34.040]   So you've always been kind of building up to this, but I'm curious, how does slow productivity
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:38.240]   address the exigence you are trying to work with now?
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.240]   Thanks, Kal.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.960]   Well, Karan, that's a great question.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:49.480]   I can tell you exactly where that came from, where slow productivity comes from as a book.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:53.840]   So what we get before is let's combine So Good They Can't Ignore You, deep work, and
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.020]   a world without email.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:59.320]   Let's combine those into a trilogy of sorts, right?
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:03.500]   Because as you mentioned, So Good They Can't Ignore You was me confronting the passion
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:11.580]   hypothesis as part of, in my own life, answering the question as a postdoc at MIT, how do you
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.240]   cultivate a career that's going to be a source of passion?
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.260]   That was a really important question to me at the time, because I was about to make a
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:23.680]   career decision, which might be the last career decision I ever made, setting myself on the
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.700]   tenure track, and so I really wanted to understand how do you cultivate a working life that you
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:34.500]   really love, and So Good They Can't Ignore You came out of that quest.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.500]   One of the big answers from So Good They Can't Ignore You was get really good at things that
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.780]   are rare and valuable, and then you get autonomy over your working life.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.100]   That led to deep work.
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.420]   How do I get really good at things that are rare and valuable?
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:50.420]   Oh, in the type of stuff I do, in the sort of elite knowledge economy, unbroken concentration
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:53.080]   is the only thing that's producing the real value.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.720]   Nothing else just gets in the way.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.180]   So I have to really cultivate concentration as a tier one skill if I'm going to get really
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:02.700]   good at things so I can leverage the effects I talked about in So Good They Can't Ignore
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:07.220]   You and gain autonomy over my career and steer it towards something that's really satisfying.
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:12.140]   Well, it's frustrating to try to cultivate concentration.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.140]   There's a lot you can do on your own that I talk about in deep work, but it seems like
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:18.160]   I was in the working world now, I'm a professor.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:22.080]   The whole knowledge work apparatus is built around distracting you with all these emails
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.460]   and meetings and chats.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.960]   And so a world without email was like, let's get deep on where did that come from?
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.200]   Is it really damaging?
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.200]   Yes.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.920]   Is this way of working fundamental?
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.520]   No.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.880]   Is it possible to do something different?
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:36.880]   Yes.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.080]   So there's a primal scream of frustration with email and meetings.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.080]   That's where that book came from.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.080]   All right.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   So we have that trilogy.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:47.340]   That takes me from, that's basically my thirties.
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:53.360]   So Good They Can't Ignore You came out right around the time I turned 30 and A World Without
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.440]   Email came out right before I turned 40.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.080]   So that kind of covered my thirties.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:05.280]   How do I enter into a world of work, get after it, succeed, gain control, build something
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.680]   that could be a real source of passion?
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.680]   And I succeeded in this.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.840]   I got tenure early.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.840]   I've got this great professorship at Georgetown.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:12.840]   My books are doing well.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.400]   I'm a pretty successful writer.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.400]   Now where am I in life?
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.640]   Well, now I'm in my young forties and I have kids that are no longer babies or toddlers
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.480]   where we're just sort of in survival mode of like, how do we just make sure they're
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.800]   fed and like take them so they're distracted?
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.240]   Now I have elementary age school kids.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.200]   I have all boys.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:34.040]   I'm beginning to notice that like the thing they need at this age more than anything else
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.560]   is time with their dad.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.200]   Like it's really, really important.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:41.460]   Like this is, you know, especially for dads, like where parenting really takes off.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:45.280]   And the next question that comes up is, okay, so now what's next?
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:49.740]   How do I continue to do work that I'm really proud of?
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:55.220]   How do I take advantage of whatever skills I have cultivated or been bestowed to continue
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:58:00.420]   to produce stuff that improves the world that makes my time here worthwhile, but in a way
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:05.180]   where I also am able to invest a lot of time into my kids and community?
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:09.480]   This is a middle age is the time where this is so critical.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.820]   Slow productivity emerged out of that question.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:19.340]   I needed to switch my mindset away from the mindset that got me tenure early, away from
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:26.860]   the mindset that has produced whatever I have, 70 or 80 peer reviewed papers, 5,000 citations,
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.580]   three best paper awards in my field.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.340]   My eighth book is about to come out, right?
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:38.300]   How do I find a sustainable pace now going forward, where I continue to produce stuff
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:42.380]   I'm proud of, but I'm not having to produce at, you know, what I'm doing here is doing
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.460]   it at a really high rate.
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:48.300]   What I'm doing here is just impressing you with the sort of sheer volume of what I'm
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:49.300]   doing.
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:55.900]   Slow productivity, you can think of Quran as the answer to that question, a reconfiguration
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:00.980]   of productivity that is based around producing stuff that really makes you proud as part
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:04.340]   of a life that is really deep and interesting and varied.
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.660]   So that was my personal motivation for the book.
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:11.300]   There is also, just like with all my other books, it's not just what I'm going through.
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:15.380]   It is also what the culture writ large is going through.
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.700]   And this also, of course, informs slow productivity.
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.420]   And I get into this in the book.
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:24.180]   In fact, I get into this in the introduction to the book, which is what we've just made
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:27.040]   available as the excerpt I was talking about earlier.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:32.860]   So if you go to, what was the URL, calnewport.com/slow, the excerpts you'll download is of the introduction
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:36.660]   where I make this case clear, like the cultural case for slow productivity.
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:42.220]   But essentially what happened is in the pandemic, people realized we have no good definition
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:44.420]   for productivity in knowledge work.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:49.500]   We're not measuring metrics and seeing like, does this way of working make us more effective?
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:54.220]   We have this nonsense heuristic we call pseudo productivity, which just says more work is
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:55.580]   better than less.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:57.420]   This is making us miserable.
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:58.940]   This is not sustainable.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:04.080]   We need a new definition of productivity as the knowledge sector writ large that's much
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.700]   more sustainable than just do as much as you can, more is better than less.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:10.660]   So there's a cultural question I'm answering with this book.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:15.220]   What is a sustainable definition of productivity for knowledge work in general?
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:21.780]   But there's also a personal question I'm answering, which is, what do I do now in my forties?
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:27.100]   How do I keep producing good work without having to work all the time, without having
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:32.260]   to be so hard, without having, like I talk about in the final chapters of deep work,
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.380]   I talk about the exhaustion of writing deep work at the same time I was trying to get
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.620]   tenure at the same time that my second kid was born.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.220]   So slow productivity answered that personal question as well.
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:46.460]   So if you're thinking about, I run a business and how do I rethink productivity?
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.460]   So I'm not stressed.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:52.620]   The book would be for you, but also if you're thinking about how do I think about my life
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:57.380]   in the longterm where I'm using my gifts, but also enjoying the gifts of life that go
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.300]   beyond just what you're doing in work.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:02.540]   The book is deeply personal in that way as well.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:05.060]   So we kind of got like an extra slow productivity corner, Jesse.
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.060]   We did.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.340]   Do we get, I think we, I think we get the music one more time because of that is what
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.340]   I'm saying.
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:18.860]   Any excuse to play it.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:19.860]   All right.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:20.860]   Let's do a case study.
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:25.420]   This is where you and my listeners send in examples of you putting the type of things
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.860]   we talked about on this show into practice, and you give us a sort of report from the
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:33.700]   trenches as it were about what actually happened in your life.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:39.020]   This case study comes from Andrew and you said, I thought you might possibly be interested
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:45.860]   in hearing a bit about the slow productivity affinity group that I formed at my university
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:51.340]   in January of 2023, I put out a call for those interested in joining the group, which I described
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:55.300]   fairly briefly as a group designed to bring together Butler faculty and staff who wish
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:00.020]   to develop an approach to work that is sustainable so that we can produce output that is of high
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.940]   quality, but also of humane quantity.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:07.160]   Our goals include providing members with resources, opening up discussions and exchanging ideas
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.740]   for sustainable, productive work.
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:13.620]   The impetus for the group was my appreciation of your books and your podcast, 30 people
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:17.980]   from across the university and in various roles expressed interest, which is very good
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.620]   for a university of our size.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.420]   I added all these people to a page I created through our learning management system so
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:27.580]   they could access the resources I put there, which included among other things, a description
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:32.340]   of the basic idea, links to articles, book recommendations, videos, and podcasts, a bit
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:36.620]   about writing accountability groups, a module for the exchange of ideas, suggestions for
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:41.280]   good places to work often on campus and an open discussion forum.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.420]   As one might expect from any academic group, participation varied widely.
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.860]   Some people never really engaged, but some appear to check in on the online resources
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:56.420]   periodically and others regularly attended a monthly Zoom meeting where we commiserated,
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.060]   shared challenges and successes.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:02.300]   I was even given a small budget, $500 with which several of us met for lunch on more
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.300]   than one occasion.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:07.180]   And I purchased about $250 in books for our lending library.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.140]   Three of us formed a writing accountability group and all three of us found it helped
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:14.980]   increase writing productivity during the semester.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:18.100]   Going forward, I'd love to get more interest and engagement.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:21.420]   That said, it's clear that some people are loathe to commit to anything that suggests
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.980]   that you'll have to do activities.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.180]   These people I would describe as being more interested in the slow aspect of the group
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.020]   and in particular, they seemed more interested in discussing burnout, work-life balance and
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.460]   related ideas.
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:35.620]   But if you were interested in learning more about the writing group, even if they didn't
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:40.060]   participate this time, I'd like to put together some workshops where folks could attend and
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:43.820]   perhaps do a few exercises here and there with the idea that they might gradually embrace
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.500]   more ideas of slow productivity.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:52.340]   Well, first of all, I love that idea and maybe this is something I should encourage more
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:59.020]   once the book comes out, creating your own groups in your place of work to discuss the
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.400]   ideas behind slow productivity.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.020]   So Andrew, I'm hoping when the book actually comes out, it will really help this working
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:09.660]   group go forward because it's going to be a much clearer framework than trying to piece
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:14.340]   together ideas from things I've talked about on the podcast and in articles.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:19.380]   But I think it's important that you're talking to each other and I know you're noticing with
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:25.100]   maybe a little bit of frustration this divide between the people who focus on the slow aspect
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:30.260]   of slow productivity and the people who focus on the productivity aspect, but both are really
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.260]   important.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:36.020]   And actually, what I've found working on this topic is that for a lot of people, just to
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:42.820]   get out the slow piece, just to express their frustration about not being able to slow down
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:48.740]   or the difficulties of not being able to slow down is a really important first step.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:53.940]   Work can really be somewhat deranging, this arrangement we have, which is more is better
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.580]   than less, and it's up to you to figure out how much to do, go.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:02.860]   It just puts people in this impossible situation where they have to constantly be arguing against
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:06.740]   themselves, more work or more other things in my life.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.580]   You have to wage war between the other parts of your life and work.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:14.980]   This is one of the real negative outcomes of making productivity almost entirely personal.
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:19.260]   This is something I document in detail in the book, how this happened and why it's a
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.260]   problem.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.580]   So there's a lot of real frustration there, and some people have more of this than others.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:27.180]   If you have a family, it's worse than if you don't.
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.700]   It's often worse for women than it is for men.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:33.060]   So some people are dealing with a lot more of this than other people.
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:37.780]   So being able to just express that frustration first, I think is really important.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:42.300]   And then moving on to, so what can we do systematically to make this better?
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.820]   That then becomes the next step.
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:45.220]   So anyways, this is cool.
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.820]   Hopefully my book will help.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:52.260]   It would be funny if the end of this case study was, "And all 30 of these people have
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.260]   since been fired."
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:58.060]   It would be less successful, but I'm sure this will be useful.
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:01.620]   You know, I used to run these groups way back when, when I wrote student advice books.
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:08.420]   I had this program called Study Hacks on Campus, and we had like 30 college campuses.
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.300]   Students would start up student groups following my curriculum, where they would just get together
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.460]   regularly to talk through studying and how to study and what they're having issues with
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:20.340]   and their frustrations with it.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.780]   And it helped.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.300]   And a lot of what they did was strategic, but a lot of what they did was just support,
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.580]   and a lot of what they did is venting.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.580]   So I like this idea.
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:27.580]   I might steal it.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:32.340]   Maybe when Slow Productivity comes out, we'll put out some guides for how to run your own
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.820]   Slow Productivity group.
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:38.460]   I think step number one, there's going to be two key steps, definitely going to be two
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:43.120]   key steps in my advice for starting Slow Productivity groups.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:48.860]   Step number one is important, regardless of the size of the group, that you spend at least
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:50.780]   $3,000 on copies of Slow Productivity.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.740]   That's going to be step number one.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:53.740]   I think that's important.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:07:00.060]   Step number two, and Jesse agrees with this, you need to spend at least 15 to 20 minutes
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:04.140]   per group meeting listening to the Slow Productivity music.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.140]   Come on, Jesse.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:06.140]   Hit me.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.140]   Hit me.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.140]   There we go.
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:09.140]   There we go.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.140]   All right.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.140]   Enough of that nonsense.
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:15.900]   Thanks for the case study, Andrew.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:16.900]   I really appreciated it.
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.940]   I want to take a brief moment to talk about another sponsor that helps make this show
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:24.220]   possible, and that is Element, L-M-N-T.
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:30.500]   Now, let me say, I am very happy to have Element back as a sponsor.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:35.780]   They were a sponsor earlier in the show's history, and when they sent me those initial
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:42.540]   free samples of their product, I got hooked, and I have been using this product daily ever
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:43.540]   since.
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:49.260]   I'm really happy to have them back as a sponsor because I am actually one of their big customers.
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:50.260]   What is Element?
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:54.980]   It's a zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix born from the growing body of research revealing
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:08:01.780]   that optimal health outcomes occur at sodium levels two to three times government recommendations.
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.060]   Each of their little stick packs is sort of like a sugar packet.
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:09.660]   You mix it into a water bottle, and it gives you a meaningful dose of electrolytes, but
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:16.580]   it does so, and here's what's key, free of sugar, artificial color, or any other dodgy
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.260]   ingredients.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:22.100]   Element is formulated for anyone on a mission to restore health through hydration.
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:26.100]   It's perfectly suited for athletes, folks who are fasting, or those following keto,
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.300]   low-carb, whole food, or paleo diets.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.480]   It's used by U.S. Olympic athletes.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:39.220]   It's used by the NFL, the NBA, the NHL, Navy SEALs teams, FBI sniper teams, and yes, also
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:44.820]   podcasters who like to program Christmas lights with microcontrollers.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:48.380]   The way I use Element is after I work out, it's how I rehydrate.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:51.620]   I don't want sugar, but I need more than just water.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:52.620]   It does it for me.
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:55.540]   I also use Element if I've been out late the night before.
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:59.700]   Maybe I was at a party or an event and I was talking and not drinking enough water.
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:04.020]   Element in the morning is how I get that hydration back, how I get those electrolytes back.
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:07.540]   I love the way it tastes, and I love the fact that there is no sugar in it.
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.820]   There's no artificial flavorings.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:14.140]   It just gets you basically salty water that you like to drink.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:19.740]   There's a new feature I want to tell you about, which is the Element chocolate medley featuring
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:22.580]   chocolate mint, chocolate chai, and chocolate raspberry.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.180]   These are Element mixes that are meant to be enjoyed hot.
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:30.740]   So now that we're in the winter season, if you want a hot drink to get your electrolytes
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:33.780]   considered using Element hot.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:46.420]   Here's the good news for you, if you go to drinkelement.com/deep, that's drinkelement.com/deep,
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:50.100]   you can get a free Element sample pack with any order you make.
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:54.300]   So whatever you order, you can get this free sample pack to try everything that Element
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.400]   has to offer.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.180]   You can try Element totally risk-free.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.140]   If you don't like it, they will give it back.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.940]   You can give it to a salty friend and they will give you your money back.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:03.940]   No questions asked.
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:07.300]   They have a very low return rate and a very high reorder rate, but this is completely
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:08.740]   risk-free.
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.560]   They send new boxes and refund immediately.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.420]   They consistently hear that Element customer service is the best, no BS customer service
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:17.420]   around.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.300]   In fact, if you hear a complaint about Element from your community, or you don't like anything
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.700]   about it, you can actually just email them directly and they'll get back to you.
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.820]   So this is a company that cares about their customers.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:28.820]   So give it a try.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:34.740]   So drinkelementlmnt.com/deep, make sure you add, get that free sample pack with whatever
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:38.900]   order you get and enjoy a saltier hydration experience.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.140]   All right, let's get back to the show.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.140]   All right.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:45.860]   So this brings us to our third and final segment of the show today.
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:49.060]   Like I do every month, the beginning of a new month, I want to talk about the books
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.500]   I read during the month preceding.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:57.980]   So because it's January, we'll be talking about December, 2023 books that I read.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.340]   All right.
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:06.020]   Book number one, Home Economics by Wendell Berry.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.580]   This is an essay collection from Wendell Berry.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:11.820]   I found this in a little free library around Tacoma park.
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:17.340]   It's one of his most famous, I think, essay collections because it includes some of his
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.140]   most famous essays in particular.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:24.820]   It has his really well-known two economies essays in this particular collection.
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:26.300]   I'm a big Wendell Berry fan.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:31.900]   I think Wendell Berry has influenced now two generations, the generation older than me
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:37.660]   and my generation, two generations of people who think somewhat radically about reconfiguring
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:42.780]   our relationship with the world, with work, with the environment.
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.900]   He's had influence on a lot of people.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.620]   You see a lot of Wendell Berry, for example, in Bill McKibben, you see a lot of Wendell
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:55.980]   Berry, for example, in Michael Pollan, very influential writer left his NYU, we've talked
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:01.820]   about on the show before, but left his NYU professorship to move back to Kentucky to
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:08.820]   farm on this land near where he grew up farming without gas power, using horses and really
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.540]   gets into old school agriculture.
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:15.720]   So he is the OG of thinking about intentional living and minimalism.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.140]   So great collection of essays.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.140]   I enjoyed it.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.140]   I hope you have it as well.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.140]   All right.
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:23.900]   Next, I went to the opposite direction.
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:29.500]   So if Wendell Berry is plowing fields with horses, let's go the opposite direction and
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.420]   read a book about streaming media.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:38.340]   In particular, I read Peter Biskin's book, Pandora's Box.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:42.380]   And this is a history, sort of a TikTok history, you know, like step-by-step, they hired this
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:46.580]   person, this happened of the prestige TV era.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:54.180]   So starting with HBO's emergence as a producer of prestige, original content, following what
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:13:00.480]   happened with the basic cable channels like FX and AMC that also followed to start doing
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.580]   prestige TV leading up through the rise of the digital steamer.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:12.300]   So Netflix, et cetera, taking on this mantle, I think it's a good, a good TikTok history.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.780]   If you want to know who are the people involved, what was the timeline involved with these
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.140]   coming up and down?
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:18.140]   What were the shows?
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.380]   When did they put out?
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.500]   How do we sequence this?
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:25.220]   When did Mad Men come out versus The Sopranos versus The Shield?
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:28.100]   Like when did this stuff all time out?
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.500]   And some of the characters are interesting as well.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:35.700]   So it's not one of these books that's really brings you to some like new insider understanding
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:39.980]   with really cool access to sources, but it accomplishes the goal.
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:47.220]   It's like a competent journalist who brings you into this world and explains how it unfolds.
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.220]   So it was a cool book.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.220]   I'm glad I read it.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.220]   I have a lot of thoughts.
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:54.920]   I won't bore you with them now, but I'm building this theory on the future of independent media.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.580]   That is stuff like we're doing here.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:01.440]   And I have this theory is going to end up a lot more like linear TV than we realize.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.820]   And it's going to be a lot less connected to recommendation algorithms than we realize,
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:08.260]   but I'll hold the details of that for another time.
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.780]   All right.
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:12.740]   Then I read Where the Deer and the Antelope Play.
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:18.140]   This is the latest book by Nick Offerman, the actor you probably know from Parks and
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:21.580]   Recreation is probably what he's most known for, Ron Swanson, but there's a bunch of other
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.980]   shows as well.
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:26.780]   Uneven is what I would say.
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:30.900]   I really like Nick Offerman's first book.
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.480]   I think it was called Paddle Your Own Canoe or something like this.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:38.600]   This book was a little bit more uneven, where Nick is great and he has long sections of
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:44.760]   this book where he's great is where he's in this Mark Twain style of telling a story about
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.600]   something that happened to him.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.040]   Like, let me walk through this story.
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:55.360]   And when he really gets into it, he's a fantastic storyteller and it's warm and it's human and
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.920]   it's funny and it's unexpected.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.200]   I think he's as good at doing this type of storytelling as anyone doing it right now.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:11.280]   The standout in this book is his long section on when him and his wife, Megan Malawi, Malini
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:18.520]   or Malawi, the actress from Will and Grace buying an RV during the pandemic and going
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.520]   on this long road trip.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.720]   It's fantastic storytelling.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.160]   So some of it's really good.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:28.360]   Some of the stories seem like they just weren't that good of stories and weren't that interesting.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:34.080]   The thing that was kind of annoying about this book is he keeps switching over to this
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:40.840]   mode of politics, but it's not interesting politics.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:49.120]   It's like the most cringy cliche of a Hollywood bubble person who's read some things on left-wing
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:58.000]   Twitter and has given you the simplest, most completely un-nuanced, convinced, makes everyone
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.040]   else cringe, simplistic view of things.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.800]   That part's not helping the book.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:08.160]   And maybe this is just because I'm in Washington, DC, so everyone's politics here is pretty
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.960]   nuanced because they work and live in this world.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:11.960]   But it was so simplistic.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.120]   I don't care where you are on the spectrum.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.120]   You could be very progressive.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.640]   You're just going to find a way he talks about these things.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.120]   It's so simplistic and he's so sure.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:25.680]   It's like he just discovered, like someone just gave him a copy of Imbran Kendi's book
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.520]   and showed him some like, here's 20 tweets from progressive Twitter.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.680]   And he's like, oh, it's just the simplest possible regurgitation of these things.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:40.040]   And it comes across as, you know, it's a little cringy because it's just, I don't know.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.040]   It's like, why is this here?
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.040]   You're such a great storyteller.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:45.080]   You're not a great political thinker.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:50.480]   This is going to, A, whatever half of your readers are Republican are going to just hate
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:56.280]   the book and then 80% of your left wing readers are going to be kind of like, this is pretty,
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:58.800]   this is like my seventh grader coming home.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800]   So I don't know.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.480]   I didn't like the, I didn't think the, the politics were not done well and seemed out
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.480]   of place.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.920]   And it kept taking you out of the storytelling.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.560]   Who knows?
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:16.080]   We're so, what's the word here in DC, cynical on politics, right?
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:19.080]   You can't, you can't have simplistic politics here because the person you're talking to
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:24.540]   is probably the legislative director for the Senator that, you know, uh, oppose that bill.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.680]   And so if it's just like, Oh, well, yeah.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.680]   Read his first book though.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:32.480]   First, if you haven't, if you're read, I think it's called paddle your own canoe.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.480]   It tells his whole story.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.480]   It's fantastic.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.480]   I love Nick Offerman.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.480]   His story is great.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.480]   All right.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.240]   Um, the next two books are by the same writer.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:48.000]   The first book I really recommend, it's called who wrote the Bible by Richard Elliott Friedman.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.200]   Let me tell you why I recommend this.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.080]   This book is doing something that is incredibly hard to do well.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.280]   And when I see it done well, I really appreciate it here.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:06.060]   We have a scholar who is an expert on a very complicated scholarly topic, which is, uh,
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:09.300]   so it's, it's textual biblical criticism.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:15.840]   This is a, the, a, uh, a secular study of the Bible that started in the 19th century
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.280]   for the most part, it's called the critical method.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:24.460]   It came out of Germany that uses analysis of the words in the Bible to, uh, break it
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:25.460]   out into different authors.
[01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:26.460]   Right?
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:31.080]   So you can study various attributes of the words that are used.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:36.600]   You can also study various attributes about, um, the Hebrew, how old is this version of
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.600]   Hebrew?
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.400]   And you can pretty clearly identify that when you're looking at the first five books of
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:46.120]   the Bible, so the, the Pentioch or the Torah, that there is five different authors involved
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.400]   and you can just get here from text analysis.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:53.280]   This is a really complicated field with, because you're, you're debating over and it shifts
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.080]   around is this part of this author or not.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:01.040]   And we're looking at a lot of, uh, ancient Hebrew etymology, really complicated.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.000]   He makes it not only accessible, but it reads like a detective novel.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.320]   He has somehow abled a Friedman here.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.000]   This was a very, this book is old, but I think it came out in the eighties, huge bestseller
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.160]   because it's really well written.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.040]   He's able to just get to the core threat.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.360]   This is where we are now in the field, and I'm not going to get caught up in the minutiae.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.280]   And then this happened and he, and he, he writes with, uh, rhetorical questions that
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.360]   he answers and the whole thing just moves.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:33.180]   So anytime I see a scholar taking an incredibly complicated topic and without diluting the
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:38.240]   complexity of the topic, making it compelling to read for the lay reader, I tip my cap because
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.200]   I know how hard it is.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.160]   So even if you're not interested in the topic, it's, it's a pretty cool book.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.880]   Um, the topic itself is pretty cool.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.080]   I didn't know much about this, this type of historical criticism.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:53.600]   What they figured out basically is, uh, this is this new generation and new, I mean, he's
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:59.840]   old, but this generation of scholars from the seventies onwards figured out how to look
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.040]   at what historically, what was being said, the historical context of what was being said,
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:09.680]   and figure out where these authors were, were from.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:14.240]   And it becomes kind of interesting because you say like, look, the way the words that
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:21.200]   the author of this part of the Bible is using to talk about X, Y, or Z makes it clear that
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:26.680]   they must be from the period, for example, before the, uh, the kingdom split in the two
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:30.820]   kingdoms of Israel and Judah, they must be from the North because the way they're talking
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:33.960]   about this is a subtle dig at what was happening in the South.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:38.800]   Like it turns out, if you actually look at what's being said here, you can actually figure
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.740]   out, Oh, you were probably are from this period of time living in this part of, uh, this part
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:44.740]   of the near East.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:50.600]   And so they can actually pretty closely figure out where these different writers were in
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:54.080]   time and where they were in location.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:59.960]   In some cases you, you can even get to a particular in the visual, like the, the, the Deuteronomist
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:05.000]   maybe were, you know, um, the redacted Ezra's involved in redacting all of this.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.480]   Like it's really cool as completely secular history, um, but complicated as such a complicated
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:14.680]   field in the book reads like, you know, the mystery novel.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.920]   So I was really impressed.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:22.160]   So the next book I wrote was a follow-up written by Richard Elliott Friedman called the Exodus.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.920]   And it's about all the most recent scholarship using this method to try to understand what
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:30.880]   do we actually know about the book of Exodus?
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:35.200]   What really, um, what can we figure out about what really happened there by studying the
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:41.480]   text itself and why are there, there's a Egyptian names are used here, but not here.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:47.640]   The song of the sea mentions, you know, mentions, uh, this, but doesn't mention that the, the,
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:51.720]   you know, so it's this complicated analysis of like, what is being said or not being said,
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.420]   trying to put in the historical context.
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:58.100]   And he has this whole theory, which I think is widely, but not universally subscribed
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:06.860]   that the book of Exodus is probably describing a, uh, a particular band of probably the Levites
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:14.380]   who so not the entire, uh, Jewish people, the all 12 tribes, but one group of people
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:19.020]   did leave Egypt led by someone named Moses.
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:27.300]   They then brought the, the, the Exodus story, um, to the broader Jewish people at the time,
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.260]   which then integrated into a national story.
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:33.660]   So it wasn't, you know, 2 million or whatever the number was, uh, the whole kingdom of Israel
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:38.620]   and Judah leaving Egypt, it might've been a smaller group than brought that story that
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:41.460]   was then adopted as the national story.
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:45.500]   So it's like this really interesting, you get down to the details of, uh, who mentions
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.740]   who where and how this time's up.
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.740]   It was really cool.
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:57.580]   I love historical historical scholarship presented as a mystery, figuring this out and this evidence
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.580]   accrued here.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:22:59.580]   And it's not this.
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:01.540]   And again, his style has lots of rhetorical questions.
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:02.540]   So why not this?
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:04.420]   Well, this is why we don't think this, but what about this?
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.260]   Yeah, this is a pretty good piece of evidence.
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.260]   What about that?
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:08.900]   Well, this is kind of a problem, but it's what we think is going on.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:14.540]   So you get like this insight into this really complicated bit of scholarship where you have
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:19.780]   to spend your whole life mastering archaic Hebrew to even get your shoes on and you can
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.180]   get a glimpse into this reading a 200 page book.
[01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:29.140]   So I, I love both those books who wrote the Bible and the Exodus, you gotta be an expert
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:30.140]   to write those books.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.220]   All right, everyone.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:32.220]   That's what we got.
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:34.020]   Those are my December books.
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:36.660]   First episode of the new year in the bag.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:37.900]   Thank you for listening.
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:40.980]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.580]   And until then, as always stay deep.
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:50.620]   Hey, so if you enjoyed our discussion today about learning hard things, I think you might
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:59.020]   also like episode 275, which gives a general system for achieving hard goals.
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.880]   So check that out.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:06.740]   So the question I want to dive into today is how do you follow through on transformative
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:07.940]   goals?
