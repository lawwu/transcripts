[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.680]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.240]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.400]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.360]   and today we're gonna help you save money on taxes.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.760]   Now, I think we can all agree
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.560]   that taxes are an important part of our society,
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.160]   but with the tax code currently at over 4 million words,
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.400]   which by the way is about four times longer
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.200]   than all seven Harry Potter books combined,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.560]   it is no surprise that finding all the completely legal ways
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.960]   to optimize and lower our taxes is no easy feat.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.240]   So I wanted to invite my friend Ankur Nagpal,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.560]   the founder and CEO of Cary, to join me
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.700]   because I've been scouring the internet
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.120]   for the best content on 2023 tax optimization,
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.080]   and I kept landing on workshops he's done.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.520]   We're gonna cover ways that anyone can offset
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.380]   their W-2 income, maximize their deductions,
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.800]   save taxes on investments, and so much more.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.920]   At the end, we'll also cover tax savings
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.260]   for business owners, and my goal is for you
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.160]   to find at least one tax strategy in this episode
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.820]   that you can use yourself.
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.140]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.640]   Did you know that electrolyte deficiency or imbalance
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.980]   can cause headaches, cramps, fatigue,
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.040]   brain fog, and weakness?
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.800]   Well, our sponsor today, Element,
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.380]   helps anyone stay hydrated without the sugar
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.120]   and other dodgy ingredients found
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.880]   in popular electrolyte and sports drinks.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.280]   I've been enjoying Element for the past year
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.220]   because it's a zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.340]   born from the growing body of research
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.860]   revealing that optimal health outcomes
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.400]   occur at sodium levels two to three times
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.260]   government recommendations.
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.020]   Element is formulated for anyone on a mission
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.540]   to restore health through hydration,
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.620]   and even works when you're fasting
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.060]   or on a keto, low-carb, whole food, or paleo diet.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.860]   And while you can always enjoy Element Cold,
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.500]   their new chocolate medley,
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.780]   which includes chocolate mint, chocolate chai,
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.220]   and chocolate raspberry,
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.020]   is actually designed to be enjoyed hot.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.980]   Element is used by everyone from Olympic athletes
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.700]   to Navy SEAL teams to everyday parents.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.420]   And if you're not sure it's for you,
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.700]   don't worry because Element offers
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.780]   no questions asked refunds
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.500]   so you can try it totally risk-free.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.380]   And right now, Element is offering
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.140]   a free sample pack with any purchase.
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.140]   That's eight single-serving packets
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.380]   free with any Element order.
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.180]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors.

[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.620]   - Ankur, thank you for being here.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.600]   - I'm excited to do this, let's go.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.440]   - So you and I now, from the workshops I've watched,
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.740]   from the conversations we've had,
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.740]   share a passion for optimizing our finances.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.480]   We both started companies in the space.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.900]   Congratulations, yours is still in existence.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.260]   - Yeah, I mean, if you had told me, you know,
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.780]   10 years ago, this is what I'd be doing, I'd be shocked.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.500]   I mean, it kind of takes like learning from your mistakes
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.620]   to get to this point.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.740]   But yeah, I've spent the last year and a half
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.900]   diving deep into this world
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.500]   and now it's something I quite enjoy.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.060]   - So I've seen you do a couple workshops
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.300]   on saving money on taxes as a business owner,
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.560]   as a just normal person who doesn't own a business,
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.580]   and lots of things.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.960]   I wanna dive down all these rabbit holes
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.020]   and have this episode, for people listening,
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.320]   really be about all the different ways
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.900]   that you can take advantage, not of like breaking the law,
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.300]   but actually finding ways that other people
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.940]   are optimizing their taxes so you can do it too.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.860]   I think you share a belief that like,
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.540]   we should pay our taxes.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.380]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.060]   I mean, it's so funny, right?
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.860]   Every time I do these workshops, we have two types of people.
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.160]   One type of person is like, dude, just pay your taxes.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.980]   And my response to that is,
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.240]   if you think about the wealthiest people in this country
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.740]   and like who pays their fair share,
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.860]   there's a percentage of people that can afford
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.800]   the most expensive lawyers and accountants
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.740]   and all these people to figure it out for them.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.620]   And our goal is like,
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.460]   can we just democratize this information
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.900]   and give it to everyone?
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.680]   And then you decide what you want to do with that.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.520]   That's one group.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.940]   The other group wants to straight up tax fraud.
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.300]   They come up with the most like crazy schemes.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.980]   They're like, yeah, but how will the IRS know?
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.420]   And we're like, the goal is not to be fraudulent.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.500]   It's like, let us give you all the information
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.060]   and the knowledge 'cause the tax code is so complicated.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.360]   And then you decide what you want to do with that.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.640]   - And just to be clear, it's probably worth clarifying,
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.560]   neither of us are CPAs.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.360]   This is not tax advice or investment advice
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.840]   or anything of the sort.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.240]   - This is for informational and educational purposes only.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.520]   This is not tax advice, legal advice, investment advice.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.720]   You know the drill.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.960]   - And I think one of the interesting things that I said,
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.840]   I did an episode last year about kind of money moves
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.360]   to make at the end of the year.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.400]   I'll defer people to there if they want to go beyond taxes.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.720]   There's some other stuff there.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.340]   I went down a few more rabbit holes.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.200]   But one of the frameworks that I really liked was
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.880]   whenever we think about taxes,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.920]   the goal is first try to avoid it,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.240]   then try to defer it.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.240]   And kind of then later in some future year,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.280]   repeat this in case the tax code changes.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.500]   And if you can't do either, try to minimize it.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.340]   I think we're gonna hit on all three of those.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.000]   Are there any other starting points
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.040]   that you want people listening
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.100]   to just kind of have some broad context
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.440]   when it comes to thinking about taxes?
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.000]   - Yeah, so a few like concepts to ground in
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.040]   that I think are really important.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.720]   One is, I think people should know
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.340]   what their effective tax rate is,
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.960]   which roughly is just like how much you pay in taxes
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.280]   divided by your income.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.260]   In itself, it's not that useful a number,
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.520]   but it's good to see for people in similar income brackets
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.240]   what that number is and how to reduce that.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.160]   The other thing to touch on,
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.040]   'cause you just said the best thing is to like avoid it,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.960]   or if not that, defer it.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.600]   In some rare cases,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.080]   I do think it makes sense to front load it.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.600]   And the reason for that is,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.960]   I also think it's important to think about
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.160]   your lifetime tax rate.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.520]   Like sometimes there will be cases
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.040]   where it makes sense to pay slightly more in taxes now
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.000]   to pay substantially less later.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.840]   And a good example is like Roth accounts, right?
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.160]   Sometimes it can make a lot of sense
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.880]   to take a little bit of tax now,
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.680]   let that money grow and compound,
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.180]   but then over your lifetime,
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.440]   you're paying substantially less in taxes.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.480]   I think those are important concepts.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.120]   Also love telling people like,
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.740]   don't get too carried away with this.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.640]   Like taxes are a part of life.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.680]   I mean, the expression that people refer to
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.000]   is don't let the tax tail wag the dog.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.320]   As an example is,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.600]   your business can make no money and you'll have no taxes,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.520]   but you know, that's besides the point.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.900]   At the end of the day, like, you know,
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.880]   you don't want to live somewhere
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.440]   just to save money on taxes.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.760]   Like you live the life you want
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.600]   and you know, figure out your tax strategy
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.080]   in response to that.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.920]   - Two other things.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.440]   One, on that point, I did meet someone
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.040]   and I kind of want to do a deeper dive on this.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   We're not going to go into it,
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.960]   but someone who basically ran their business
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.640]   to the point that it made no money
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.640]   and they were doing reselling and all this stuff.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.480]   And so by lowering their margins,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.800]   they had the best prices, volume went up
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.280]   and they were doing,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.880]   I want to say more than $10 million a year of sales
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.400]   on a business that net income went to zero.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.920]   But they were putting $10 million on a credit card.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.200]   So all of the points in cash back
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.280]   created tax-free income.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.060]   And by their math,
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.760]   they would have made less money
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.480]   by raising the margins and making more
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.660]   because they would have had income,
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.840]   but it would have been all taxable.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.780]   So they like played the volume game
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.480]   and won on cash back.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.040]   - I would love to see the analysis there.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.000]   'Cause I mean, with tax back, you get what, like 2%?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.960]   It's very, very hard for me to see
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.280]   how that is the best outcome.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.760]   But again, I still think, yeah,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.600]   don't let the tax tail wag the dog.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.840]   Live the life you want
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.880]   and then figure out your tax strategy in response to that.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.600]   - And you've talked about return on hassle before.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.480]   So like some things in tax planning
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.000]   and tax optimization can be a lot of work.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.020]   And if it's really just going to save you a few hundred dollars
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.920]   make sure you know what you're getting into.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.080]   - Yeah, like again, like I know some people
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.480]   who are, you know, want to make sure
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.960]   that they don't miss a single $14 expense
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.800]   or whatever.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.280]   And again, I think if you're organized
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.720]   it's worth keeping track of all of that,
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.280]   but it's better to focus your energy on the few things
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.840]   that make a really big difference
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.600]   versus trying to do every single thing
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.080]   and burning yourself out.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.460]   - Okay, so the way I think we're going to break this down,
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.520]   we'll start with all kinds of things
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.060]   that apply to a broad audience.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.640]   People who have general W-2 income,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.280]   things that apply to people in every circumstance.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.240]   We'll move in not to retirement and tax advantage
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.000]   at accounts, which I know you've talked a lot about
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.600]   because if you go back a couple of weeks,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.560]   I did an entire episode with Katie from Money With Katie.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   We went through every single element
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.760]   of tax advantage accounts.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.480]   So we're actually going to skip over that
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.200]   and jump into investments.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   And there's a lot of ways that you can use
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   the style of investing and the way you take capital gains
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.340]   and roll them over to be efficient with taxes.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.600]   And then we'll end talking about things
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.360]   that apply to business owners,
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.080]   including ways that someone who might not be
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.080]   a business owner yet might want us to think about it.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.120]   I think that's a good plan.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.500]   So if we start with regular people,
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.920]   I think one thing that it's important
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.040]   to help people understand is not all income
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.280]   is taxed the same way.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.560]   And so let's talk about capital gains
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.680]   'cause it's a totally different type of income.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.480]   But one other common thing that I just thought of
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.280]   that I often realize some people don't quite understand
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.600]   is marginal versus effective tax rates.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.280]   So I hear some people say, I'm in the 39% tax bracket,
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.160]   I'm at the top.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.480]   The way the tax code works for anyone not familiar
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.880]   is that it's progressive.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.640]   So the first tranche of your income
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.000]   is at the lowest tax rate,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.160]   and then it goes up and up and up,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.680]   at least with income tax.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.560]   Capital gains tax, similar,
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.540]   but it actually pushes you into a new bucket for everything.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.800]   So just to be clear,
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.200]   your effective tax rate could be 28%,
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.020]   but your marginal tax rate could be 33% or more.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.800]   And if you're in that circumstance,
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.760]   that actually means that the amount of money you'll save
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.280]   by reducing your taxable income
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.080]   is higher than what your effective tax rate is.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.220]   And so it can be really valuable.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.660]   But a common misconception with some people
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.500]   is if you're in the 39% tax bracket,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.620]   and you reduce your income
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.820]   to be in the next lower tax bracket,
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.400]   it doesn't affect all your income.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.900]   It only affects that marginal amount of your income.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.900]   - Yep, that's a really good point.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.260]   Yeah, there's so many people who are like,
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.580]   oh, let me go $1 under a certain bracket
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.900]   because it affects all my income.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.300]   But no, it's only income above that threshold
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.380]   that gets taxed at the higher rate.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.120]   - Okay, so let's talk about capital gains.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.260]   - All right, so again,
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.380]   I think the way to think about this is,
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.340]   I said I was actually an economics major in college.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.720]   So we actually remember learning this quite a while back,
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.340]   but like basic economics,
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.060]   ultimately people make income either through their labor,
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.700]   which is your salary or whatever,
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.860]   or through capital, which is when you invest in something
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.580]   and that asset grows in value.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.780]   Don't ask me why.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.660]   A lot of people can argue that, you know,
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.540]   labor should be taxed at a lower rate,
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.900]   capital should be taxed at a higher rate,
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.020]   but the way it works in America and most other countries
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.740]   is capital gains are not only taxed at a lower rate,
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.700]   there's just a lot more strategies you have
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.220]   to either defer or negate capital gains taxes.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.660]   So as an example,
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.660]   the highest tier for long-term capital gains,
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.500]   which is when you hold an investment, a security,
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.860]   anything for over a year, is 20%,
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.380]   as opposed to the highest rate on your income is,
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.620]   I don't know, 35%, a little bit more than that.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.820]   So in general, capital gains when held for a year
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.060]   are much more efficient,
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.140]   but you can also offset them with other capital losses
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.260]   to create this idea of no net capital gain,
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.180]   which reduces the amount of taxes.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.020]   - So I think for people listening,
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.100]   it's important to know that not all types of income
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.340]   are taxed the same.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.340]   So capital gains, obviously lower.
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.060]   At a certain level of income, I don't know the threshold,
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.620]   there's no capital gains tax.
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.100]   It's like, it's under $100,000 and under,
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.940]   then it goes to 15 and then 20.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.300]   And then at the highest end,
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.300]   there's this net investment income tax,
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.540]   which adds on a few more percent after that.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.700]   - Yeah, the other thing worth noting
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.380]   with capital gains taxes is like these preferential rates
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.500]   only apply when you hold onto a capital
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.940]   for any investment for over a year.
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.540]   If you're under a year,
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.460]   it counts as short-term capital gains,
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.580]   which is typically taxed at the ordinary income rate.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.100]   But if you have short-term capital gains,
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.500]   you can still use other capital losses
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.020]   to try and offset them.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.340]   So what I tell a lot of people
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.500]   is try and avoid short-term capital gains,
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.060]   because it means you could either find ways
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.300]   of canceling them out with losses
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.620]   or potentially holding the investment a little bit longer.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.140]   But the fact that short-term capital gains
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.500]   are taxed the same as income means they're quite inefficient.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.380]   And if possible, you wanna try and avoid paying that.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.420]   - Obviously, you don't wanna necessarily hold onto an asset
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.060]   for an extra seven months that you don't feel great about.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.540]   But if you were at 360 days
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.660]   and you could hold it for five more days,
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.500]   the benefit there is gonna be really high.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.100]   But when it comes to the end of the year,
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.180]   I think one important thing to cover is tax-loss harvesting.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.140]   Like you said, if you have capital losses,
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.860]   they can offset capital gains.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.980]   And if you have $3,000 of capital losses,
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.700]   you can even offset your regular W-2 employment income.
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.380]   So towards the end of the year,
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.580]   if you're not already using some robo-investing platform
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.900]   that will automate this,
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.980]   I feel like it's something everyone should be doing.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.460]   - Yep, so here's what I'd normally do.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.860]   I'm not gonna do it this year
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.620]   because I had enough in losses last year
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.860]   that I'm not worried about paying capital gains taxes
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.700]   this year.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.540]   But what I would normally do
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.180]   is at the start of December every year,
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.260]   I would open my brokerage accounts, wherever they are,
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.580]   and I would basically try and see
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.060]   what my net capital gain or loss is for the year.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.100]   And if it makes sense, try and make the numbers line up.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.900]   Again, we don't wanna do irrational things.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.940]   Don't let the tax tail wag the dog.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.580]   But if you're gonna be at a point
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.980]   where you're paying a little bit in capital gains,
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.020]   but there's a losing position
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.380]   you would otherwise wanna take,
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.220]   it may make sense to do that.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.420]   This was a hard lesson for me a year or two ago
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.500]   when I was using Robinhood as my primary brokerage
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.660]   and realized it's actually not very well suited
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.740]   to doing any of this
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.020]   'cause you can't analyze specific tax slots,
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.460]   you can't sell specific tax slots,
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.620]   you couldn't even see your net capital gain or loss,
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.140]   but any of the adult grownup brokerages
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.180]   will let you do that.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.340]   And it's a worthy exercise to figure out
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.700]   what capital gains taxes you will have.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.820]   If you're in a position like me
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.620]   where I had so much in capital losses last year
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.060]   'cause it was a brutal year,
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.300]   you can actually carry forward those indefinitely.
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.740]   So my gains this year will be offset
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.860]   with the carry forward capital losses from last year,
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.300]   but it's a worthy exercise doing otherwise.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.140]   - So that's one thing is
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.060]   just understand everything's different.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.580]   It seems like every week,
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.660]   there's a new data breach to expose your personal info,
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.620]   like how in November,
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.980]   pretty much the entire population of Maine
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.780]   had their personal info exposed.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.740]   And once your info ends up in one place,
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.060]   it's like plain whack-a-mole to get it taken down
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.860]   from all the other data brokers.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.420]   Fortunately, you can get them to remove your info,
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.300]   but unfortunately, that process can take hours
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.340]   to do yourself.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.100]   I know because I tried to do it,
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.020]   and after spending over 10 hours,
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.500]   I gave up and started using Delete.me, our sponsor today.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.580]   Delete.me is an amazing service I've been using for years
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.420]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.540]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.580]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.300]   and get that removed as well,
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.220]   which really matters because in my last report,
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.060]   I saw my personal info show up
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.660]   and subsequently get removed
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.500]   from another 61 data broker sites.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.380]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes over 2,000 pieces
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.460]   of personal data for a customer in their first two years,
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.900]   and to date, they've removed over 100 million pieces of data
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.020]   for their customers.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.900]   So if you wanna get your personal info removed from the web,
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.100]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.100]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.460]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.420]   There's a time in every business
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.380]   when that problem you've been ignoring needs to be handled.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.500]   If you're getting frustrated
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.740]   with how you're selling online or in person,
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.340]   I can't recommend Shopify highly enough,
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.100]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.120]   for this episode.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.540]   Shopify is the commerce platform
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.540]   revolutionizing millions of businesses worldwide.

[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.060]   and grow your business without the struggle.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.300]   What I love about Shopify
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.420]   is how no matter how big you wanna grow,
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.180]   Shopify gives you everything you need to take control

[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.840]   or selling your custom travel guides
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.540]   on Shopify's all-in-one e-commerce platform,
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.740]   you are covered.

[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.100]   Let's talk about some of the ways
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.900]   that people can start to chip away at their income,
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.140]   'cause ultimately the way the tax code works
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.340]   and your filing is you have your income,
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.980]   then you have a bunch of things you subtract
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.220]   and adjust it with.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.500]   And then that final amount is your adjusted income,
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.700]   AGI, adjusted gross income,
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.500]   and that's what you pay taxes on.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.220]   So one of those things is itemizing your deductions.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.460]   Let's talk a little bit about
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.380]   how you can kind of optimize this and whether you should.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.980]   - So in general, the government kind of gives us a choice.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.220]   We can either just take their deduction
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.460]   called a standard deduction and apply it.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.740]   And I think that is 27,000 roughly if you're married,
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.180]   about half that if you're single.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.180]   And funnily enough, I think something like 85 to 90%
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.340]   of people just take the standard deduction.
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.020]   If you don't, if you choose to take itemized deductions,
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.260]   which is you turn down the standard deduction,
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.580]   you can take deductions for a lot of other things.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.900]   A big one that we'll talk a lot about
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.620]   is charitable contributions,
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.740]   which you can't deduct
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.220]   unless you're choosing to take itemized deductions.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.300]   But aside from that, things like student loan interest,
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.820]   mortgage interest, large medical expenses
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.580]   that I think are more than 7.5% of income,
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.060]   some random stuff like the cost of doing your taxes.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.900]   I was actually amused to find out
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.580]   you can deduct gambling losses
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.220]   if you itemize your deductions.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.700]   But there's a bunch of good stuff there.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.420]   Oh, state and local taxes is a big one,
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.100]   even though that's limited to $10,000
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.260]   unless you're a business owner.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.500]   But I tend to think if you either are charitably minded
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.420]   or your taxes are somewhat complicated,
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.420]   itemized deductions usually work out to be a better deal.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.820]   But for everyone else, you can just take an automatic,
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.620]   you know, standard $27,000 deduction.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.300]   Mortgage interest being one of the ones
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.740]   that often is the biggest.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.220]   But you mentioned state and local taxes,
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.500]   which I can't remember what year it was at this point,
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.140]   but a handful of years ago got limited.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.540]   2017, so what happened in 2017
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.180]   is you had the Trump Jobs Act,
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.540]   which basically, it kind of reiterated
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.060]   the way the American tax code works.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.420]   And the way the American tax code works
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.180]   is it benefits two groups of people above everyone else,
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.140]   business owners and real estate developers.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.500]   And if you're a real estate business owner, even more so.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.620]   And it gave a bunch of benefits to business owners,
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.180]   but to make the math work out,
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.620]   it created legislation to cap state and local taxes,
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.700]   the amount that could be deducted
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.340]   from your federal return to $10,000.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.380]   What's worse is if you're married,
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.020]   the limit is still $10,000.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.300]   So it's actually worse if you're married
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.540]   because you don't get like a collectively higher number
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.500]   with the idea of being this hurts states
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.020]   with higher state taxes,
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.780]   which typically tend to be Democrat states.
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.140]   But either way, we'll talk about that more
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.540]   in the business owner section,
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.500]   because as a business owner,
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.260]   you can actually work around it.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.100]   But for everyone else,
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.060]   if you live in California and pay 100,000 in state taxes,
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.140]   you can only deduct $10,000 from your federal return,
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.340]   which is a bummer.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.180]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.140]   And one strategy I've heard,
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.420]   we'll talk about charitable donations
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.740]   and way to optimize that,
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.660]   but you don't have to make this decision forever.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.540]   So I know some people who choose
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.660]   to make all their charitable contributions
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.060]   in alternating years,
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.300]   pay a few extra mortgage payments in alternating years
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.220]   so that in one year, they can deduct as much as possible.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.580]   And then in the next year,
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.140]   they can go back to the standard deduction.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.140]   So I think thinking about if you're on the cusp
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.220]   and you're looking at all your itemized deductions
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.380]   and you're like, wow, you're kind of near 27,
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.740]   then it might be wise to have a strategy
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.260]   of putting everything in odd years or even years
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.300]   and then swapping each year.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.140]   - Yep, absolutely.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.740]   It's on a year by year basis.
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.500]   So you can always sort of change.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.540]   My guess is more people will start itemizing deductions
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.780]   slowly as interest rates go up, mortgage rate,
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.620]   mortgage interest.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.220]   I think part of the reason
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.860]   standard deductions made sense for a lot of people
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.260]   is mortgage interests were so low for so long.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.620]   And as that climbs up,
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.860]   I think more people will end up itemizing.
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.180]   - Okay, that's itemizing standard.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.340]   One of those big ones you mentioned
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.820]   is charitable deductions.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.060]   We did talk about donor advised funds in general
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.380]   in the tax advantaged accounts,
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.420]   but let's talk more broadly about charitable donations
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.540]   and how powerful that deduction is.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.300]   - Yeah, I think it's one of the few things
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.700]   that you have the opportunity to do good in this world
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.020]   and get rewarded for it, right?
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.060]   Like I think the government is quite generous
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.260]   because a dollar donated to charity
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.460]   reduces your taxable income by a dollar.
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.740]   Super fair, very generous,
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.540]   and can be used to offset a lot of income.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.340]   One of the things to note is if you donate cash,
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.500]   you can offset up to 60% of your income.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.500]   If you donate appreciated assets,
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.060]   you can only offset 30% of your income.
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.300]   A lot of people read that and are like,
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.860]   "Oh wow, I should donate a lot of cash."
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.820]   But funnily enough, it's actually much more efficient
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.780]   to donate appreciated assets
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.620]   because you're getting a double tax break in a way
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.140]   because you're getting the deduction for donating the asset,
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.260]   but you're also getting the benefit
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.660]   of what would have been the gain you would pay
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.340]   if you sold that asset and donated cash.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.500]   So if you donate appreciated shares, for instance,
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.100]   you get the tax deduction for the entire amount.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.940]   But if you sell those shares,
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.300]   you'd have to pay taxes on that
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.460]   and only donate the net of tax amount.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.580]   So donating appreciated assets, in my opinion,
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.700]   is something that is almost always better
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.180]   than donating cash.
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.220]   And you can donate all sorts of assets.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.180]   I mean, public equities are a very common one,
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.340]   but based on how fancy you want to get,
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.020]   I know people who will donate art to a museum
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.860]   where they'll try and buy art very cheaply.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.620]   And if they have a good eye,
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:52.980]   have it independently appraised,
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.300]   it's now worth 10 times more
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.860]   and they get a 10 times larger deduction.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.460]   One other interesting thing is,
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.740]   I would maybe say you could extend this to everyone
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.540]   if you factor in the fact that there's no wash sale rule
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.940]   on charitable donations.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.380]   And so if you're thinking,
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.740]   "I want to make a $500 donation to a charity,"
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.460]   if you hold any stock worth $500
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.020]   that you bought for less than $500,
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.900]   forgetting the return on hassle here,
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.180]   'cause maybe at $500, it's not worth it,
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.980]   but donating that stock is going to save you capital gains
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.060]   and you will not save it if you donate cash.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.260]   - Oh, that's actually fascinating.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.900]   I never thought about that.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.140]   - So if you wanted to do that,
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.500]   you could use that $500
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.460]   to immediately just rebuy whatever you donated
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.260]   and step up your cost basis.
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.460]   - Yeah, for free.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.860]   - For free, exactly.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.300]   Maybe the only argument against this
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.940]   is if you're very, very old
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.540]   and you're planning on passing these assets down,
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.500]   one other great thing about the tax code
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.380]   is that you get a step up in your cost basis
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.660]   when you pass stocks down to your children
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.580]   so that capital gains tax ends up being zero.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.500]   So maybe in that rare case,
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.300]   you could argue that it's equal, but yeah.
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.740]   And another way to avoid a lot of the hassle here,
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.940]   which I've heard you talk about,
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.460]   is with donor-advised funds.
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.060]   And we talked in this example about $500.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.620]   It would be a pain for every $100, $200, $300 donation
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.500]   you wanna make to call the charity
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.500]   and coordinate a stock transfer
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.140]   and work with your brokerage firm.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.580]   So in general, I think donating,
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.220]   you can open up a donor-advised fund,
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.980]   which we talked about a couple of weeks ago,
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.620]   and donate all of those securities once.
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.260]   And this really helps with that alternating strategy, right?
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.380]   You could make your donation
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.500]   and then have a pool of funds
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.180]   that you could both invest so it grows,
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.780]   but then donate from whenever.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.500]   And you can kind of separate the donating from the giving.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.580]   - Yeah, super useful, right?
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.780]   Like again, let's say there's a year
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.260]   you wanna take itemized deductions in,
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.460]   you can front load your entire donation.
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.140]   You can basically do the tax planning part of it
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.660]   in isolation from the giving part of it.
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.460]   And the fact that once money's in a donor-advised fund,
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.780]   it's invested and is growing
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.300]   also means like charity will get more money in the future.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.220]   So it's not like you're taking money away from charity.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.020]   You're putting money into this pool of funds
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.140]   that you're marked for charity.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.780]   It can be invested, it can grow,
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.140]   and then you can give it whenever is appropriate.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.900]   - If some charities don't accept stocks
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.820]   or don't accept crypto or have high minimums,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.340]   this kind of avoids that.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.940]   I think anyone who's listened to this show for a while
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.700]   knows that we partner with Daffy.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:15.900]   It's a donor-advised fund.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.140]   It's the one I use.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.380]   I think of the options that the average person
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.180]   can just sign up for personally,
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.700]   I like it the most if you're an average consumer.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.140]   And so you can go to allthehacks.com/daffy
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.060]   and get a free $25 if you want.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.900]   - Sweet.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.380]   I mean, in general, charitable donations
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.540]   is something that I think makes a ton of sense,
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.940]   again, just 'cause it has a benefit
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.100]   of doing good in the world while also helping in taxes.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.980]   - And it doesn't have to be money or stock or crypto.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.380]   You can donate up to, I think, $5,000 of items
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.500]   absent kind of appraisals and anything.
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.460]   - Clothes, electronics, like all kinds of things.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.300]   - There are a lot of different ways
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.020]   you can choose to value them, but that's up to you.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.980]   But definitely something if you're thinking
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.100]   at the end of the year,
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.300]   I have a bunch of stuff in my house to get rid of,
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.940]   great time to go donate it
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.580]   if you'll be itemizing this year.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.660]   And again, falls in line with that alternating strategy of,
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.420]   okay, this is the year we're gonna donate everything
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.060]   in our donor-advised fund, give everything away,
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.860]   make some extra mortgage payments,
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.540]   and then next year we'll donate from our DAF the whole year.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.500]   Cool, so that is charitable donations.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.660]   There's a couple other things I'll touch on on energy.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.140]   Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act,
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.860]   which we'll get to a bit more when we talk about solar,
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.180]   they increased the cap for lifetime cap
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.540]   on energy efficient improvements to your home.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.780]   So things like heat pumps
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.980]   and upgrading windows or insulation and furnaces,
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.180]   I think it's a $1,200 limit now.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.220]   So if there's any changes you make there,
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.180]   definitely look into it
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.780]   'cause there's a bunch of stipulations on different items
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.900]   and how much you can get, but that's one.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.980]   Also in energy, solar at your home.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.660]   So when you install solar stuff,
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.500]   any company that's selling you solar knows this.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.660]   And so I'm not gonna try to go through the details,
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.900]   but if you go to any website to buy solar anything,
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.220]   whether it's a Tesla Powerwall or solar roof
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.780]   or anything from another local vendor, there's that.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.140]   And then also the EV tax credit, you get $7,500,
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.820]   but there is a salary cap to that tax credit.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.140]   - Is December 31st a deadline for all of this,
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:11.980]   for anyone listening?
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.820]   - I believe all of the energy efficiency improvements
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.740]   apply based on a calendar basis.
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.420]   But a lot of the Inflation Reduction Act benefits
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.060]   were through 2033, I believe.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.580]   And so some of these things,
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.420]   it's not a take it or leave it, right?
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.060]   If you don't get your energy efficient stuff done this year,
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.460]   you can aim for it next year.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.420]   And I think that's gonna be a theme throughout this episode.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.300]   There's a lot of ways that you can limit your taxes
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.100]   and we're recording this at the end of November.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.860]   That doesn't mean that, you know,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.620]   you're gonna be able to do all of them this year,
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.900]   but this is a long game.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:42.980]   - Yep, absolutely.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.380]   But for a lot of it, December 31st is a very important date.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.100]   So the things that can be implemented quickly,
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.780]   it's totally worth looking into.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.020]   - Yeah, the charitable donations,
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.300]   I can't remember the percent,
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.700]   but like the highest percent of charitable donations,
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.660]   I think on a given day in the year is December 31st.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.900]   And I was talking to one of the people on the Daffy team
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.940]   and they said like up until 1157,
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.340]   people were donating crypto
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.380]   because it's like an instant donation
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.820]   or people were donating, you know,
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.860]   for their donor advised fund
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.740]   and putting on a credit card like right before midnight.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.660]   So that's one of the few ways to reduce your taxable income.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.700]   But just to be clear, you are donating money.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.860]   Like it's not a give $1,000 and somehow make back 1200,
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.460]   it's give 1,000, create a lot of impact
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.860]   for other organizations and get back a few hundred.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.180]   But for those of us who are charitably inclined,
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.420]   it's definitely a win for both sides.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.740]   - If there's time at the end of the episode,
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.460]   we can talk a little bit about charitable remainder trust.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.620]   Those are weird instruments,
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.180]   but those can sometimes,
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.060]   for people who have very large capital gains,
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.620]   literally be like you give money to charity,
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.780]   but also end up with more money yourself.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.620]   I did an episode,
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.580]   I think you've done an interview with Manny from Valor also,
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.940]   and he and I did a whole episode
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.020]   and we went through all these charitable remainder trusts
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.380]   and grants and all this stuff.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.180]   We'll touch on it at a high level too.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.940]   On kids, is there anything other than 529s
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.460]   for people with parents to be thinking about?
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.540]   - One of the strategies that I think could make sense,
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.540]   and maybe this is more of a business owner thing,
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.980]   is I've seen a lot of business owners
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.780]   hire their children for, again, legitimate jobs, right?
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.340]   Like this, you don't wanna have tax fraud,
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.940]   but you have a 13, 14, 15 year old
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.500]   helping you with social media.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.660]   You can hire them, pay them,
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.780]   and outside of having them get some income
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.380]   and if they're under the standard deduction,
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.540]   being able to keep that income,
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.940]   what is also cool is it makes them eligible
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.300]   to start a Roth IRA.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.020]   'Cause for a Roth IRA, you have to have earned income.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.900]   So if you are able to have children pretty young,
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.940]   13, 14, 15, start a Roth IRA,
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.500]   it starts a compounding a lot earlier.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.300]   So I think that's something kind of cool
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.700]   that could make sense for people that are business owners
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.940]   and wanna have their children involved in the business.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.780]   - And even if you don't,
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.420]   if you have a 13 or 14 year old child,
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.540]   you could encourage them to get a job
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.660]   and put that money away in a Roth IRA.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.900]   If you wanted to encourage that savings,
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.220]   they could get a job, put it in their Roth IRA,
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.020]   and you could gift them some spending money.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.340]   So like a way to backdoor into your kid's Roth IRA
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.380]   would be to make them get a job, invest the money,
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.860]   and then kind of replace their money
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.620]   that they probably as a 13 year old
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.220]   would rather keep and spend.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.380]   - And you look at the math, right?
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.980]   Putting dollars into a Roth at 13 versus 25, 27,
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.580]   the amount of compounds, it's totally different.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.660]   - I'm already, with a one and a three year old,
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.500]   we're already like,
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.020]   how do we try to max this Roth out as quickly as possible?
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.580]   So definitely thinking about that.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.100]   There's a bunch of other tax advantage to count stuff
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.940]   that you can do before the end of the year.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.300]   If you haven't put money in a Roth IRA
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.700]   or done a backdoor Roth or contributed your 401k,
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.020]   I guess in that case,
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.500]   you probably only have whatever comes
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.180]   in your 1231 paycheck.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.740]   - HSAs, FSAs.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.140]   - But like I said, we've covered a lot of those.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.340]   The one thing I will flag that I've heard you say
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.180]   that I didn't realize, also on the note of kids,
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.180]   is that 529s don't necessarily have
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.940]   the most tax savings benefits in the year you contribute,
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.980]   though some states do have some perks to donating.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.580]   California is not one.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.620]   I didn't realize that it matters which state you pick
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.220]   for how you use your funds.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.060]   - It absolutely does.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.420]   Like different states have different rules.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.020]   What that means is different states have different rules
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.220]   on what you can spend money on,
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.500]   different states have different investment options,
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.740]   and you absolutely are under no obligation
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.820]   to pick the 529 from your state.
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.700]   If your state gives you a tax benefit, you probably should,
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.660]   but for everyone else,
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.260]   just go pick a state with the best plan.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.260]   I've heard some people do Utah, Nevada.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.380]   Those are generally good ones.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.020]   Do some research and pick the best state
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.580]   if you're not getting a tax break.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.820]   - And 'cause I've heard they passed IRS legislation,
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.620]   I believe that, and maybe it wasn't even the IRS,
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:37.980]   but that you can use your 529 for K-12 education,
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.460]   but not in every state.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.420]   And so the good news is I believe
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.380]   that if you have a 529 in a state that wouldn't let you,
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.860]   I believe you can transfer and roll it
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.780]   into a 529 in a state that would.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.060]   So you're not really restricted that much.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.220]   And if you're in a tax break state that doesn't allow it,
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.380]   well, donate or contribute, get the tax break,
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.660]   and then later, if you need it for K-12 education
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.220]   and your plan doesn't allow it, move it to another state.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.460]   - Another thing I never realized until quite recently
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.220]   is if you're in a state that gives you a tax break
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.380]   for donating to 529, you could literally do it right away.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.820]   If you're paying for college tomorrow,
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.100]   you could put money into the 529 right now
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.020]   and pay it out immediately just to get the tax break.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.380]   There's no sort of minimum holding period or anything.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.540]   - I believe you can also do the same with an HSA.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.380]   Not that we talked about all the amazing tax benefits
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.260]   of an HSA and you should probably hold onto it forever,
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.180]   but if you don't have the funds to invest in an HSA,
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.100]   but you're eligible and you have medical expenses,
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.180]   you might as well just put the money in the HSA
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.860]   and take it out the next day
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.460]   if the alternative is not putting it in at all.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.940]   - Yep, makes a ton of sense.
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:45.060]   - You all already heard me talk about our sponsor,
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.420]   Daffy, in this episode.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.740]   And if you've listened for a while,
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.820]   then you know I'm a huge fan of them and their mission
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.580]   to help people be more generous more often,
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.380]   especially during the end of the year
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.500]   when I'm trying to make sure
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.260]   I dial in all my tax optimizations.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.380]   I'm such a huge fan of Daffy and I've used it for years,
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.140]   but if you're not familiar, it's a platform and app
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.340]   that helps regular folks like you and me
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.180]   manage giving to the charities we care about more efficiently
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.100]   and they do that by helping you set up
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.340]   a special tax advantaged account
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.860]   called a donor advised fund or DAF.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.700]   Daffy is the lowest cost DAF provider around
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.500]   and whether you're giving a few hundred dollars to charity
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.100]   or hundreds of thousands,
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.740]   they make it possible to give and grow your donations
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.620]   via a simple mobile app.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.520]   It's so convenient because you get all your giving records
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.460]   and donation receipts organized in one single place
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.860]   and every donation to your DAF is a tax deduction,
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.340]   whether it's cash, stock or crypto.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.820]   Though, as I said before, it probably shouldn't be cash.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.860]   So if you want a better system for giving,
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.060]   head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.860]   and for a limited time at that link,
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.620]   you can get a free $25 to give to the charity of your choice
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:59.620]   which again is allthehacks.com/daffy, D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.760]   (air whooshing)
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.160]   I got so fed up with ridiculously expensive razor blades
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.960]   that I had to search for a better option
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.600]   and I not only ended up saving a ton of money,
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.000]   but I'm now getting an even better shave
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.200]   which is why you've gotta check out Henson Shaving
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.640]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.540]   First off, Henson Shaving is an aerospace parts manufacturer
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.760]   that decided to bring their precision engineering
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.920]   to a razor.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.960]   Why does that matter?
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.360]   Well, it turns out razor blades
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.240]   are kind of like diving boards.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.540]   The longer the board, the more wobble
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.540]   which leads to nicks and cuts.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.620]   So a bad shave isn't actually a blade problem,
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.300]   it's an extension problem.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.580]   And by using aerospace grade machines,
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.980]   Henson makes metal razors that extend out
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:46.980]   just 0.0013 inches, less than the thickness of a human hair,
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.460]   which means a secure and stable blade
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.740]   with the vibration free shave.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.340]   I actually spent the first few weeks
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.860]   using my Henson razor on one half of my face
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.820]   and my old overpriced cartridge razor
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.500]   on the other, so I can very confidently say
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.060]   it's a much better shave.
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.660]   And the best thing, once you own a Henson razor,
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.260]   it's only about $3 to $5 a year
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.520]   to replace the standard dual edged blades.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.540]   It's time to say no to subscriptions
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:15.620]   and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.420]   Visit allthehacks.com/henson to pick the razor for you
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.860]   and use code ALLTHEHACKS to get two years worth of blades
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.500]   free with your razor.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.500]   Just make sure to add them to your cart.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.740]   That's 100 free blades when you head
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:33.740]   to allthehacks.com/henson and use code ALLTHEHACKS.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:38.900]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.380]   and supporting the show.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:43.220]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:46.740]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals and discounts
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:51.220]   from our partners, you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.620]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.060]   - One thing that I know you talk about
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:00.020]   for kind of W-2 employees is non-qualified
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.180]   deferred comp plans.
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.140]   - And QDCs.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.220]   - And it's something I tried at Google and worked out,
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.660]   but can you talk a little bit more about this?
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.480]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.040]   So in my opinion, the people that pay the most in taxes
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.900]   are like truly high W-2 earners.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.500]   Like people earning high hundreds of thousands
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.540]   or even more in W-2, they're basically got
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:22.220]   the highest effective tax rate of anyone right there.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.180]   There's billionaires that have a lower effective tax rate
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.820]   than someone making $500,000 in their job.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.180]   So what if that is you?
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.780]   What if you're again, net in a very privileged position,
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.940]   you have a great life, you're earning five, six,
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:37.380]   $700,000 in salary, what do you do then?
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.300]   Chances are, if you live in California, New York,
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.660]   you're paying almost half of it in taxes.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.140]   So you're probably looking for alternatives.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.260]   One of the alternatives you can do is something called
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.820]   a non-qualified deferred compensation plan
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.780]   or an NQDC for short, 'cause it's a bit of a mouthful.
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.500]   What that does is it lets you bifurcate your income
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.420]   into money you receive today
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.660]   and money you put away for the future.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.540]   And the money you defer to the future,
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.740]   the entire pre-tax amount gets invested
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.100]   and you then get paid out that money at a later point,
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.500]   potentially in retirement when you may be
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.420]   in a lower tax bracket or something.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.980]   And this has two big benefits.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:17.000]   One, in the years where your marginal tax rate is higher,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.260]   that income is not taxed that higher marginal tax rate,
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:22.100]   it moves to a future year where you may have
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.540]   a lower tax rate.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.980]   The other benefit is the entire pre-tax amount
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.060]   gets invested.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:31.220]   So compounding starts working on a larger base,
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.240]   potentially leaving you with more money
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.360]   when it's time to pay you out.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.700]   Both of these sound great.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.900]   Also, what's great is they're not subject
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.260]   to discrimination testing the way, you know,
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.380]   like 401k plans and stuff are very limited
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.220]   because they can't treat different employees differently.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.060]   But an NQDC can be set up on a per employee basis.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.500]   So a lot of people can talk to their company about it.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.620]   The one downside to bring up is the NQ part.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.180]   Like, why is it called non-qualified?
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.500]   What does that mean?
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.580]   What it means is in case the company is going bankrupt
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.980]   or creditors are coming after the assets,
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.820]   your plan is not safe, which is very different
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.900]   from a 401k or stuff where your plan assets are protected.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:16.260]   So my advice would be, if you are considering an NQDC,
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.340]   think about who your employer is.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.500]   Like getting an NQDC from Microsoft, I'd feel pretty good.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.980]   Getting an NQDC from like a six person company
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.000]   that may not be around in 10 years, I probably wouldn't.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.020]   But definitely worth considering
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.340]   if you're a truly high W-2 earner.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.660]   - When I was at Google, I did this.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.620]   And one of the things they made very clear,
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.500]   and maybe this is plan dependent,
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.580]   is like, if you change your mind next year
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.520]   and want the money, like they had a minimum.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.760]   It was like three years or I think it was like six months
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.940]   if you leave the company.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.420]   So like, this is money you aren't going
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.300]   to likely have access to, so keep that in mind.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.340]   But in my case, while I was at Google,
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.460]   I had a much higher salary than when I started as a company.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.060]   And so I actually deferred a bunch of my income
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.960]   and then I quit Google.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.820]   My salary dropped to like $30,000 a year.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.260]   And like six months later, I got all of this money
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.980]   that I had earned three years before and it was great.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.060]   And at Google, I trusted that they weren't gonna go bankrupt
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.100]   in three years, so great option.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:13.940]   So that's a really interesting-
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.020]   - After a high W-2, very often you can negotiate this
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.860]   and a lot of companies, especially big tech employers,
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.220]   do these quite often.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.660]   - Is it a lot of administrative work
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.180]   for the company to do this?
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.060]   - Yeah, but anyone that's like a Fortune 500 type company
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.820]   that has tons of people, they all do it
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.100]   'cause it's kind of a big win
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.660]   and it helps them from a recruiting perspective.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.940]   - Any other big things outside of investments,
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.940]   real estate and all that, that we'll get to next
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.180]   that W-2 employees should be thinking about?
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.020]   - We'll come to a lot of it in the business owner section,
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.380]   but I've also seen people in some cases
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.460]   who have a high W-2 getting the company to bifurcate it
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.060]   and also hire them as a consultant.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.140]   So they are both a W-2 employee
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.140]   and provide consulting services
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.860]   and they can do a lot more planning with the consulting side.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.400]   Again, it doesn't work always.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.020]   - If you're making 250,000 and your employer can pay you 150
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.660]   and then give you 100,000 as a consulting job,
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.280]   it's actually probably gonna save them money
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.140]   in terms of employment taxes.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.900]   So it could be pitched as a benefit to them.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.260]   And then, the last part of this conversation
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.340]   is gonna be all about saving money as a business owner.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.020]   You now go from not business owner to business owner,
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.800]   which as you said, is like what the tax code
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.040]   is designed to benefit.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.340]   - Absolutely, and we'll talk a lot about that.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.420]   But really, the more you look at the tax code,
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.860]   you just realize this country
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.300]   favors entrepreneurship so much.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.820]   So my sort of parting advice to W-2 people always
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.140]   is think about the side hustle, think about freelance
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.140]   and think about sort of expanding your horizons.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.940]   And if there's a business you may want to start
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.020]   in the future.
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.540]   - One that I didn't even treat like a business,
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.800]   though I should, and obviously clear this with your company,
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.220]   is there are a bunch of these networks out there,
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:55.220]   GLG, GuidePoint, where as someone who has expertise
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.580]   in an area, I'll put a link to a few of the ones
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.820]   I've done in the past in the show notes,
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.260]   but like they will just reach out to you and say,
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.240]   "Hey, we're doing a study where we wanna talk to people
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.540]   about their expertise in industry X."
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:11.060]   And they might tell you it's $100 an hour,
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.340]   but I've found that you could tell them,
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.540]   "Nah, 600, 900," like whatever.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.660]   And all of a sudden you're driving this number up
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.740]   significantly.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.120]   If you do five or 10 of those a year
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.060]   and you make five to a hundred to a thousand bucks each,
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.620]   that could be some business income that you can offset.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.580]   So we'll get to that.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.260]   But when it comes to side hustles,
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.980]   that's one that I've found,
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.640]   the likelihood of you being a highly paid W-2 employee
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.780]   and having expertise that other people
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.220]   from a research standpoint might want to pay you
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.140]   to tap into, obviously without giving away
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.060]   any kind of proprietary information
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.340]   or breaking any NBAs you've signed with your employer.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.840]   That's one way also to get business income.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.100]   The two slight notes that I'll share.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:56.620]   One, I learned from talking to my tax advisor,
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.380]   just in general, the IRS statistically,
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.300]   returns that are signed by a CPA
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.860]   have a lower audit percentage.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.180]   So I guess one big question here is,
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.700]   when do you think people should consider
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.260]   working with a CPA versus doing this on their own
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.380]   and using something like TurboTax?
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.260]   - I think as soon as you have some degree of complication.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.180]   So I would say, if you have your,
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.140]   if you're a business owner that makes six figures,
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.060]   you probably want someone looking through it
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.940]   just because you'll save more than it is.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.220]   I think TurboTax is fine
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.980]   if you have the simplest financial life ever,
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.900]   which is like, which I did for a while, right?
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.420]   I have a W-2 income and that's really it.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.860]   And then you hit a couple of buttons
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.740]   and let TurboTax kind of do it for you.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.660]   But if you're a business owner,
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:35.760]   if you have real estate investments,
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.780]   if you're doing anything kind of interesting,
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.500]   I think it's absolutely worth having a CPA.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.420]   You also ideally want to, I know this is hard
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.260]   because almost no one is happy with their CPA,
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.700]   finding someone good,
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:46.980]   because there's a lot of CPAs out there
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.060]   that are trying to process the highest quantity of returns.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.140]   And you want someone who kind of is up to date.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.820]   Like, again, we talk a lot about taxes,
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:54.780]   but there've been so many people
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.460]   who listen to something we say,
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.900]   go to their CPA and then their CPA's,
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.780]   "Oh yeah, actually we should do that."
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.380]   So you want to find someone good,
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.860]   but as a business owner,
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.760]   ideally you want to be working with your CPA.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.920]   But again, there's always benefit to listening to stuff
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.360]   like what we're talking about
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.840]   and knowing what to ask your CPA,
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.320]   because even the best CPAs will say it's a partnership.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.240]   It's not like a go figure this out for me.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.920]   It's a partnership between you and them.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.200]   - But I will say the big thing that a CPA will do for you
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.800]   that TurboTax won't.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.640]   I talked about that kind of like alternating strategy.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.280]   A TurboTax is just going to take in all your inputs
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.360]   and give you the answer.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.540]   And they'll fill out the forms
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.720]   and they'll ask you the questions
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.420]   to make sure they don't mix anything,
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.560]   but they're probably not going to bring out the strategy
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.960]   of, "Oh, if you do this thing now versus later,
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.780]   it's going to be better or worse for your situation."
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.040]   So I think that's one.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.840]   And then I've often told the story of the CPA I work with
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.240]   was a company called Gelt.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.000]   And they went back and reviewed past returns
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.160]   and found mistakes that actually netted me
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.400]   like a significant amount of money
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.760]   that I was pretty disappointed in my prior CPA.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.600]   So I would say, if you're a business owner
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.620]   or kind of a high income earner, that makes sense.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:04.820]   If you want to support me,
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.720]   allthehacks.com/Gelt, G-E-L-T is their URL.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.960]   And after we used them, I was like,
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.820]   "Can you guys please be a partner with us?
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.060]   'Cause you guys have been great."
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.020]   So I've been a fan of them.
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.940]   - It's shocking how many tax returns are messed up,
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.660]   especially since we built a tool to analyze tax returns.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.260]   I ran mine through and like, despite being in this space,
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.940]   I found my CPA.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.180]   I'm not going to name them and publicly shame them,
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:32.240]   but there was a year I made $100,000 charitable contribution
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.520]   to my donor advised fund.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.200]   They skipped it and took the standard deduction.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.920]   So just like really bad stuff.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.600]   - The firm that I used that made a mistake
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.320]   was a very reputable firm and they just made a mistake.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.160]   And I've actually talked-
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:43.980]   - We'll talk offline.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.400]   Mine is a reputable firm too, maybe it's the same one.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.440]   - And funny enough, I've talked to a few people
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.000]   that have very complicated tax situations
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.660]   who make a lot of money.
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.600]   And they actually hire two firms
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.280]   to prepare their taxes each year and compare notes.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.460]   Because it's just, even with the best firms,
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.920]   people make mistakes.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.360]   - Like we built a really simple tool
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.040]   that literally you just upload your tax return
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.040]   and it shows you like all the numbers in a nice format.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:07.920]   And that's how I found it.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.880]   'Cause like, who's going to look through a tax return?
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.600]   - Yeah, so I played with this tool.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.240]   It's at decode.tax.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.120]   Can you touch on the privacy side of it?
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.000]   'Cause I know one thing that when I first used it,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.940]   I was like, God, do I really want to upload a return
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.880]   with my name, social address,
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.000]   and all my personal financial details?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.180]   - So, I mean, a few different things.
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.200]   One, you can always like remove your name
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.840]   and all of that from the return itself.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.700]   Like the tech, basically it's OCR.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.800]   It scans for the important numbers and pulls them.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.280]   But beyond that, a few different things.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.520]   One, you can delete your data at any point.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.320]   So what a lot of people do is they'll like upload it
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.000]   and then just immediately delete it.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.160]   Two, even if you don't delete it,
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.240]   like we don't share that data with absolutely anyone.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.520]   Like it's literally just stored in our database.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.160]   Third is like no identifying information is stored
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.640]   as we're storing that data.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.000]   You know, we're just like pulling the numbers
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:53.880]   and storing that part.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.920]   But yeah, a lot of people just end up
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.120]   deleting it right after.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.760]   'Cause obviously privacy and stuff is super important here.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.880]   - What I did was the Preview app on Mac
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.560]   has a really good redacting tool.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.860]   And so I just pulled it up, redacted, redacted, redacted,
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.700]   and ran through, so.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.900]   - It would still work totally fine, yep.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.140]   - I got all the numbers out of it.
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.380]   So I'll link to that tool in the show notes.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.540]   And we mentioned CPAs.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.740]   One stat I learned recently was that,
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:17.340]   'cause the IRS publishes a lot of stats,
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.660]   that returns signed by a CPA
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.580]   end up having a lower audit risk.
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.980]   So I would just say,
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.460]   if your tax situation is very complicated,
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:29.140]   just another one in the corner of go with the CPA.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.560]   And then this is a bit of a strange note,
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.080]   but recently I was trying to kind of model out
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.980]   a couple alternatives of what to do for taxes.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.400]   And I found while I wouldn't have them prepare a tax return
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.820]   or write anything for you,
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.040]   ChatGPT is really good at tax questions.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.500]   Like really, really good.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:50.220]   And so I had a question around S-Corp elections
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.140]   and whether it made sense
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.860]   and how it would affect my future social security benefits.
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:56.580]   And it took my verbal input, built out a model,
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.660]   explained it.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:58.500]   So I would say,
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.860]   if you're listening to any of this and you have questions,
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.560]   don't replace your CPA with AI,
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.940]   but absolutely ask ChatGPT questions
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.000]   and the results are pretty good.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.620]   - Again, I do want to caveat though, they're pretty good.
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.580]   Like we, for instance, when we built our tax tool,
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.260]   we actually first loaded a lot of it into GPT.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:16.700]   We got a lot of good data,
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.420]   but at the end of the day, every once in a while,
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.340]   could be one in a hundred, one in a thousand,
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.300]   AI does kind of hallucinate right now.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.400]   So don't let that be the be-all and end-all of advice.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.260]   Absolutely use ChatGPT as one data point,
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.200]   but it can't be the sort of sole deciding factor
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.840]   in any sort of strategy you do.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.300]   And again, so we actually ended up pulling out
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.820]   the AI component for now.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.260]   It just needs to be kind of tightly leashed a little bit
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.220]   because once in a while,
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.500]   it would just kind of do bad things.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.680]   - If you're asking a question like,
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.580]   how does capital gains tax work?
[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:50.500]   And you want someone to explain it to you,
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.620]   where previously it was like find a friend
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.380]   or pay your accountant, you know,
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.980]   a high hourly fee to explain things to you.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.260]   I think that's where it's becoming
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.180]   pretty big handy with me.
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.020]   - Yep, absolutely.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.300]   But don't tell it like, what should I do for taxes?
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.980]   And then blindly follow its advice without, you know,
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.460]   kind of double checking with the CPA or whatever.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.300]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.540]   Okay, so another big area is investments.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.740]   And I think a lot of the things in this area
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.780]   apply broadly to everyone.
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.020]   You don't need to be a business owner for many of them.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.200]   So maybe let's jump in and start with
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.540]   kind of the one you highlighted is who the tax code is for.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.820]   And it's people that are involved in real estate.
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.820]   - Yeah, so two big categories of people
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.180]   that like the tax code benefits, like as an asset class,
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.420]   I think real estate is amongst
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.280]   the most tax advantaged asset class out there.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.260]   The one other thing that may compete is like startups,
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.580]   especially with the new sort of QSBS rules.
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.900]   But those categories are just like tax advantaged
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.420]   asset classes that have all these benefits built into them.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.180]   Should we dive into real estate?
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.020]   - Yeah, let's do it.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.160]   - Cool, let's talk about owning your own home.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.160]   Even that is something that the government
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.560]   clearly wants us to do.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.440]   For instance, you can take not a lot of money,
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.040]   but $10,000 out from any retirement account
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.000]   at any time to buy your first home.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.800]   Like it doesn't matter if you're 25 years old,
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.200]   35 years old, 45 years old,
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.680]   you don't have to wait for retirement to do that.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.740]   When you sell your home or a home you've lived in
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.620]   for two out of the last five years,
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.680]   you pay no taxes and up to half a million dollars
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.660]   if you're married on the gain for that home.
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.280]   Even the way mortgages kind of work, right?
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.880]   It gives you the ability to lock in
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.440]   a predetermined interest rate,
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.000]   protecting you from rising interest rates in the future.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.480]   The interest rates fall, you can always refinance it,
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.780]   all while mortgage interest in turn is tax deductible.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.200]   So all of these things have been created
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:39.320]   to like really get Americans to buy a home.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.560]   And as a result, I think something like 50% of people
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.120]   in this country own their home,
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.600]   which is a staggering number
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.040]   compared to the rest of the world.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.360]   And that's just for your own home.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.440]   When you get into commercial,
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.880]   there's a whole other bunch of benefits.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.920]   The one thing that I find, you know,
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.320]   obviously as I explain it,
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.320]   you have to be in a fortunate financial position,
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.040]   but that $750,000 limit.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:00.920]   So for people who don't know,
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.880]   you can deduct your home mortgage interest up to $750,000.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.880]   However, there is a tactic that I've learned
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.960]   from a lot of people who have significant savings,
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.800]   where one of the other things that is deductible
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.000]   in the itemized deductions is investment interest.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.600]   And so that would be if you take out a margin loan
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.960]   and invest that money,
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.440]   the interest you pay to borrow money
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.560]   for the purpose of investing is deductible.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.840]   Well, one thing that a lot of people have been doing,
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.920]   especially in California,
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.760]   where there's a lot of cash buyers,
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.680]   is if you buy a home in cash
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.080]   and then you do a mortgage after the fact,
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.000]   the money doesn't actually go to the seller
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.520]   because you already bought the home.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.960]   So what happens is if you bought a $2 million home,
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.260]   then you refinance it,
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.680]   which is kind of technically what's happening
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.960]   'cause you've already bought it.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.440]   Let's say you keep 500,000 in as equity,
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.200]   you're gonna get a $1.5 million wire into your bank account.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.040]   And if you take that $1.5 million,
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.720]   and one thing that's very important
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.880]   is that you need to be able to trace the path of it.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.360]   But if you take that $1.5 million and go invest it,
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.540]   put it in a brokerage account,
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.720]   put it in treasury bills, whatever it is,
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.520]   now to the IRS,
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:12.320]   you can classify the interest you're paying to the bank
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.760]   as investment interest
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.880]   because it is a loan that you invested the proceeds of.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.400]   And that's one tactic to increase
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:23.240]   the interest deduction limit of 750,000 on real estate.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.080]   - That's genius.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.000]   That's another thing I never knew.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.120]   That's awesome.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.600]   - So the other way that's gonna be really relevant
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.880]   to people as homes appreciate,
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.920]   especially if your home appreciates
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.620]   and the interest rates drop,
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:35.880]   is this doesn't have to be,
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.840]   I can buy the whole house with cash.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:41.880]   Let's say you buy a home and you buy it for $500,000
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:45.780]   and it goes up because if I remember correctly,
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.840]   the $750,000 limit is locked in at the price
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.720]   when you first get the mortgage.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.720]   And so if your home appreciates,
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.880]   you can do what's called a cash out refinance,
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.000]   which lets you take equity out of the home
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.520]   and refinance your mortgage.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.380]   Very few people are gonna be doing that right now
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.520]   because interest rates for almost everyone
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.080]   are higher today than they were when they got their home.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.720]   But in the future, interest rates drop
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.900]   and now you have really low interest rates again
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.520]   and your home has appreciated,
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.100]   or even you've paid it off enough
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.700]   that there's a lot of equity value.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:17.940]   When you do that refinance and you get that money out,
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.740]   it's gonna be hard in many cases
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:22.060]   to claim your new mortgage interest
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.260]   as deductible to the full extent
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.500]   because it's higher than it was when you bought your home.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.380]   But if you take that cash out and you invest it,
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:31.580]   similarly, if you work with a CPA,
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:32.580]   you can validate this
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:34.500]   and make sure you're doing it correctly,
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.960]   but you can classify the cash you took out
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:40.240]   and that portion of your mortgage as investment interest
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.560]   and it qualifies as an itemized deduction.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.360]   The big important caveat is you have to follow
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.160]   what's called interest tracing guidelines.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.200]   I'll try to link in the show notes to a couple articles
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.840]   about this tactic and interest tracing,
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.400]   but you really wanna be able to show here's the money,
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.120]   it went into this other bank account
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.480]   that I opened separately,
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.680]   it didn't get commingled with my expenses
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.400]   and all of my personal finances,
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.520]   and then it went directly into an investment.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.800]   So in the future, when interest rates are lower,
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.880]   you may wanna cash out refinance, that's a tactic.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.000]   But for people right now who have a lot of cash
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.080]   and are buying a home
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.400]   and are scared about these interest rates
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.600]   and their mortgage is gonna be over $750,000,
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.320]   you could potentially, if you're at the highest tax bracket,
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.720]   kind of cut the mortgage rate in half
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:28.360]   if you can make it deductible beyond 750,000.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.200]   - That's awesome.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.320]   Is there a cap on the maximum amount of investment interest,
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.360]   income interest costs that you can deduct?
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.960]   - Yeah, so you need, and again, not a CPA,
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.480]   but my understanding is that you need to deduct
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.640]   that investment interest expense from investment income.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.120]   So the cap would be how much income
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.520]   did the investment generate.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.680]   Generally, and the advice I got from a CPA
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:56.520]   was that it's not just the income from that investment,
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.280]   it's all of your investment income.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.200]   But typically, if you figure interest rates
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.680]   are usually not that far off from your investment returns,
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.280]   so as long as this isn't all of your investments,
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.560]   you are likely to have more investment income.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.400]   - Got it.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.120]   But presumably your investment income
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.800]   is like what's been realized, right?
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:15.920]   Like you could theoretically--
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.480]   - Yes, yeah, so it'd have to be interest paid out
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.160]   or dividends or realized capital gains
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.000]   or anything like that.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.160]   But I would imagine that for most people
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.200]   who are buying a home
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.040]   where the mortgage interest is above 750,000,
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.080]   they are probably in a situation where,
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.680]   and they have the cash to buy a home using this tactic,
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.600]   they probably also have investments
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.760]   that are spitting off investment income to deduct from.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.040]   - Makes a ton of sense.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.480]   All right, let's pivot to commercial real estate.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.480]   So again, if you look at some of the wealthiest people
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.560]   in America, you'll find that a lot of them
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.840]   eventually end up buying real estate.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.680]   Some of them start with it,
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.360]   but a lot of them eventually end up buying real estate.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.040]   And that's 'cause commercial real estate
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.880]   just also gives you a ton of benefits.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:56.720]   - And just to be clear,
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.120]   when you say commercial real estate,
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.400]   you don't necessarily mean buy an office building,
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.200]   you mean buying real estate as a business--
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.160]   - As a business activity, you're right.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.680]   That's a very good clarification.
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.120]   And yeah, I should, by that I mean not your primary home,
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.480]   but real estate you invest in as an investment.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.520]   That's probably a better word.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.360]   - Or a rental property.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.520]   - Yep, basically any real estate that you're buying
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.320]   for the purpose of making an income
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.760]   rather than living in it yourself.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.960]   So a few different things that are important to touch on.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.920]   One is, we could have covered this
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.680]   in the capital gain section as well,
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.920]   but if you have a capital gain,
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.360]   you can actually defer paying taxes on that capital gain
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.560]   till 2026 by investing in an opportunity zone.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:36.240]   I don't know if you've covered that in previous episodes.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.760]   - That is one where if we did, it was briefly.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.800]   So let's touch on that and then talk about
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.480]   kind of more broad real estate investing.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.600]   - Oh yeah, we'll talk about opportunity zones real quick.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:48.120]   The way they work is the government wanted to incentivize
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.280]   investments in certain underdeveloped areas.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.800]   And you can basically take dollars from any capital gain,
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.240]   short-term or long-term,
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.800]   and within 180 days,
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.320]   invest it in what's called a qualified opportunity zone
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.680]   fund, which is a fund to develop properties
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.640]   in these qualified opportunity zones.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.160]   What's fascinating about these opportunity zones is,
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.000]   at least in New York,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.120]   I don't know how it works in other cities,
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:13.000]   is a lot of them have happened to be in very trendy areas
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.560]   because they're based on 20-year-old census data.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.920]   So like I live in Williamsburg,
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.320]   which is a trendy neighborhood in New York now,
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.080]   it wasn't so much 20 years ago,
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.080]   but a lot of parts around here are characterized
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.040]   as an opportunity zone.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.000]   So I know a lot of people that have set up
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.280]   qualified opportunity zone funds themselves
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.240]   and are buying these properties
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.520]   and this gives you two big benefits.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.720]   One, you can defer paying capital gains till 2026,
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.600]   but more than that,
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.360]   if you hold on to that investment for 10 years,
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.600]   you get an automatic step up in basis.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.560]   What that means is 10 years from now,
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.760]   whatever the property is worth,
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.280]   that's your new cost price,
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.800]   or if you were to sell at that price, there's no taxes.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.160]   So it's kind of a cool strategy if you end up at a point
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.000]   where you have a large capital gain
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.760]   and you are interested in commercial real estate,
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.960]   as well as all the other tax benefits
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.960]   we're going to talk about
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.240]   that can be combined with opportunity zones.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.600]   - Okay, so that means like if I bought Tesla stock
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.600]   and I'm now sitting on a big amount of Tesla stock
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.640]   that's up 10X, but I don't want to hold it anymore,
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:11.040]   I can sell it, invest those proceeds in an opportunity zone,
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.960]   hold it for 10 years and kind of avoid all of those taxes.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.800]   - Yeah, yeah, and you get an automatic step up in basis,
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.320]   which we talked about happens at death,
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.120]   but otherwise it's very rare
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.280]   to get an automatic step up in basis.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.440]   And you do that and you get that with opportunity zones.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.200]   Again, I wouldn't do this
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.920]   unless you're interested in real estate
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.200]   and would be investing in real estate already,
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.240]   because again, this does take time.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.720]   But otherwise, if you are interested,
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.480]   it's absolutely worth thinking about,
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.320]   at least looking up,
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.000]   what are the opportunity zones in your city?
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.200]   You can always Google the name
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.320]   of your city opportunity zones, see a map,
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.320]   like the one in New York is very favorable.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.120]   So I know a lot of people that have been doing it.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.320]   But cool, that's opportunity zones.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.440]   Outside of that, let's talk about some of the bigger benefits
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.040]   of investing in real estate for income.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.400]   Two very big ones that are super important.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:58.920]   One is this idea of a 1031 exchange.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.160]   And what that means is if you buy a property
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.960]   as an investment, and then sell that property,
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.280]   you have the opportunity
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.720]   to take the entire pre-tax proceeds.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.200]   So whatever you'd make from selling this,
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.880]   the entire amount into a bigger and more expensive property
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.600]   without paying any taxes.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.400]   What's cool is you can kind of do it
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.040]   an unlimited number of times.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.240]   You can start with a $100,000 property,
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.920]   then a $200,000 property,
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.320]   and kind of keep buying bigger and better properties
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:29.120]   while continually deferring taxes.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.480]   - And the other thing is you can keep doing that.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.040]   And someone might think, well, what if I need the money?
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.400]   But a lot of these properties
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.040]   are gonna be spitting off money throughout the year.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.720]   So it's not that you don't have a way
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.160]   to make money from your real estate.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.160]   It's just that you can avoid the taxes
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.400]   on buying and selling.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.440]   - Absolutely, makes a huge difference.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:48.920]   The other big category of why people invest in real estate
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.120]   is this idea of depreciation.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.320]   Some people go far enough to call it
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.400]   the eighth wonder of the world.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.000]   But the way depreciation works
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.640]   is when you buy any physical asset,
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.200]   let's say you buy a building,
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.920]   it loses value over time, right?
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:04.160]   Depreciation refers to the loss of value over time.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:06.080]   And some people call it a phantom loss
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.400]   because it's not taking money from your pocket,
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.520]   but this building has lost some value year over year
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.480]   because it's older and worthless.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.640]   And you can claim that as a loss
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.560]   either against your real estate income,
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.000]   if you're just doing this as something on the side,
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.240]   or if you somehow can classify yourself
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.640]   as a real estate professional,
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.600]   you can use that depreciation
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.080]   to actually offset other income as well.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.480]   - Okay, so we get depreciate.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.960]   I believe there are some things,
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.280]   if you do a cost segregation study,
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.520]   you not only can depreciate over the life,
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.800]   but you can actually accelerate certain items
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.680]   and take it all up front or 80% of it up front.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.360]   And I think I heard you say in another thing
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.760]   that in certain cases,
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.560]   you can depreciate 20 to 25% of the entire value
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.560]   in the first year.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:52.160]   - Correct, so again, back to Trump,
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.640]   2017 Jobs Act, right, that Trump did.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.360]   Again, I mean, who is Trump?
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.480]   Like, who is he trying to favor?
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.920]   Real estate developers is a big part of it.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.320]   So what he did is you can take any property.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:04.840]   Let's say we have a building.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.440]   I can get what's called a cost segregation study.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.040]   And what that is, it's a study,
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.240]   it'll cost a few thousand dollars.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.520]   Someone will come look at my building.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.280]   They'll be like, one, this is the cost of your land.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.600]   Land can never be depreciated.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.040]   Everything else gets depreciated to zero,
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.040]   but land does not lose value.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.120]   But everything else, they'll come up with like,
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.360]   oh, your windows are worth X dollars.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.440]   Your HVAC is worth Y dollars.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.760]   And anything that has a schedule of less than 15 years,
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.000]   like all of these things
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.640]   typically have different schedules.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.720]   Anything less than 15 years,
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:37.800]   80% of it can be depreciated year one out of 2023.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.800]   Next year, it drops to 60%.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.920]   But the upshot of all of this
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:43.360]   is very often you can buy a property
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.400]   and get almost 20% of the purchase price
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.040]   as a year one deduction,
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.120]   which is very relevant
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.640]   'cause sometimes your cash down payment is also 20%, right?
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.640]   So it's a very, very efficient way of building wealth
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.520]   for people that are interested in it.
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.120]   - And the income from this,
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.840]   or the lack of income 'cause you've deducted all of it,
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.520]   is that only from your real estate taxes
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.320]   or can it also go off your primary income?
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.200]   - So this is where it gets a little bit tricky, right?
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.160]   So in general, for most people,
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.840]   let's say you're a W-2 employee,
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.400]   this will help offset your real estate income.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.760]   But let's imagine you wanted to offset
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.680]   your other non-real estate income.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.560]   There's a few sort of ways it can happen.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.920]   I say this facetiously,
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.880]   but like when people with a high W-2 salary ask me like,
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.560]   "Okay, what should I do to save money in taxes?"
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.120]   I'm like, "Marry a real estate professional."
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.080]   But very often that does work very well
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.840]   'cause if you or your spouse are a real estate professional,
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.680]   you can offset all your income with depreciation.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.720]   But being a real estate professional is hard.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.000]   It takes 750 hours a year
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.080]   and you have to show that this is your primary job.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.200]   So it's very, very unlikely you can qualify
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.400]   if you have a high W-2
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.000]   to also qualify as a real estate professional,
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.880]   which is why having a spouse that's a real estate professional
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.920]   can be a very potent combination, right?
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.600]   Someone who has a high-paying tech job, for instance,
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.960]   pairing with a real estate professional,
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.880]   y'all can buy investment properties
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.720]   and use that depreciation to not pay any taxes
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.080]   on the other spouse's Facebook salary, for instance.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.880]   So super effective combination.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.120]   - And are there any other ways to be able to do it?
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.080]   - There's another way,
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.840]   which is if you use the property
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.440]   for primarily short-term rentals
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.360]   and you're somewhat involved in running that process,
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.080]   the IRS takes the stance that that's an active business
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.440]   and as a result, you can offset regular income.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.720]   So it's a little tricky,
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.360]   but I have seen people pull it off
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.520]   where let's say they own a building,
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.760]   they're staying in one of the floors,
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.600]   another floor is an Airbnb
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.920]   and they're using that depreciation.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.760]   So the short-term rental loophole also exists.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.040]   We could talk about it a little bit
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.080]   in the business owner section,
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.520]   but I've also seen people buy real estate
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.520]   with their business.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.720]   So if they have an office, buying the office building,
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.640]   if they have a storefront, buying that physical asset
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.680]   and using that depreciation
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.160]   against their business owner income,
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.200]   even if it's not connected to real estate.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.600]   - And if you needed one more reason
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.440]   to know that we're favoring real estate,
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.040]   I believe if you have a side hustle that is freelance work,
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.880]   you have to pay self-employment taxes.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.840]   But if you have a side hustle that's a rental property,
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.240]   you don't, is that right?
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240]   - Yep, it's crazy.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.040]   But yeah, no self-employment taxes on rental income.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:18.880]   - It's crazy.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.120]   Okay, so that's real estate.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.560]   One that I think a lot of people here
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.520]   haven't heard talked about on the show
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.920]   that is relatively new,
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.280]   but really, really interesting is solar.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.120]   - Commercial solar.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.600]   Again, this goes back to Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.600]   There were a ton of incentives created for solar investing.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.200]   And as it stands today, I still think of solar
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.520]   as like it's a subset of real estate.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.120]   It's still sort of a type of real estate,
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.240]   but commercial solar, in addition to depreciation,
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.920]   also gives you tax credits.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.200]   And sometimes tax credits can be up to 40%
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.600]   of your investment.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.080]   And worth noting,
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.640]   a tax credit is not the same as a tax deduction.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.760]   A tax deduction reduces your taxable income.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.880]   So you save your tax rate into the tax deduction.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.280]   A tax credit is a dollar for dollar reduction
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.640]   in taxes paid.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.640]   So it's super, super powerful where,
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.040]   let's say you invest a million dollars
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.040]   and get a $400,000 tax credit,
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.040]   that directly reduces your taxes by $400,000.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.600]   That can be applied moving forward.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.480]   It can also go back a couple of years.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.960]   Super, super powerful,
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.200]   because when you combine that with depreciation,
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.240]   and typically commercial solar also spins off income,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.320]   very often, you're getting 70 to 80% of the money
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.520]   back in tax savings right away
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.320]   with the income then coming in and compounding on top.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.040]   - Yeah, so if you're a high W-2 earner
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.840]   or a business owner with a lot of income,
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.920]   I have not seen a strategy for reducing your taxes
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.040]   that is better than solar.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.040]   - It's wild how big the effect is.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.280]   And again, just to like quickly break it down,
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.960]   you get the tax credit, you get the depreciation.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.200]   A lot of it can be,
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.440]   the depreciation can be front-loaded
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.360]   and bonus depreciated as well.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:57.280]   And then typically these projects will pay
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.360]   like 5% or so of your investment every year
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.840]   based on the energy generated
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.440]   from the solar projects for 20 years.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.400]   So you kind of get that back as well.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.120]   And a more advanced tactic I've seen people do
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.640]   is you can take that income
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.920]   and put that back into a tax advantage account
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.760]   and not even pay taxes on the income itself.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.840]   So lots of levels to this.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.000]   - But does it need some amount of solar professional
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.360]   similar to real estate?
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.520]   - Yeah, so if you wanna offset your active income,
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.440]   which most people would want to,
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.360]   you wanna ideally be classified as a solar professional,
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.520]   but the advantage is being a solar professional
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.680]   is maybe 10 times easier than your real estate professional
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.280]   because a solar professional, you need 100 hours a year,
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.880]   which is about eight hours a month,
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.040]   which is not that much.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.560]   I mean, you probably have to tour the site
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.640]   a couple of times, go to a solar conference.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.920]   It's a lot easier to hit a solar professional status.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.960]   Real estate professional is really, really hard.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.360]   You can't half-ass it.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.680]   Solar can kind of be the side hustle that you do
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.120]   and hit solar professional status.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.680]   - And where do you find these projects?
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.400]   Like commercial solar projects,
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.880]   is there an easy way to find them?
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.680]   - We've been partnering a bunch with Valure,
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.120]   and I know you had Mani on your podcast as well.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.120]   They have a bunch of solar projects that have been doing that
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.000]   so I've been working a lot with them and other providers.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.720]   - Okay, we'll link to that in the show notes.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.320]   But you said earlier investing in startups
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.160]   is pretty lucrative.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.480]   So let's run through that a little.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.320]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:17.400]   So there's probably the most generous tax break
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.840]   by just raw size is something called QSBS
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.880]   or Qualified Small Business Stock.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.560]   And that allows anyone who either invests in a startup,
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.200]   works for a startup, or starts a startup,
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.320]   and there's a few rules.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.640]   It has to be a qualifying startup.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.640]   It has to have less than 50 million in assets
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.400]   when you invest or buy shares.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.360]   What you can get is no taxes and up to $10 million
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.960]   when you sell that stake
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.360]   as long as you hold your shares for five years,
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.080]   which is, it's just massive.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.040]   And it's something that I personally benefited from
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.600]   when I sold my last company.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.080]   But interestingly, it also applies
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.960]   to people who invest in these startups.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.560]   So it's something that I've seen awareness has spread
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.000]   so more people are doing this,
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.800]   but it's a $10 million break from federal taxes
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.000]   and in 42 states, no state taxes as well.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.280]   So super, super effective.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.960]   And there's actually even strategies
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.760]   that you can use to multiply that benefit
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.680]   from $10 million to 20, 30, or $40 million.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.920]   So if you are inclined to work with or invest in startups,
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.800]   again, you need a startup to be successful,
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   which the odds aren't great, but if it happens,
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.960]   you get to keep almost all of the money.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.440]   - And I'll just clarify.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.960]   Oftentimes, I think of startups as like tech companies.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.560]   It's really any business, right?
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.400]   It doesn't have to be a venture-backed tech company.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.120]   - It has to be a C corporation,
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.720]   and that's sort of the main rule.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.520]   And very often, people who set up C corporations
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.880]   are those that raise external capital
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.520]   or plan to go public in the future,
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.600]   but it does not have to be a tech company at all.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.240]   But it's not possible with an LLC or an S corporation.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.960]   For the first time, I'm seeing some people
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.120]   set up C corporations just for the benefit
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.360]   'cause the size of benefit is so large here.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.680]   - And a couple other caveats.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.600]   One, I know that, let's say you invest
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.000]   in one of these companies and it does really well,
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.280]   but it's only in three years.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.120]   You can actually roll over those gains
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.640]   into, I think they're like QSBS rollover funds
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:04.880]   or new companies, and similar to a 1031 exchange,
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.160]   you can extend that runway until it gets to five years,
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.560]   and then you can take your money out tax-free.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.280]   - You could do it in a company you start as well.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.400]   Like you could literally be like,
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.760]   "Oh, this investment is going to hit,
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.200]   and I can start my own C corp
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.480]   because I wanna start my own startup,"
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.120]   and immediately roll that pre-tax dollar amount in.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.360]   So super effective.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.840]   The other cool thing about QSBS
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.800]   is the limit is per company per taxpayer.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.280]   So if you invest in 10 companies,
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.440]   each of these companies will have
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.160]   their own $10 million limit.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.960]   The other thing is it's per taxpayer.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.960]   So what I did with this company, for instance,
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.800]   is I gave some shares to my mom,
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.520]   some shares to my dad, some shares to my brother,
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.120]   and now each of us have our own
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.600]   $10 million theoretical limit.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.640]   As a household, it can be a 30 or $40 million limit.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.920]   - But like you said,
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.520]   this is not a strategy without risk, right?
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.880]   Most startups fail.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.280]   Both the startups I worked for and started
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.640]   are not around, actually all three of them.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.520]   And so I still, my advice is,
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.960]   if you wanna invest in startups,
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.520]   it's a losing game, but you can win big,
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.120]   but keep it to a small single-digit percentage
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.800]   of your net worth. - Absolutely.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.920]   - Because the odds are not in your favor.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.560]   But I believe if you do lose money,
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.080]   you can also write it off as a startup investment.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.760]   - The actionable thing here
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.560]   is I think more for startup founders
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.720]   where what I have done this time,
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.880]   and I would encourage other founders
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.720]   if they're listening to,
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.920]   is be conscious of the five-year clock
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.160]   and try and make sure your employees participate in it.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.560]   And I'll give you an example.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.200]   At my last company, we gave our early team stock options.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.680]   So a lot of them didn't exercise it
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.440]   until year one or year two.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.360]   And as a result, they weren't at the five-year mark,
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.720]   even though it had been six years since we sold the company.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.640]   This time around, I'm giving everyone shares
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:40.480]   they can buy up front
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.000]   and get the QSPS clock started sooner for them.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.320]   That's something actionable.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.040]   - Yeah, if you work at a company,
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.760]   and it's not the valuation, it's the assets.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.320]   But if you work at a company,
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.520]   my wife worked at Lyft.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.400]   And by the time we realized this,
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.720]   the company had already raised more than $50 million
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.640]   and it was too late.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.560]   So if you're just an employee of a company
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.280]   that's assets are worth less than 50 million,
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:04.640]   that's a good time to think about exercising your stock.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.680]   But one investment tax break around exercising stock
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.600]   is if you work for a company
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.800]   and you hold incentive stock options or ISOs,
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.440]   a lot of the challenges around taxes
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.400]   and where you might wanna work with a CPA
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.280]   is that when you exercise that stock,
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.040]   you can trigger something called AMT,
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.840]   which is the alternative minimum tax.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.480]   But there's usually a threshold every year
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.160]   where you could exercise some of your stock
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.320]   without triggering additional taxes.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.400]   And so that's a way that early on
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.560]   in the life cycle of a company,
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.520]   if you're holding incentive stock options,
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.320]   you can start to slowly exercise them
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.080]   without any additional taxes.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.160]   - Yep, you said everything I need to there, so.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.280]   - A couple of quick other ones
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.000]   that I'll share in the investment space.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.200]   So one, there are a lot of government securities
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.320]   that save you money on state and local taxes
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.000]   with high interest rate environment.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.920]   One thing I didn't talk about in the past
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.360]   'cause that wasn't the case,
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.600]   investing in treasury bills
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.440]   or funds that invest in treasury bills
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.600]   or state muni bonds can save you taxes on the gains.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.720]   Obviously, those come with some risks
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.080]   depending on what state you're in
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.560]   and what type of investment,
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.880]   but that is one way to limit your investment taxes.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.800]   - That's a really good point,
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.360]   especially because some people will look at
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.320]   a high yield checking account offering 5% or whatever,
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.240]   buying the equivalent yield or more
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.880]   in let's say a mutual fund that only invests in treasuries.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.320]   And if you live in California, New York,
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.360]   you're saving an additional 10%
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.880]   by going with the treasury mutual fund
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.040]   versus your high interest checking account
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.640]   because of not paying state taxes.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.640]   - And that's not 10%, like five plus 10, 15%,
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.760]   but boost that return.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.120]   So like divide the number by 0.9
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.560]   if you're in the highest tax bracket.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.400]   - Up your knees.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.240]   - If you're getting 5% on your treasury bill fund,
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.560]   it's like you're getting 5.5%
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.880]   or similar in the high yield savings account.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.400]   Another one for someone who has a lot of stock
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.680]   in an individual company,
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.600]   there's these things called exchange funds.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.480]   So there's one that I recently came across
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.720]   called the usecash.com.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.400]   I don't have any affiliation with them.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.480]   They basically pool together investors
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.360]   who have large positions in companies
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.120]   that are in the tech sector.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.080]   They let you contribute your Facebook, Microsoft,
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.880]   Amazon, Netflix, whatever stock to a fund.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.040]   And in return, you get shares of that fund
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.680]   without triggering any taxable situation.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.120]   So if you are really, really heavy on a tech stock
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.560]   from an employment or an investment,
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.440]   and you want to diversify,
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.440]   but you don't wanna realize capital gains right now,
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.840]   you can use a company like Cash or any other exchange fund
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.560]   and find a way to push out the capital gains,
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.920]   but also diversify.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.920]   - Do you know what their fees are?
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.840]   I love exchange funds,
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.600]   but most of them I've seen just have such high fees.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.240]   So similar to, I think, what you guys are doing with Cary,
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.840]   what we did at Wealthfront,
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.000]   it's leveraging technology to bring down the cost
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.640]   of a lot of these things.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.760]   And so in the past, I can't remember what their fees are,
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.160]   but I'm looking on the site,
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.960]   0.4 to 0.8% management fee based on contribution.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.400]   No performance fee, no sales fee.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.240]   - Okay, cool.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.760]   That's, yeah, that's definitely much, much better
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.280]   'cause yeah, the products I've seen pitched
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.400]   are 1% to 2%, which are so high.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.280]   0.8 is still probably a tad higher than I'd like,
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.560]   but yeah, it's definitely moving the right direction.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.360]   - And then last, we talked about trusts.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.320]   I think we'll skip over all the different types of trusts
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.560]   you can use to offset capital gain,
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.680]   to move stock places so you get access to money.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.240]   Go back and listen to the episode I did
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.720]   with Manny from Valor.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.960]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.360]   And I think that's it for everything non-business owner.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.760]   So we talked a bunch earlier about ways
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.040]   to generate business income if you're not already
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.160]   starting a side hustle, getting into real estate,
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.920]   even asking your employer to help you out
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.000]   by making some of your income, 1099 income,
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.240]   consulting income instead of just W-2 salary.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.120]   And then obviously there's start a business.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.640]   So let's talk about things for people
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.040]   who've started those businesses or want to in the future
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.880]   and why that's really valuable.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.360]   Let's start with the benefits of the QBI deduction.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.560]   - Yeah, so I mean, again, if you ever want proof
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.000]   that the tax code is like rigged for business owners,
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   consider like two things.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.760]   Again, both are from the 2017 Trump Jobs Act or whatever.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.640]   One is the QBI deduction where they basically decided
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.360]   to give a bunch of business owners a free 20% deduction
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.560]   just because there's some rules around it
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.320]   for high income earners specifically
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.720]   and how you optimize that.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.280]   But for most people, it's an automatic,
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.320]   up to 20% deduction right there
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.880]   just for being a business owner.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.400]   The other one that we talked about a little bit before
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.920]   is if you're not a business owner,
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.040]   you actually can't deduct more than $10,000 worth
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.880]   of state and local taxes.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.080]   But in response to that,
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.400]   a lot of states created legislation
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:45.680]   that let you pay an elective tax from your business entity
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.600]   whereby you can pay the entire state tax amount
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.680]   through your business entity
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.360]   and thereby bypass the $10,000 limit
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.040]   and get a deduction for the entire amount
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.520]   of state taxes paid.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.040]   - That's a pass through exemption, I believe, right?
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.840]   If someone's looking to kind of Google and search up more.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.800]   - Every state has structured it a little bit differently.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.520]   Like the rules vary a little bit by state,
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.840]   but yeah, in a lot of cases, it's an elective tax.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.040]   So if you're in California, if you are in New York,
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.000]   if you're in a high income state
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   and most of your income is business owner income,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.320]   make sure your CPA is doing that
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.560]   or make sure you're thinking about that
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.840]   because in a lot of cases, it's an elective tax.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.360]   So if you don't know, you're not gonna do it
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.040]   and you may miss out.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.040]   - This is another great place where TurboTax
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.120]   is not gonna say, "Hey, do you wanna do this other thing?"
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.880]   It's gonna say, "Hey, did you do this thing?"
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.400]   Can they pass on property tax
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.480]   or is it only state income tax?
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.400]   - I think it's primarily state income tax
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.960]   or anything attributable to the business.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.360]   So my guess is if it's something,
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.200]   property under the business is probably fine,
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.960]   but not if it's under you individually.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.560]   Also, some states are fine with LLC,
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.240]   some states require S-Corps,
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.880]   so it depends a little bit on that.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.240]   While we're on the topic of QBI,
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.480]   which we briefly talked about,
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.040]   if you're a high income earner,
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:55.040]   which I think is 160,000 single, 320,000 as a couple,
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.040]   your QBI is also limited by 50% of the wages paid.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.360]   And if you have an S-Corp, for instance,
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.640]   we didn't talk a lot about, maybe we will later,
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.480]   there may be a temptation to pay yourself
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.160]   the lowest W-2 salary possible.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.400]   But because of QBI,
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.920]   sometimes you would wanna pay yourself
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.040]   a slightly higher W-2 salary
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.400]   to maximize the amount of taxes you save on.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.400]   So my recommendation overall is if you're a high income earner,
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.080]   have an accountant, have someone qualified,
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.600]   run the calculation on what is the precise amount
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.440]   you should pay yourself.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.400]   'Cause there's one specific dollar number in salary
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.840]   that will reduce your taxes
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.440]   because you have to balance self-employment taxes and QBI
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.640]   to find the perfect number
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.000]   that results in the lowest amount of taxes.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.640]   - The team I was working with at Gelt,
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.680]   I have a spreadsheet that we just went through
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.680]   and the result was the amount of money
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.480]   I should pay myself as a salary
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.800]   was higher than I had expected.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.480]   - Correct, and that's what happened because of QBI, exactly.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.720]   And again, if someone's like,
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.240]   "Okay, what do I really need a CPA for?"
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.520]   This is a great example.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.040]   Getting that one number correct is so important.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.160]   - Yes, and just to be clear, I love this stuff
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.080]   and we've been talking about it for over an hour
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.240]   and I still looked at that spreadsheet and said,
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.200]   "I am so glad someone else was preparing this for me."
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.200]   - And again, if people are curious,
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.160]   I mean, we, for instance, are releasing online resources
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.960]   to self-calculate it just so people are curious.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.840]   But the idea is just like, use this as a guide,
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.480]   have a professional actually run the numbers.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.360]   You don't want to do it yourself.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.520]   - But we talked about S-Corps
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.760]   and this is a decision I was making recently.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.120]   But one of the things is
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.080]   when you have self-employment income as a business owner,
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.000]   you are subject to pay your self-employment taxes
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.080]   entirely yourself.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.720]   And that's your social security, your Medicare,
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.440]   which your employer usually picks up half of.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.720]   And so the advantages of making sure you're electing
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:45.480]   for an S-Corp election are that you split your net income
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.920]   into salary and owner distribution.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:50.120]   And the salary is subject to those self-employment taxes,
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.440]   but the distribution isn't.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.320]   How important is that?
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.880]   How much savings could that be?
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.480]   - It depends a lot on how much you earn.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:59.080]   For me, $100,000 in net income
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.600]   is when it sort of enters no-brainer territory.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.880]   I know some CPAs or people will do it at 70, 80K,
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.200]   but to me, it goes back to return on hassle.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.000]   And an S-Corp is undoubtedly more hassle than an LLC
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.960]   and payroll costs, all of those,
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.640]   your CPA will charge a little bit more,
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.800]   could be maybe $1,000 a year.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.640]   So to me, $100,000 a year is the point
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.040]   at which it sort of makes sense.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.200]   And then as you get higher and higher,
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.560]   it just scales further up from there.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.720]   And that's $100,000 in net income.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.920]   The one caveat I should add,
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.400]   not relevant to most of the universe,
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.000]   but in our universe, very relevant,
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.320]   is New York City has a higher tax on S-Corps.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:41.160]   It's about 8.8%, so it wipes out a lot of savings.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:44.200]   So I know a few people that have listened to these podcasts
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.880]   in New York City, signed up for an S-Corp,
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.240]   and ended up with higher taxes.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.960]   So for New York City S-Corps, maybe chill,
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.520]   your thresholds are a little bit different,
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.720]   but for everyone else, about $100,000 in net income
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.360]   is where it makes sense.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.600]   - I ran the math on this.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.080]   This is actually the model I built with ChatGBT,
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.080]   but one other factor I never hear anyone mention
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.880]   is that by lowering your salary,
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.320]   you are reducing the amount
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.320]   of Social Security credits you earn.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.960]   So the way Social Security is calculated in the US
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.720]   is actually much more complicated than I thought,
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:17.640]   but it basically looks at your top 30 earning years,
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:19.920]   and you get credits for how often you've earned
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.760]   and how high you are in that peak.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.440]   I believe right now it's somewhere around like 190,000,
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.840]   but don't quote me on that number.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:29.760]   And so if you reduce your income to 100,000,
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.680]   you are going to get less Social Security benefits
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.360]   in retirement, if Social Security benefits.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.520]   TVD on the future of the entire program,
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.040]   but just know that that is one implication
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.880]   of pairing yourself a lower salary through an S-Corp
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.040]   is that you will earn lower Social Security benefit
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.040]   in retirement.
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.200]   However, I built an entire model
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.720]   to factor precisely this in,
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.360]   and at the end of the day,
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.800]   the savings you get if you turn and invest that
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.400]   and earn a modest return
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.320]   would outweigh the Delta of your Social Security benefit,
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.840]   unless you live to like 130 or 140,
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.480]   which there are people trying,
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.840]   but I'm not planning on.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.240]   - That's a breakeven point.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.480]   The other thing worth pointing out
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.360]   while you're on that topic
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.560]   is same with solo 401(k) contributions.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.400]   We'll talk a little bit about solo 401(k) soon,
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:16.600]   but that is limited by how much you pay yourself
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:17.760]   in W-2 as an S-Corp,
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.800]   which is another reason you wanna have someone
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.600]   find the perfect number for you.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.120]   - For me, the math was,
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.320]   if you pay yourself at least 66,000,
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.680]   you can through a combination
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.680]   of pre-tax employer contribution
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:33.200]   and after-tax mega backdoor Roth rollover,
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.640]   you can make sure you get that.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.240]   But if you don't pay yourself at least the threshold,
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.920]   there's not a way to max it out.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.760]   - Exactly.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.200]   - So that's S-Corp.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.160]   Another big thing
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.200]   and something that I think every non-business owner
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.120]   is always jealous of
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.560]   is business owners are walking around saying,
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.440]   "Oh, I got all these business expenses."
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.200]   Let's talk about some of your favorites.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.600]   - Yeah, so big, easy one, right?
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.600]   Let's imagine two people.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.560]   One is a W-2 employee that works from home.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.640]   The other person is a business owner that works from home.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:19:59.480]   Guess what?
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.320]   The business owner can deduct
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:03.000]   the pro rata square footage of their home office,
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.040]   which the W-2 employee
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.000]   who also uses their home office as much cannot.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.960]   So pro rata rent or mortgage can be deducted,
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.160]   which is pretty substantial, right?
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.560]   Like some people's home office,
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.400]   especially in New York,
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.040]   can be 15, 20% of their overall square footage.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:19.280]   You can deduct 15, 20% of rent, mortgage, utilities,
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.720]   cleaning, all kinds of miscellaneous things there.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.000]   I've also seen some homeowners
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.600]   actually rent their home to their company,
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:30.120]   potentially for a meeting or an offsite or whatever.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.120]   What you can do then
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.400]   is you can actually pay yourself rent from your company.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.400]   And if you do it for up to 14 days a year or less,
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.480]   pay no taxes on the gate.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.840]   14 days, you can rent your home
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.120]   even not to your business and pay no taxes.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.200]   But as a business owner,
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.040]   you also have the benefit
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.000]   of money from one hand into another.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.440]   - And one thing that I learned from my accounting firm
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.160]   is that you do not have to use square footage
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.480]   as the calculator.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.680]   So I looked it up and it said-
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.560]   - There's two methods, there's two methods.
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.560]   - There might even be more.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.080]   I read the code right before we got on.
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.400]   It said you can use square feet
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.480]   or any other reasonable method
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.320]   if it accurately figures your business percentage.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.400]   And the one that sometimes does a better job
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.800]   is percentage of rooms.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.680]   So if you have five rooms in your house
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.360]   and they're of roughly equal size,
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.880]   then it can be one fifth.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.680]   That's potentially a way
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.840]   that you could increase your home office deduction,
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.080]   especially if your home office
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.440]   is on the smaller side of the other rooms in your house.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.440]   It might give you a slight edge there.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.400]   - Yeah, and outside of that,
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.520]   you can deduct all the other things
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.280]   that you need to run your business,
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.920]   like phone, internet, conferences,
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.000]   travel to and from conferences, software.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.520]   One of the things we always saw at my last company
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.240]   is towards the end of the year,
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.240]   a lot of business owners would email us
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.200]   and ask us if they could buy annual plans
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.440]   and pre-pay for the next year,
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.240]   or sometimes more, the software,
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.400]   because they could then pre-buy it,
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.520]   reduce their taxable income for the year
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.880]   while pre-paying their expenses for the next year.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:59.720]   So as a business owner, you can deduct all these things
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:02.760]   to the degree I actually have some people
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.880]   that have either expensive hobbies
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.280]   or things they're interested in
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.840]   now conspiring to start businesses around it,
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.960]   because then those things
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.400]   can start becoming tax-deductible.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.680]   Like I have a friend who's a travel blogger
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.760]   who can write off all his trips
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.600]   because he legitimately makes money
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.560]   by teaching other people how to travel and things like that.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.840]   - A few other fun things, health insurance.
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.080]   If you provide health insurance for your family,
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.600]   that's a business expense.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.040]   And then because we like credit card points on all the hacks,
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.920]   if it's related to your business,
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.640]   the annual fees on those credit cards
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.480]   is a fair business expense.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.960]   And then deducted from your business income
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.560]   can be the employer contributions, correct?
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.840]   Any employer contributions to your retirement account.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.760]   - Yeah, I mean, basically you can choose
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.320]   whether to make them pre-tax or post-tax,
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.160]   but both employer and employee contributions
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.280]   can be pre-tax if you choose.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:55.280]   - And then you said the pre-paid expenses for next year.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.520]   I would even go as far as to say
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.680]   there are some companies where if you reached out
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:00.840]   and said, hey, we've all seen those calculators
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.240]   buying something online that say,
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.880]   here's the monthly price, here's the annual price.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.600]   As an individual, it's like,
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:07.840]   maybe you do it for the savings,
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:08.880]   but as a business, you could do it
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.720]   for the savings and the deduction.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.200]   - And one way of looking at it is like, okay, cool.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.920]   I can pay for this with my business
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.240]   and this is a business expense and I save money there.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.880]   Another way of thinking about this is, wow,
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.720]   you can now choose the best benefits in the game.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:25.160]   You can kind of pick the exact health insurance you want.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:28.240]   You can customize the best retirement plan you want.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.360]   You can pick and choose like literally
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.240]   and set everything up just the way you want to,
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.480]   which I also think is a really cool benefit
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.280]   that you wouldn't have at a corporation
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.720]   where you have to pick their retirement plan,
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.400]   their health plans, and all of that.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:41.960]   And a lot of cases, often the same for your family.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.920]   - Exactly, and so just to clarify so everyone knows,
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.280]   Ankur, you didn't pay me to do this episode, right?
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.920]   Like this is not an ad for Carry that you guys said,
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:50.920]   hey, we'll give you some money
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.360]   if you do an episode about taxes, right?
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.200]   - No, absolutely.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.120]   I mean, it's a match made in heaven,
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.480]   but the fact is you've been using the platform now
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.720]   for a bit and it's been great to onboard you there.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.360]   But yeah, I started this company
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:05.360]   because I was trying to set up a solo 401k,
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.680]   which in my opinion is the best retirement plan in America.
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.640]   And I honestly wanted to find a good provider
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.560]   and they all kind of sucked.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.840]   And we had to then build a platform,
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.440]   but that was not the goal.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.600]   It just sort of happened after searching the internet
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.520]   high and wide for something that did exactly
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.640]   what we wanted it to.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.440]   Couldn't find it, so built it ourselves.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.480]   - So the reason I clarified that is 'cause I will share,
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.880]   like I had actually opened up a solo 401k
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.160]   with another provider.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.480]   I'd paid them the fee to set it all up.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.840]   And they sent me like all these documents.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.560]   I had to go to a fidelity office,
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.200]   like an actual branch with papers.
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.560]   We got it all opened up.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.240]   And right before I funded it,
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.200]   I got connected with Cary and I was like,
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.040]   "Whoa, this is exactly what I was looking for."
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.280]   I never ended up getting them to give me back
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:47.520]   any of the funds for starting up,
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.040]   but I did open a Cary account.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.680]   I've now since rolled all of the 401ks
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.080]   that my wife Amy and I have had at Google
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.040]   and other employers into my Cary 401k.
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.240]   And I think their product's great.
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.040]   Cary is not a sponsor of the podcast,
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.960]   though I will be hitting up Ankur for the indefinite future
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.760]   to try to see if we can make that happen.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.160]   But as a member of Cary, they have a bunch of content
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.040]   and you guys have been putting out all these workshops
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.240]   on tax savings for business owners,
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:16.120]   on even some stuff on credit card points
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.320]   and all kinds of stuff.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.680]   And when I saw all the content you were putting together,
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.760]   I was like, "Wow, I wanna do an episode on end of the year,
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.440]   kind of tax savings and everything.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.360]   Why not have you on?"
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.480]   So I'm really glad you've been putting out that content
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.960]   because I've appreciated it.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.400]   And I'll link to some of the things that people can watch
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.600]   and some of the workshops they can sign up for.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.000]   And we'll absolutely link to Cary.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.080]   I think if you use allthehacks.com/cary,
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.720]   there's a good deal on the pro plan right now,
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.920]   which gets you a handful more perks over the base plan.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:45.960]   But I don't know, I just really like the platform.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.560]   Like it's become my solo 401k,
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.200]   both for pre-tax, Roth, everything.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.040]   - Nope.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.880]   I mean, again, that makes us so happy to hear that, right?
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.040]   We've been working on this for a year
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.400]   and wanted to build something
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.960]   that like kind of leveled up the game.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.480]   I mean, if you had actually gone through
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:01.520]   with the Fidelity plan, I don't know if you realize
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.240]   they would want you to deposit paper checks still
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.080]   for whatever reason.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:09.000]   - I literally have three paper checks from Fidelity
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   in my hand right now, three checkbooks they sent me
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.680]   because they were like, if you want to do anything,
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:14.800]   here's how you do it.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.880]   And it was just so ridiculous.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.200]   - Yeah, it's super old school.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.480]   In terms of the content and education, frankly, look,
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.160]   I've been learning this stuff myself
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.080]   over the last year, 18 months and teaching it, sharing it,
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.680]   coming on this podcast, talking about it
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.960]   is kind of reinforcing my learning as well.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.720]   So it's been cool to be able to like learn this.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:33.920]   And every once in a while,
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.200]   I'll read about something in the tax code
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.720]   and I'll either like tweet it or something like,
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:37.960]   wow, do you know it works this way?
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.240]   And it's honestly just been great for me
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.920]   and a bunch of people to like get smart about these things
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.480]   and get educated.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.840]   - Well, in the spirit of learning,
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.200]   I've got one more really cool thing
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.760]   that we didn't talk about related to QSBS
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.440]   that you may or may not know.
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.760]   But again, if anyone's interested,
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.240]   they can find everything you guys are doing on the website,
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:59.840]   which I will redirect to a special deal
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:03.040]   at allthehacks.com/carry, C-A-R-R-Y.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.400]   But on QSBS, which was the last thing
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.600]   on this talking point list I had,
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.560]   we already talked about it as an investor.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:12.080]   You briefly touched on it as a business owner.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.800]   But the thing that you didn't mention
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:18.400]   is that you get the greater of $10 million
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.800]   or 10X your investment.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.160]   And that rarely comes into play for most people
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:27.480]   because 10 times the investment to beat 10 million,
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.000]   you'd have to put a million in.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.880]   Very rarely is an individual investing a million dollars
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.120]   in a company that isn't already past
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:36.920]   that $50 million of asset level.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.800]   So it's not often talked that way.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.400]   But as a business owner,
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.000]   the ultimate strategy is to start an LLC,
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.840]   assign all of your IP to that LLC,
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:51.120]   and then at the point that you end up raising money
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.600]   and converting to a C-Corp,
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:55.280]   which is, as you said earlier, absolutely a requirement,
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:59.560]   if that happens at a point where that value of the stock
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:02.280]   from the LLC is worth,
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.800]   let's say as close to $50 million as possible,
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.560]   but definitely under.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.640]   Price is right for olds, right?
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.840]   You don't want to go over.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.400]   You do not want to go over.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:15.040]   Then your cost basis of your investment,
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.640]   which you contributed not as dollars from your bank account,
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.400]   but as shares in your LLC becomes the cost basis.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.800]   So it's possible to get right under 50 million
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.040]   if you owned the company outright yourself,
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.240]   which means that you would actually get
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.760]   $500 million tax-free.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.280]   Or if you and your co-founder were able to do this
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.120]   and split it up,
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.640]   you could see how that would go higher
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.080]   or if someone else in your family had those shares.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.680]   So that would mean that it is possible to use QSBS
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:48.680]   to get a tax-free $500 million or slightly under.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:49.920]   Yep, it's crazy.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.400]   I mean, the things to be careful of there
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.600]   is you don't want to go over 50 at all.
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:56.960]   So if it means 40, 45, that's totally fine.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.520]   You also have to be relatively confident in a good exit
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.160]   because the benefit would only kick in
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.520]   after your cost basis.
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520]   So if you actually end up selling the company
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:05.920]   for $50 million,
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.080]   you actually won't get any QSBS benefit at all.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.320]   So you have to be pretty confident
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:11.560]   and the company is going to do really, really well.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.680]   I highlight it not as the strategy
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.760]   that might make the most sense for everyone,
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.880]   but that there is a way to get right up close.
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.560]   If you play your cards right,
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.280]   this particular tax benefit
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.320]   could generate half a billion dollars of tax gains
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:29.160]   or slightly under 'cause it's 10 times a number
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.680]   that has to be less than 50,
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.840]   but it's pretty wild what the tax code can do
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.760]   if you just understand it.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.680]   And I'm really appreciative of you being here
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.800]   to help me explain a bunch of these things to people
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.120]   so that they can take advantage of it
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.800]   and not be in the vast majority of people
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.280]   who don't learn these things
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.840]   because we haven't grown up millionaire
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:51.760]   who've had access to all of these resources our whole lives.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:52.600]   - No, absolutely.
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:53.640]   Look, that's the mission, right?
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.120]   I'm a first generation immigrant here.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.400]   I learned about all this literally while selling my company
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.320]   and I'm like, wow, there is so much stuff here.
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.480]   We need to make this available and accessible to everyone
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.040]   or at least the people who care enough
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.320]   to kind of read and follow this.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.600]   So yeah, thanks for having me.
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.840]   It's been a blast.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:08.080]   - Yeah, thanks for joining.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.640]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.920]   If you couldn't tell from my voice,
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.360]   I was so excited to be doing this episode.
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:15.960]   I love thinking about ways to optimize taxes
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.320]   and I'm so glad Ankur was able to join us.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.440]   I really hope you found some practical and tactical ways
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.640]   that you can apply this to your own life
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.680]   and your own tax situation.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.040]   So thank you so much for joining me.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.400]   If there's one final favor I have for anyone
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.640]   during the holiday season,
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:34.120]   if you wanna go ahead and leave us a five-star rating
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.680]   and review in either the Apple Podcasts app or Spotify,
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.720]   it would be so awesome.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.240]   I really appreciate it.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:43.120]   Other than that, thank you so much for joining and listening.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.400]   I will see you next week.
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:47.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.800]   (birds chirping)
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.540]   (birds chirping)
