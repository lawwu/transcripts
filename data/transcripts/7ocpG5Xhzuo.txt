[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.880]   Jonathan, welcome to the Bogleheads on Investing podcast.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.880]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   Hey, John.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   It's great to be with you.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.360]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.200]   Let's start with your new book.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.680]   Tell us about your new book.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.920]   I have this new book out called My Money Journey.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's a collection of 30 essays written by various people who have in the past written
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.240]   for this website that I've run for the last six and a half years, humbledollar.com.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.360]   One of the specialties of the site is people talking about their own finances.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.200]   A lot of the writers for the site are essentially people who are keenly interested in personal
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.240]   finance, but they wouldn't necessarily be considered financial experts.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.120]   So what I say to them is, you may not be an expert on the financial world, but you are
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.580]   an expert on your own life.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.520]   So if you write about your own life and the financial experiences you have, you can do
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.400]   so with authority.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.600]   So against that backdrop, when it was suggested that we do a book, I said, "Well, okay.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.480]   Let's all write about our financial lives," and that's what the book is all about.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.540]   It's 30 people talking about how they've reached financial freedom or how they're endeavoring
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.080]   to reach financial freedom.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.680]   I think it's a unique book in this regard.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.080]   Most of the time, we don't talk honestly about money.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   People will tell you about their religious beliefs.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.640]   They'll tell you about their political beliefs.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.320]   They'll even tell you about their sex lives, but they will not tell you how much they're
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.280]   worth or how much they earn.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.360]   One of the things you'll find in My Money Journey is that people are brutally honest
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.180]   about their own finances.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.440]   People do talk about how much they earn.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.800]   They do talk about how much they're worth, and I think it's refreshing for people.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.120]   In a sense, it's also inspiring, but a lot of people struggle with their financial lives.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.520]   They worry whether they're on track or not, and what you'll see from the book is that
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.840]   people make financial mistakes, and yet they can still achieve financial freedom.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.040]   Well, why don't you tell us a little bit about your money journey?
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.440]   So among the 30 essays, one of them is My Money Journey.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.920]   It's about how I got to where I am today, which is 60 years old and semi-retired.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.040]   And when I look back on my financial journey, it really seems to be a story in two parts.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:57.480]   The first two decades or so was one of being super frugal and very much in a routine, striving
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.920]   towards financial independence.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.240]   And the period since has been one of a lot of turmoil in my life where I've tried my
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.600]   hand at a variety of things, in part because I could afford to do so, thanks to the financial
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.520]   freedom that came from my earlier frugality.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   But it was that earlier frugality that built the financial base that I rest on today.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.920]   So during those 20 years or so, it was a time when I was at the Wall Street Journal, writing
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.560]   my personal finance column, living out in the New Jersey suburbs, living in a house
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.940]   that was really far less expensive than I could afford.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.380]   And because that house was so much cheaper than I could really afford, it allowed me
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.200]   to save great gobs of money.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.680]   And like so many other people who reach financial freedom, it wasn't about being a smart investor
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.960]   that got me there.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.160]   It was about being a great saver.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.000]   It was about being the sort of person we refer to as a fire person today, financial independence
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.080]   retire early, except it was before the fire and ocean even existed.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.800]   It was just being super frugal and saving great gobs of money every month.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.480]   Frank Curzio: Anything else you'd like to share about your new book?
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.360]   Will Barron: One of the things that people who read the book will discover is not only
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.800]   is frugality a common theme, but the other thing that really jumps out is the influence
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.160]   of people's upbringing.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.520]   So many people talk about the influence of their upbringing on their financial habits.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.680]   If you're a parent, this is truly scary.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.840]   When you as a mother or father talk to your kids about almost anything, it's like you're
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.480]   holding a megaphone to their ear.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.920]   They hear everything at 10 times the volume they hear anything else that they hear during
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.040]   their lives.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.380]   And so some of the people in the book talk about how they struggle to overcome the money
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.000]   messages that they got from their parents.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.040]   Others talk about how those money messages really set them on the right course.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.740]   But either way, whether you're reacting to what your parents said or you're following
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.040]   what your parents said, the parental influence is really enormous.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.540]   And you see that in so many of the essays in the book.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.160]   Certainly as a relatively new parent, that gives me pause, but my wife and I think we've
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.160]   got relatively frugal disposition, so it's probably a good thing for future of our daughter.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.640]   Say this to you, John, yes, being frugal and teaching your kids to delay gratification
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.880]   is a great thing, but you can overdo it.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.000]   One of the stories that I've been telling lately is about my two kids.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.240]   I have a 34-year-old and a 30-year-old.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:36.800]   And my 30-year-old just got his PhD, seven years living on a stipend of $30,000 a year.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.460]   He spent much of those seven years living abroad, doing a lot of traveling and so on.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:49.480]   So over the seven years, he got, roughly speaking, $210,000 in the stipends.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.560]   And he managed to save something in the six figures.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.200]   When Henry told me this, it's like, "Whoa, maybe I emphasized the frugality a little
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.680]   too much."
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.720]   Maybe he would have enjoyed the seven years somewhat more if he'd been a little bit more
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.040]   carefree with the stipends that he got every year.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.800]   Yeah, it's certainly possible that on the same side of the coin going forward right
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.760]   now, he'll have a lot more freedom and flexibility to do what he wants, right?
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.480]   Similar to your own journey.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.480]   That's true, but still, I would say in terms of my own financial journey, when I look back
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.600]   at that initial 20-year period where I was living out in the Jersey suburbs in a house
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.220]   that was smaller than I could afford, in which I didn't really like that much when I held
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.040]   the purse strings very, very tightly.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.360]   In retrospect, I probably would have enjoyed those years more if I had been a little freer
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   in my spending.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.280]   Now, in my defense, we don't know until the end of the financial journey how it's going
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   to turn out.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.840]   In retrospect, my financial journey has turned out very well, but when you're starting out,
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.280]   you don't know whether you're going to get hit with frequent bouts of unemployment.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.040]   You don't know whether you're going to have problems with medical costs.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.960]   You don't know what sort of family turmoil you're going to face and so on.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   I had some of that, but not to a huge degree.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.680]   And so as a consequence, I ended up saving far more than I needed to for retirement.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.400]   But for others, even if they're diligent from the get-go, if they get hit with financial
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:19.360]   setbacks in one way, it's kind of another, maybe despite their frugality, they'll only
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.640]   just make it to retirement with the sort of money that they want.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.480]   I can't help but think of a quote by Morgan Household, "Save for no reason."
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.240]   And I think it's fine to save for no reason.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.640]   When I think about what it takes to have a happy financial life, I think there are three
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:41.440]   pillars and one of the key pillars of a happy financial life is not having to worry about
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.440]   money.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.520]   If you are diligent about saving and you know that if bad things happen in your life, you
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.680]   won't be wracked with financial anxiety, that is a huge source of happiness.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:58.400]   I say to people this all the time, money may not buy happiness, but not having money can
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.180]   buy you unhappiness.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.080]   So money takes away that anxiety and that's huge.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:11.040]   Until you've lived with too little money, you don't realize how great it is to have
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.080]   a bank account that's relatively full.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.120]   Jonathan, anything else you'd like to share about your new book?
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.080]   One of the things that comes through in the book as well, and this is maybe not a huge
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.560]   surprise, but one of the things that comes through in the book is that even if people
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:31.080]   try all kinds of different investment strategies early on, almost all of them ended up as indexes
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.460]   in the end.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:39.040]   So many people early on made financial mistakes, they dabbled in individual stocks, they dabbled
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.080]   in options, they thought they knew which way the market was headed and gauged in a little
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.800]   market timing, but eventually they settled down, become financial adults and started
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   indexing.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.480]   And that coupled with the frugality and the great savings habits is what allowed them
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.360]   to reach financial freedom.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:02.900]   It's so hard as investors to stay on track amid all the noise, all the temptations based
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:08.600]   on this market pundit's prediction or this person's screaming about this great individual
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.080]   stock or this hot, aptly managed fund, all these distractions that can lead you to derail
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.520]   your financial life.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:22.040]   But if you can ignore that, if you can do the right thing, which is save diligently,
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.560]   put it into a diversified portfolio of index funds and keep it up for 20 or 30 years, good
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.080]   things will happen.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.920]   I think about how Rick Ferry describes the investor's journey, which is born into darkness
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.720]   and then you find index funds.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   It's true.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:42.480]   There is much more to managing a financial life than saving an index fund, but certainly
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.080]   on the portfolio side of things, those are two key components.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.960]   I mean, obviously there's much more that you need to worry about, insurance, estate
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.280]   planning, find the right home, thinking about when to claim social security and so on.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:04.120]   But on the investing side, between good savings habits and index funds, those two together
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.120]   are magic.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.720]   Let's jump to some questions from the Bogleheads community.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.760]   This question from Lifsoft from the Bogleheads forums writes, "One thing I've often wondered
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:22.080]   about is why people like Mr. Clements himself are still working and not off backpacking
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.080]   somewhere."
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.080]   I looked through the questions on the Bogleheads forum and that one jumped out at me.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:35.320]   I would say, when it comes to retirement, there are two different things that you have
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.120]   to say, "I have enough of."
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.600]   One is the obvious question, which is, "I have enough money," but the other question
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.200]   you have to answer yourself is, "Have I done enough?
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.320]   Have I done enough with my career?
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.840]   Have I done enough for the world?
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.920]   Have I had enough accomplishments?"
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.880]   And I think for a lot of people, even if they decide that they want to quit the workforce,
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.880]   they are not done doing, there is so much more they want to continue to do.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.800]   And that is part and parcel, in my mind, to a fulfilling retirement.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.080]   You need that sense of purpose after you leave the workforce.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:18.800]   So for those who continue to work for money or who leave the workforce but continue to
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.360]   work hard at volunteer jobs, these are people who have said, "I haven't done enough for
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.360]   the world yet.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.800]   I need to continue to do things that I think are important, that I'm passionate about,
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.540]   that I find challenging, that I think I'm good at."
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.540]   And I think that's a wonderful thing.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.120]   I mean, we as humans are not wired to rest and relax.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.560]   We humans are wired to strive.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.760]   We are the great, great, great, great grandchildren of our hunter-gatherer ancestors.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.800]   They didn't sit around thinking, "Hey, let's take the day off and we'll see whether there's
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.180]   enough food tomorrow."
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:57.840]   They survived because they strove relentlessly to secure a shelter and secure more food.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.000]   And we, within us, carry those instincts.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.480]   We want to continue to strive.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.400]   And it's a great source of happiness.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.360]   So when I was talking earlier about having enough money being one of the pillars of financial
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.320]   happiness, knowing that things are going to be okay, even if bad times strike.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.040]   So the second pillar is being able to spend your days doing what you love.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.280]   And what we tend to love doing is things that give us a sense of purpose.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.600]   One thing I think about is a little meme that Rick Ferry often shares often on Twitter,
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:33.920]   which is "Financial Independents Remain Employed" for that FIRE acronym.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.200]   That's cute.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.560]   Let's jump to another question from the Boglatz community.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.320]   This one is from a user named GreatToBeOutdoors from the Boglatz forums, who writes, "Why
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.880]   aren't books that are written about personal finance and financial independence required
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.520]   reading in an academic setting at an early enough age to make a real difference?"
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.040]   I think it's unfortunate that that's not the case, but I'm not convinced that it would
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.600]   make a huge amount of difference.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:05.080]   I know there's a big push right now to teach personal finance more heavily at the high
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.280]   school level, at the college level, and so on.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.480]   But studies suggest that even if you teach people about personal finance, it doesn't
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.840]   stick for very long.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.800]   Instead, what tends to work is just-in-time education.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:25.080]   When you go to allocate the 401(k), you're given a sort of catch-up course on how to
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   invest sensibly.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:31.120]   Or when you go to get the mortgage, you have a catch-up tutorial on what's involved in
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.720]   getting a mortgage, and how much this is going to cost you, and what the risks and different
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.920]   types of mortgages are, and so on.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.360]   So I think even if we had a huge effort to teach personal finance at the high school
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.920]   and college level, probably for 80% of the people who take those courses, it will go
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.880]   in one ear and out the other, and it won't make a difference to the financial decisions
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.240]   they make two or three years down the road.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:16:00.960]   Instead, to influence them, they need education at that moment when they're making those decisions.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:09.400]   Let's jump to a question from Jordan from Twitter asks, "I've been reading a lot lately
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:16.160]   about what the Bogleheads say about SPIAs, and that is Single Premium Immediate Annuities.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.840]   And for those who aren't investing nerds, that just means we give the insurance company
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.800]   a big pot of money, and then they give us a monthly payment for life.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.140]   So that's a SPIA.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:31.320]   And then also TIPS ladders for guaranteed income when in a drawdown phase in retirement.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.480]   And again, for those who aren't investing nerds, TIPS ladder is just going to be a series
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:41.600]   of U.S. government bonds that mature over time that provides income for us to live in
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   retirement."
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.880]   Jordan goes on to say, "It seems to be either a love-hate kind of thing for those subjects.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.480]   Are there a place for these SPIAs or TIPS in retirement?"
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.040]   And so my answer to that is yes, absolutely, though we are talking about two completely
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.040]   different animals.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:04.760]   I mean, building a TIPS ladder could cover 30 years of retirement costs and with a pretty
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.400]   much guaranteed stream of income, Alan Roth has done an excellent analysis on this that
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.080]   it's got a reasonable amount of publicity.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.840]   The problem is, what if you live longer than those 30 years?
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   And that's what you get with the Immediate Fixed Annuity.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.440]   You get this stream of income that will last as long as you do.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:29.880]   And for years, for years, I've talked about Immediate Fixed Annuities, how they are different
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.720]   from other annuities, how they are not this evil insurance product.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.440]   I think I may have made two converts over the years.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.300]   I mean, it's just been such a hard sell.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.840]   It's not like insurance agents are cheering for people to buy these products.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:50.360]   With a Immediate Fixed Annuity, the insurance agent's commission might be 1%.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.080]   They are not out there pushing it because they don't make very much money from selling
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   Immediate Fixed Annuities.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.960]   In fact, there's almost nobody out there who seems to want people to buy Immediate Fixed
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.920]   Annuities, except for me.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:07.080]   And the reason I think they're great is that one of the biggest risks in retirement, maybe
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.800]   the biggest risk, is outliving your money.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.840]   There are only a few ways to hedge that risk.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.840]   The number one way is to delay Social Security till age 70.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.120]   That's what I plan to do.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.880]   And anybody who's in reasonably good health, I'd encourage them to do that as well.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.760]   That'll give you the best annuity you can buy, this inflation-adjusted stream of income
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.000]   backed by the government, and it's at least partially tax-free.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.200]   But if that alone is not going to comfortably cover much of your retirement expenses, I
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.720]   think there's a good case to be made for buying an Immediate Fixed Annuity.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.480]   And I'm certainly planning to do that.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.240]   I'm not fully retired yet, but when I reach the point when I do, I'm certainly going to
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.760]   think about putting at least a portion of my portfolio into an Immediate Fixed Annuity,
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.600]   probably with an eye to at least covering my fixed living costs.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.880]   With that SPIA, that Single Premium Immediate Annuity, I'm going to give this insurance
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.920]   company a big pot of money, and then they're going to give me an income stream for life.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.600]   It is the right way to think about insurance, and it's a great way to manage that longevity
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.280]   risk, the risk that we're going to live longer than maybe our assets would provide if we
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.680]   invested in a stock and bond portfolio.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.480]   A lot of folks are worried about inflation.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.000]   With that approach, hey, this payment, it's not going to increase for inflation.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.160]   Fortunately, there is research that we even talked about on the last episode of the Bogleheads
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   on Investing podcast, where retiree spending decreases on a real level over the years.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.480]   And that's just an early way of saying, after inflation, we're still spending less in retirement.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.280]   One of the things that I mentioned to people often is you happily stay with your employer
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.240]   for 20 or 30 years to get this traditional pension.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.280]   You're willing to make that sacrifice, and yet come retirement age, you're not willing
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:55.120]   to take $100,000 or $200,000 out of your portfolio and use it to buy the same income stream.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.000]   So you're willing to sacrifice 20 or 30 years out of your career to get a pension, but you're
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.720]   not willing to sacrifice money out of your nest egg to get the same thing.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.600]   It doesn't make any logical sense.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.520]   And then also, and I see this a lot when working with folks, there's going to be the financial
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.440]   nerd of the family, and then we're going to have the more normal spouse.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:20.280]   So we want to think about, "Hey, what sort of investment plan are we setting up in that
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.640]   worst case?"
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.080]   For those households out there where we have the financial nerd of the family, and then
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:30.200]   the more normal person, what happens when that financial nerd isn't able to manage that
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.140]   household finances anymore?
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.240]   That SPIA is pretty great.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.200]   That money, it shows up into your checking account every month.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.360]   It is zero maintenance.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:44.360]   So for our non-financial spouses, SPIA can also be a really great fit just for that reason.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.960]   And just to add onto that, which is even as you think about an immediate fixed annuity
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.920]   to provide that guaranteed lifetime stream of income that makes your financial life that
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.280]   much simpler, folks should also think about how else they should simplify their financial
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.560]   life as they approach retirement age.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.280]   So John, I don't think this is any great secret.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.680]   I think I'm substantially older than you.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.640]   I'm on the cusp of retirement and I'm thinking about ways that I can simplify my finances.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.240]   I obviously have no problem handling it now, but will that be the case 15, 20 years down
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   the road?
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:23.000]   So I'm striving to have fewer credit cards, fewer checking accounts, deal with fewer financial
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.720]   firms, and I'm also looking to simplify my mutual fund portfolio.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:34.000]   I have over the years owned sort of more specialized funds, small cap value, large value, stuff
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   like that.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.040]   I think that as the next decade continues, I will probably look to either ease out of
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.440]   those positions, perhaps eliminate them entirely, because at some point I'm not going to want
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.440]   to deal with it.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.760]   And I might not be capable of dealing with it.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.760]   Absolutely.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:56.200]   On Bogleheads Live episode 36, we had Mike Piper on speaking about one of his books,
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.640]   After the Death of Your Spouse, and that was a huge theme there as well.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.400]   Simplify, simplify, simplify, to quote Mike in that episode.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.360]   I'll link to that in the show notes for our listeners.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.360]   Mike made a similar point with respect to simplifying your investment portfolio.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.820]   I know that he personally uses one single mutual fund, a balance fund, roughly 80% stocks
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.980]   and 20% bonds, rebalances automatically.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.020]   Now he has all his money in tax advantaged accounts, so tax efficiency is a little bit
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.380]   less of an issue for him, but gosh, that makes it very easy.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.940]   Just one single mutual fund.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.480]   Everything is in that.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.480]   Set it and forget it.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.520]   You don't even have to think about it.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.360]   Let's jump to another question from the Bogleheads forums.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:47.080]   Username JPM writes, "The way of the Bogleheads, live below your means, seek safety and diversification
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.600]   rather than market timing, invest consistently and with taxes in mind, keep investing fees
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.120]   low, time is your friend so use it, avoid acting on impulse and emotion as they are
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.320]   your enemies.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:04.840]   Does he know of any comparably successful approaches for the non-financial professionals?"
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.720]   The short answer is no.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.160]   Those are the key components of a sensible portfolio.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.040]   We can quibble about the details, what should be your precise asset allocation, how should
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:23.080]   you diversify, how frequently should you rebalance and so on, but yeah, those are all the key
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.080]   components.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.000]   The other thing is, Jack Bogle and many other people have said investing may be simple and
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.560]   it should be simple, but it isn't easy.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:36.160]   The really tricky part is not only getting yourself to do it, but then staying the course
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   thereafter.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:42.880]   As we were mentioning earlier in the podcast, there are so many temptations to stray, but
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.100]   if you can resist those temptations to stray and continue to do the right thing decade
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:52.600]   over decade, and that is a great list that the writer included, good things will happen.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.440]   Certainly with respect to that broader financial planning approach, I'm going to 100% agree
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.440]   with you, Jonathan.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.100]   I can't think of anything similar.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:04.920]   And then with respect to the investing piece, one thing that makes low-cost index funds
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.900]   so great is not necessarily that we get to invest in the stock market, it's that we are
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:17.440]   able to invest in a diversified manner at low cost simply and easily.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:23.320]   I can't think of another way you can invest simply and easily at low cost that is also
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   diversified.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.600]   So, let's think about private equity.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.360]   Let's say you do private equity yourself.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.520]   That's going to keep your fees low, right?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.520]   You go out, you find companies, you invest in them, but the catch is it's really hard
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.780]   to be diversified that way.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.360]   You have to invest in hundreds of companies.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.920]   Meb Faber talks about this a lot, I'll link to some resources in the show notes where
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.920]   he does that.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:49.280]   He'll say, "Hey, private equity could make sense if you keep your fees low, but now that
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.760]   means you're doing it yourself, you're not using a money manager, and therefore getting
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.520]   diversification is quite hard."
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.040]   I believe Meb invests in perhaps 300 companies, so you've got to go out and you've got to
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.560]   look at more than 300 just to get the level of diversification he's gotten in his approach,
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.280]   and it's going to be the same thing for real estate.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.840]   You can invest in real estate directly, that's going to keep your fees low, there's no money
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   manager between you and your money, but now you've got to invest in a lot of properties,
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.520]   and that takes a lot of money because you can't buy just part of a property, you've
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.520]   got to buy the whole thing.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.600]   Now, certainly, there are private equity funds and there are real estate funds, and you can
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.960]   get diversification there, and they're passive as well, but you can't get low costs there.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.720]   Index funds are so fascinating because we can invest at low cost, be diversified, and
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.120]   it is a leave it alone approach.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.640]   I don't know of any other investment where you can do that.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.320]   Just picking up from that point, John, I had a chance to look through your request for
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.240]   questions on the Bogleheads, and one of the things that was put there was like, "What
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.000]   is Clemens' biggest financial mistake or biggest financial regret?"
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.760]   And gave that question a lot of thought, maybe it's particularly pertinent to me right now,
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.120]   so my biggest financial mistake or my biggest financial regret doesn't relate to my portfolio,
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.800]   I'm super diversified, I've tried to keep costs low, I've kept an eye on taxes, instead
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.380]   my regrets or my financial pain has all come from real estate.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:15.200]   I've owned four houses over the course of my lifetime.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.040]   One was a big success, and the other three have been, to use a technical phrase, royal
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.400]   pains in the ass.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:29.120]   And it is an illustration of why index funds are great, so many other ways of investing
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.880]   are awful, which is that this real estate is a big undiversified bet on a single piece
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.760]   of property, and when it goes well, it can go really well, and when it goes badly, it
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.320]   can be dreadful.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:48.400]   Right now, I'm in the middle of renovating the latest home that I bought, had it thoroughly
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:54.160]   inspected when I bought it, there was no sign of any major problem.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:00.520]   The kitchen was gutted about four weeks ago, it was the beginning of the remodeling project.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.640]   Your usual standard Philadelphia row home, and what the contractor discovered when they
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:12.320]   ripped out the kitchen and all the wallboard and so on, is that at the right-hand backside
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:18.960]   of the house, there is no load-bearing wall, no load-bearing wall, period.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:25.840]   So suddenly the cost of this renovation has gone up by 12 or 13% because they have to
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.400]   repour concrete floor and rebuild a wall to support the back right side of the house.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:37.160]   I, as a buyer of a home, who's typically ignorant, and even with the help of an inspector, had
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.640]   no idea, nor did the contractor, until they tore out that wall.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:47.040]   But that's the danger of making a big undiversified bet, and that is what real estate is.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.220]   Let's jump to another question.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:53.600]   This one is from Vogelfangau, who writes, "I've been a regular reader of Jonathan since
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.040]   his Wall Street Journal days and never missed his weekly Humble Dollar newsletter.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:03.000]   My question is, if he had the power to change one past column or piece of advice from his
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.960]   Wall Street Journal days, what would it be?"
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:14.360]   I would say that over the course of my journalistic career, there are three things that I regret.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.360]   One is in thinking about some past columns that I wrote, even though I avoided getting
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.480]   into the prediction business, I don't think anybody can predict what's going to happen
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.360]   to the markets in the short term.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:30.240]   I think the only reasonable assumption is that a globally diversified portfolio will
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.960]   go up over time, but that doesn't tell you anything about the short term.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.760]   Nonetheless, at various times, I feel like I wrote about different parts of the financial
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:44.720]   markets with more or less enthusiasm, because I imagined I knew something that was unknowable.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.920]   I may not have made a prediction in those columns, but the reason I wrote those columns
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:53.080]   was because, in my head, I thought I did know something.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.720]   And second, related to that, was I think that over the course of my career, I spent far
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:03.200]   too much time talking about stock market valuations.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:08.480]   And at this point, looking back over the past four decades, I have to say, and this sounds
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.860]   like a sort of completely butt-ignorant thing to say, but I have to say that at this point,
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.480]   I would have been much better off over the course of my career just ignoring all these
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:24.140]   stock market yardsticks, these valuation metrics, because they are not predictive.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:30.800]   Even if you know everything about the Shiller Ratio, P/Es on forecasted earnings, trailing
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:36.560]   earnings, book value, the Q Ratio, whatever it is, the Tobin's Q, it's not going to tell
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.120]   you where the market is going.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:44.080]   And yet, I spent way too much time writing about these things that, nothing more than
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.920]   intellectual noise.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.200]   I did a paper on dollar-cost averaging that looked at the question, "Hey, markets are
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   expensive.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.680]   Should I be dollar-cost averaging?"
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:58.640]   I did that paper in 2017 using 2016 data because people were concerned about market valuations
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.640]   then.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.440]   Can you imagine if you thought, "Hey, the market's expensive."
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.040]   Back in 2017 and didn't invest in stocks for that reason, you would have missed out a lot.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.540]   So I think one takeaway from that is, yes, markets are expensive, but that doesn't mean
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.880]   they can't continue to go on to be even more expensive.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.560]   - One of the basic asymmetries of the markets that's worth keeping in mind is that the most
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.600]   the stock market can lose is 100%.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.760]   Very few have ever managed to achieve that, except maybe the Russian market of late.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.000]   But the potential gains are unlimited.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.080]   You don't know how high the sky is.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.240]   So bailing out on the way up because you think the market is expensive can turn out to be
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.060]   a huge mistake.
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:46.240]   I've been writing about the financial markets since 1985.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:52.200]   And from the earliest days, the old-timers were saying, "Oh, this rally we're in, we
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.120]   could be going back to the 1970s anytime now."
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.960]   And then of course, the 1987 stock market crash came along to confirm that, yes, they
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.880]   were right to be fearful, and they've continued to be fearful ever since.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:12.060]   If I had listened to the old-timers decrying the sky-high valuations, I would never have
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:17.900]   owned stocks over the past four decades, because every year it looks unattractive and best
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.540]   based on valuations, and yet the market has continued to rise.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:26.740]   - I think about what is the worst case with respect to a globally diversified portfolio?
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:32.020]   That's to say, if the market does go to zero, then your portfolio is going to be the least
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.300]   of your concerns.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.940]   So it makes it hard for me to figure out a situation when it's ever the right reason
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:38.940]   to sell out.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.340]   Because if the global society does not collapse, then you want to stay invested.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.100]   And if it does collapse, then there's no real benefit to selling anyway.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.460]   Either of those situations, I can't ever think of a reason why it makes sense to sell if
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.700]   you have the right mix of stocks and bonds for you that matches your personal goals,
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.860]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.140]   - If the stock market went to zero, what do you imagine bonds are going to do?
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.480]   They're also going to zero.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:06.100]   We are facing economic apocalypse, and nobody will be able to make interest payments on
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.100]   their bonds.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:12.260]   At that point, probably the only thing that will save you are canned goods and ammunition.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.260]   Think about economic apocalypse, yeah.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.340]   Get out of everything.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.820]   But if you think that the economy will continue to grow, then stocks are the place to be.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.620]   And I do believe that to be a stock market investor, you need to be an optimist.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:31.520]   Every day, almost 8 billion people around the world wake up and say to themselves, "How
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.640]   can I make my life better?"
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:40.160]   And the human energy that is unleashed drives the growth of the economy, leads to improving
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.160]   productivity.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.080]   And we all benefit from that.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.640]   That is what trickles through to the stock market, and it's why the stock market rises
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.640]   over time.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.520]   And if you have any doubt about that, just think back to 2020 and the pandemic.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.600]   Faced with this economic shutdown, faced with this virus that we knew very little about,
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.520]   somehow people managed to go on.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.160]   Restaurants moved their tables out onto the street.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.800]   Companies figured out how to get employees to work from home.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:10.360]   The amount of innovation that occurred because of the pandemic was huge.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   And of course, the biggest innovation was the discovery of a way to vaccinate people.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:23.120]   We developed a vaccine in record time, extraordinary scientific achievement.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:29.560]   If you have any doubt about the stock market, think about that period and the human energy
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.000]   that was unleashed, and that should make you optimistic about the future.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.280]   And then the final thing I regret, I now have less enthusiasm for target date funds than
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.640]   I did 10, 20 years ago.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.720]   And it's simply because I'm at a different point in my life.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.400]   When I thought about target date funds initially, it's like, this is a great solution for people
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.680]   who are saving for retirement.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.020]   And I still believe that's the case.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.380]   If you're in a 401(k) plan and you're not sure what to do, putting all the money into
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.480]   a target date fund is a great solution.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.640]   Hopefully it'll be one of those ones that are built around index funds, kind of out
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.160]   of Vanguard or Fidelity or Schwab.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.600]   But even these funds that use actually managed funds, for probably the majority of investors,
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   are a better option than anything else they might get up to.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.860]   But as you approach retirement, which is where I am today, and I look at these products,
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.080]   they look much less attractive for a couple of reasons.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.620]   One is when you decide to sell, you're selling out of the entire fund.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:34.140]   You can't choose whether to throw money from the bond side or the stock side of the portfolio.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:39.640]   But the other thing that I find myself more critical of is the glide path of these funds.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:46.820]   I mean, they do become amazingly conservative as you get into retirement, down to 30% stocks.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:51.840]   And I don't think it's wise for somebody who is 75 years old to be a 30% stock.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.840]   Could be a lot of life ahead of you and a lot of inflation ahead of you.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.760]   I believe that you should have more in stocks in order to make sure that you have the portfolio
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.520]   that will carry you into your 90s.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.520]   The way target date funds are structured today, they just don't fit the bill.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.040]   So yeah, they're good for people early in their career.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.280]   I wish I'd been less enthusiastic about them and caution people more about the dangers
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.680]   as you approach retirement and get into retirement.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.560]   I 100% agree.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.400]   They are great on the way to retirement, but once you hit retirement, certainly you want
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.680]   to reevaluate them for precisely that reason.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.200]   It might make sense to even increase the amount you have in stocks once you hit that first
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.640]   day of retirement.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.480]   Wade found Michael Kitsis, they've done some work on this.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.720]   I'll link to that in the show notes for folks who want to check that out.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.320]   And certainly when you are looking for those target date funds, Vanguard has some great
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   low cost ones.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   Fidelity and Schwab, they actually have two varieties.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:50.600]   They do have a low cost index fund variety and they also have a higher fee active management
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   variety.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.460]   Most Bogleheads know which one is going to be the better fit for them.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.360]   This question is from username unwittinggulag from the Bogleheads forums.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:07.600]   To what extent is financial independence quantifiable, accumulating 25 times one's annual expenses
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:16.480]   or 50 times versus is it purely subjective being a feeling that one already has enough?
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:22.880]   So in terms of financial independence, you don't necessarily need 25 times your annual
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.140]   expenses because at least a portion of that is going to be covered by social security
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.400]   and you may also have a pension.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:36.080]   What you want as a rule of thumb is 25 times whatever you need in addition to the money
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.660]   that you're going to get from social security, from a pension, from any income annuities
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.380]   that you're the beneficiary of.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:46.120]   So yeah, as a rough rule of thumb, 25 times, not a bad guideline.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.760]   I would be happy with that.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.040]   And for those who aren't investing nerds, you might be wondering why 25 times?
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.960]   Well, because that gets you a 4% withdrawal rate.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   Why 4%?
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:03.360]   Well, that is the research that Bill Bengen created showing, hey, you could take 4% out
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:09.160]   of your retirement portfolio, adjust it for inflation each year and not run out of money
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.720]   after 30 years.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:15.960]   We interviewed Bill Bengen on episode 35 of the Bogleheads live show and we also interviewed
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.200]   Christine Benz on episode 37.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.680]   That takes a little bit of a different approach to answering that same question.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.720]   I'll link to all that in the show notes so folks can check that out.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:30.480]   So the Bengen research has been subject to some controversy over the years and people
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.720]   say, well, you can withdraw more than 4%, less than 4%.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.600]   You could follow a different method rather than stepping up every year with inflation.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.560]   But as a rule of thumb running up to retirement, I think it's as good as anything else out
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.560]   there.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.700]   And once you get into retirement, I think most people will probably do something somewhat
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.840]   different from Bengen's rule.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.920]   I mean, I find it hard to believe that there is a single sentient human being who will
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:59.560]   sit there and increase their portfolio withdrawals every year by the inflation rate, no matter
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.280]   what's going on in the financial world.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:07.620]   Nonetheless, as a basic rule of thumb, I think Bill Bengen's work is excellent.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:12.440]   And 25 times the income that you need over and above what you're getting from social
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.400]   security and other guaranteed income sources is a good rule of thumb.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.920]   Certainly to echo your point, Jonathan, is 4% the right answer?
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.080]   We can't know, but it is certainly a reasonable answer.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.280]   One thing that people who haven't been kicking around for as long as I have should know is
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.960]   that before Bill's research came along with suggestible withdrawal rates were all over
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   the map.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   6%, 8%.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.280]   I heard 10% was an okay withdrawal rate.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:46.000]   Bill with his research didn't at least introduce a note of sanity into this discussion.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.280]   Imagine retiring and trying to use a 10% withdrawal rate.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.200]   I don't know what this flavor of cat food these people were eating by their late seventies,
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.560]   but it must've been a pretty ugly retirement.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.560]   Absolutely.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:03.160]   And then I'll add no matter what medium you choose for making that spending approach to
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:08.800]   retirement, 4%, something less, something more, you always want to reevaluate it regularly.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.540]   That's going to be way more important keeping an eye on it, adjusting as needed than whatever
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.960]   initial plan you start out with.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.160]   I think it's one of the things with retirement is there's this end of history illusion that
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.000]   as of retirement, everything's going to be settled for the rest of your life.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.960]   And the fact is once you get into retirement, there will be constant upheaval just as there
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.520]   has been constant upheaval in your life up until that point.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.000]   And that means that not only will you have upheaval in the financial markets that will
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   make you rethink your financial strategy, you may find that whatever house you thought
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.980]   you were going to live in for the rest of your retirement is not going to be the house
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.160]   that's going to work for the longterm.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.720]   You may discover that you move for retirement, that wherever you ended up isn't the right
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.720]   place.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.240]   There are all kinds of decisions that you're going to revisit through your retirement years.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.060]   The world does not stop the day you stop getting a paycheck.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:03.120]   This question is from a user named Rad Audit from the Bullguards Forums who writes, "I
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.080]   believe it was Clements who related the story of when he was writing for a financial column
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:11.560]   in a newspaper, and he asked the question, 'Why don't we just tell them to invest in
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.120]   the S&P 500?'
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.320]   His editor said, 'Okay,' then asked, 'What are you going to write about next week?'"
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.520]   So actually that was not my story.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:25.240]   The time I heard that story was from Greg Spears, who actually writes for Humble Dollar
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.080]   and helps me with the editing of the site.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:32.960]   Greg used to work for Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and he traveled up to Valley Forge,
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:41.800]   met Jack Bogle, and wrote about the S&P 500 for Kiplinger's back in the mid-1990s.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.480]   He used the analogy that if investing is a 100-yard dash, buying an index fund is like
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.480]   starting on the 10-yard line.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.120]   You're just starting way ahead of everybody else.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.080]   And so he wrote this story, Kiplinger's ran it, then his editor said, "That's it.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.200]   That's your last index fund story, because if we ran that story every month, nobody would
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.120]   ever buy the magazine again."
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.000]   So Greg went on to work for Vanguard.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.240]   He worked there as a senior writer and editor for a few decades until his recent retirement.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:17.920]   My story about indexing, or my joke, is always that there are only 20 personal finance stories,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.940]   which means that by the time I left the journal and written 1,000 columns, I'd written each
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.840]   of those 20 stories 50 times each.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:30.000]   Now Jason Zweig, who I've known since the 1980s and I consider to be a good friend,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.080]   claims that he made that comment as well.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.880]   So we debate about who actually made the joke first, but essentially it's the same joke,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.960]   which is there's only so much sensible advice that you can give about personal finance.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:46.920]   As a writer about personal finance, you are reduced to trying to take this advice, which
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.880]   the earlier question talked about, living below your means, diversifying, keeping costs
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.760]   low and so on, and finding some way to make it sound fresh and interesting every week.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.600]   So yeah, everybody should own total market index funds.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.840]   It's great advice, but if you're going to say that regularly, you've got to find some
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.200]   new way to say it, or you're going to quickly be out of a job, and you'll probably bore
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.200]   your readers.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.360]   I think about that investing piece, and really it is simple.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:18.200]   There's not much more to it than get the right mix of low cost index funds, hold them forever.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:23.000]   There's so much more to financial planning that can be more complicated.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.080]   I wish I could figure out a way to get folks more interested in those other areas, making
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.760]   sure that they have the right insurance coverage, making sure they have their estate planning
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.760]   done.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.000]   Super boring compared to investing, at least for some folks.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:42.280]   Yeah, when I think about the financial world, I really think about it in three buckets.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:47.000]   So there is this investing piece, which we talk about endlessly.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.080]   People spend all day staring at CNBC, and it is information without insight.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:58.460]   I mean, there is no way that you are going to add anything to your portfolio's performance
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.960]   by taking in all of this useless information.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.060]   And then there are these two other parts that you can focus on.
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:11.520]   One is everything else, what I would call personal finance, estate planning, when to
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:16.040]   claim social security, insurance, buying the right size home.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:21.120]   All of these are areas where you can add so much more value than you can add by fiddling
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.800]   around with your portfolio.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.880]   And yet, these are the topics that barely get covered in the financial press, and certainly
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:34.040]   don't get covered on financial TV, but this is where you can add true value to your financial
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.040]   life.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:41.060]   And then the third bucket is really this whole area of money in the mind.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.460]   How do you use your money to have a happier financial life?
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.800]   What does money mean for you?
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.480]   What are you going to do with your money once you reach financial freedom that's going to
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.480]   give you this sense of purpose?
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.440]   This is a whole area that has only lately come onto people's radar screen, but I think
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.620]   it's such a rich area and there's so much to be learned and so much that we can add
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:07.800]   to our financial life by thinking about what money means to us and how we can use money
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.700]   as a tool to make our lives better.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:14.720]   Everybody should own total market index funds, be broadly diversified, save diligently, blah,
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.080]   blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.020]   But what are you going to do with all that money?
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:22.080]   How can you do it in a way that's going to enhance your life?
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.960]   Because that is what money is all about.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.600]   It's about having a better life, about having a happier financial life.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.560]   How are you going to take this nest egg that you've massed over your lifetime and make
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.600]   sure that you have a rich retirement that is filled with friends and family, that is
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.840]   devoted to things that you care deeply about?
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:46.040]   These are much more important questions than whether I should switch from this total market
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.280]   index fund to that total market index fund to save one basis point.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:55.120]   Jonathan, you're going to be attending the Bogleheads Conference this year.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.920]   This will be my fourth Bogleheads Conference.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.400]   And on the Saturday, there's an investing panel, so I'm going to be there.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.920]   And then on Sunday, Bill Bernstein and I are going to be in conversation, so I'm looking
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.920]   forward to that.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:13.400]   He's got a new edition of The Four Pillars of Investing coming out, and I wrote the foreword
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.400]   for that.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.320]   If people haven't read The Four Pillars of Investing or they want to see the latest version,
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.920]   I'd really encourage them to pick it up.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.760]   Bill did a complete makeover on that book, and it's a great read.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.760]   Absolutely.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.760]   It is a classic.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.920]   I'm certainly looking forward to reading the new version.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.520]   Jonathan, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.200]   Any final thoughts before I let you go?
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.880]   One of the things that I would encourage people who are a little further along in their financial
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:45.140]   journey, which I am at age 60, is to think about your portfolio and what you're going
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:51.160]   to leave behind because it becomes a question of what are you going to use during your lifetime
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.120]   and what are you going to end up bequeathing?
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:57.240]   In my case, I've reached this point where it's like, okay, everything that I have in
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.760]   my Roth accounts, I'm probably not going to spend during my lifetime.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:08.020]   So I'm going to invest this money for the benefit of my children, and as a consequence,
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.600]   the risk profile of those dollars is completely different.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.600]   I'm not going to be spending it during my lifetime, so that is 100% stock money, and
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.900]   because I don't want to worry about it, I've stuck it all in the Vanguard Total World Stock
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.220]   Index Fund.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:26.060]   I'm just going to let it ride between now and whenever I shuffle off this mortal coil.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.020]   So for those who are further along in their financial journey, I do think it's worth thinking
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.500]   about how much you're going to spend during your lifetime and what's going to be left
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.160]   over for others.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.980]   And once you've made that decision, I think an additional question you want to ask yourself
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:42.900]   is what do you want to give now and what do you want to give upon death?
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:46.180]   If you're going to give it to charity, I would encourage you to give it now.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:50.860]   You might as well see the benefit of your generosity today in your own lifetime.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.580]   With your children, it's a judgment call.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:56.900]   To the extent that you think you can give them money, it's not going to dent their financial
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:57.900]   ambition.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.500]   I think it's valuable to do.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:04.060]   I remember the financial stress I had in my 20s when I had absolutely no money, so you
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:08.760]   could actually make your kids' lives much better by giving them some money now.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.300]   But also, there's a trade-off.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.940]   You don't want to give them so much that you dent their financial ambition.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:19.060]   I know this is a sort of a first-world problem and maybe a first-world problem for people
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:22.540]   of relative affluence, but it is worth thinking about.
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:26.940]   It's certainly something that I think about a lot at this point in my life.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:27.940]   Thank you, Jonathan.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:31.460]   I know that we certainly touched on that topic with Mike Piper.
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.300]   He discusses a bit of that in his book, More Than Enough.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.540]   Hey, which generation should you give money to?
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.820]   Your children or grandchildren?
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:43.100]   Giving it to that younger generation might make a bigger impact.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:47.820]   Your children might already be financially set by the time you pass and leave them your
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:48.820]   assets.
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:53.140]   I know everybody's probably already got this message, but along with Bill Bernstein's book,
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.180]   Mike Piper's new book, More Than Enough is well worth reading.
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.180]   I thought it was excellent.
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:02.060]   Well, Jonathan, thank you again so much for joining us and look forward to seeing you
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:06.100]   at the Bogleheads conference later this year in October.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.940]   It was great to talk to you, Jon, and yeah, I look forward to seeing you and everybody
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.500]   else from the Bogleheads who's going to be there down in Bethesda.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.040]   And that wraps up our interview with Jonathan Clements.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:23.900]   Don't forget that there are still just a few slots remaining to register for the 2023 Bogleheads
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.020]   conference.
