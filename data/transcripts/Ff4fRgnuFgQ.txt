[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:34.420]   of
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.460]   go. I create,,,, anime
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:23.920]   So when there's tension in that inner circle of,, of close folks, so. When you trust those folks to help you make difficult decisions.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:52.880]   about, ,, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, the future of the company and the metaverse or the AI. , how do you build that close knit group of folks, , to make those difficult decisions? Is there people that, , you have to have critical voices, very different perspectives on, , focusing on the past versus the future, all that kind of stuff.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:52.880]   Yeah. I mean, I think for one thing, it's just spending a lot of time with whatever the group is that you want to be involved with.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:52.880]   Yeah. I mean, I think for one thing, it's just spending a lot of time with whatever the group is that you want to be involved with.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:52.880]   Yeah. I think for one thing, it's just spending a lot of time with whatever the group is that you want to be involved with.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:52.880]   Yeah. I mean, I think for one thing, it's just spending a lot of time with whatever the group is that you want to be involved with.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:21.840]  , grappling with all of the biggest challenges. And that requires a fair amount of openness. And, you know, I mean, a lot of how I run the company is, you know, it's like every Monday morning, we get our, it's about the top 30 people together. And we, and this is a group that just work together for a long period of time. And I mean, people, people rotate in, I mean, new people join, people leave the company, people go do other roles in the company. So it's not the same group over time, but it's a lot of open space.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:27.580]   reminded
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:46.580]   remember successor
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:11:15.560]   my style is I'm probably more pressure and and yeah and and I'd probably rather be the top player but but I'm also smaller right I'm not I'm not like a heavyweight guy right so from that perspective I think like you know it's especially because you know if I'm doing a competition I'll compete with people who are my size but you know a lot of my friends are bigger than me so so back takes probably pretty important right because that's where you have the most leverage advantage.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   So that's where you have the most leverage advantage.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   So that's where you have the most leverage advantage.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   So that's where you have the most leverage advantage.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   So that's where you have the most leverage advantage.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   So that's where you have the most leverage advantage.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   So that's where you have the most leverage advantage.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   So that's where you have the most leverage advantage.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   So that's where you have the most leverage advantage.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:44.500]  , where where you know people you know their arms your arms are very weak behind you right so so being able to get to the back and take that pretty important but I don't know I feel like the right strategy is to not be too committed to any single submission but I said I don't like hurting people so so I always think that chokes are are somewhat more humane way to go than joint locks.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.500]   Yeah and it's more about control it's less dynamic so you're basically like a
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:45.500]   Yeah and it's more about control it's less dynamic so you're basically like a
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:45.500]   yeah and it's more about control it's less dynamic so you're basically like a
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:45.500]   and it's more about control it's less dynamic so you're basically a chokes are somewhat more humane way to go than joint locks.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:52.340]   So let's go yeah back take to a rear naked choke I think it's like the clean way to go.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:52.340]   So let's go yeah back take to a rear naked choke I think it's like the clean way to go.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.040]   Straightforward answer right there.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.040]   Straightforward answer right there.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.440]   Straightforward answer right there. What advice would you give to people looking to start learning jiu-jitsu?
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:11:59.440]   What advice would you give to people looking to start learning jiu-jitsu?
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:11:59.440]   What advice would you give to people looking to start learning jiu-jitsu? Given how busy you are given where you are in life that you're able to do this you're able to train you're able to compete and get to learn something from this interesting art.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:10.440]   Given how busy you are given where you are in life that you're able to do this you're able to train you're able to compete and get to learn something from this interesting art.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.440]   To learn something from this interesting art.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:39.580]  ,
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.380]   I really believe that like if you're going to accomplish whatever anything a lot of it is just
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:41.380]   I really believe that like if you're going to accomplish whatever anything a lot of it is just
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:41.380]   I really believe that like if you're going to accomplish whatever anything a lot of it is just

[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.120]   I really believe that like if you're going to accomplish whatever anything a lot of it is just being willing to push through
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.120]   being willing to push through
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.620]   being willing to push through right and having the grit and determination
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:45.620]   right and having the grit and determination
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.120]   right and having the grit and determination to push through difficult situations
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:49.120]   to push through difficult situations
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.820]   to push through difficult situations for a lot of people that
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:51.820]   for a lot of people that
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.520]   for a lot of people that that ends up being sort of a
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   that ends up being sort of a
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.320]   that ends up being sort of a difference maker between the people
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   difference maker between the people
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.820]   difference maker between the people who kind of get the most done
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:57.820]   who kind of get the most done
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.920]   who kind of get the most done and not I mean there's all these
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.320]   and not I mean there's all these questions about like
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.220]   and not I mean there's all these questions about like how many days people want to
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:27.160]   questions about like how many days people want to
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.260]   questions about like how many days people want to work and things like that I think almost
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:29.260]   work and things like that I think almost
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.460]   work and things like that I think almost all the people who like start
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:30.460]   all the people who like start
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.460]   all the people who like start successful companies or things like
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:31.460]   successful companies or things like that are just are working extremely
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:31.460]   successful companies are just are working extremely hard but I think one of the things that you learn this stuff very acutely run doing sports compared to running a company because running a company the cycle times are so long
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.800]   the cycle times are so long right think you start a project and then
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   right think you start a project and then
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   right think you start a project and then it's like months later or you know if you're
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   it's like months later or you know if you're
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.400]   it's like months later or you know if you're building hardware it could be years later
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   building hardware it could be years later
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.700]   building hardware it could be years later before you're actually getting feedback
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:42.700]   before you're actually getting feedback
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.600]   before you're actually getting feedback and able to you know make the next set of
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:44.600]   and able to you know make the next set of
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.000]   and able to you know make the next set of decisions for the next version of the
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   decisions for the next version of the
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.700]   decisions for the next version of the thing that you're doing whereas you one
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:47.700]   thing that you're doing whereas you one
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.000]   thing that you're doing whereas you one of the things I just think is mentally
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:14:17.240]   is mentally
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   is mentally so nice about these very high turn around
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   so nice about these very high turn around
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   so nice about these very high turn around conditioning sports things like that is you
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   conditioning sports things like that is you
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.940]   conditioning sports things like that is you get feedback very quickly right it's like okay
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:30.120]   as
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.060]   Because that's where the growth happens is being willing to be a beginner being willing to be embarrassed saying something stupid doing something stupid a lot of us to get good at one thing you want to show that off and it sucks.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:58.120]  iting
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.900]   and we're working on the follow-up models for this and thinking through how exactly this should work for follow-on now that we've had time to work on a lot more of the safety and the pieces around that.

[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:29.980]   and we've just done this with a lot of our infrastructure. So for people who don't know you did the limited release I think in February of this year of Llama and it got quote-unquote leaked meaning like it escaped the limited release aspect but it was you know that's something you probably anticipated given that it's just released to researchers. We shared it with researchers.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:25.900]  ::: I think it's been really neat to see. I mean there's been folks who are getting it to run on local devices right. So if you're an individual who just you know wants to experiment you know with this at home you probably don't have a large budget to get access to a device.
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:25.900]   It's really cool. I mean I think it's been really neat to see I mean there's been folks who are getting it to run on local devices right. So if you're an individual who just you know wants to experiment with this at home you probably don't have a large budget to get access to a device.
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:53.840]  :::: So getting it to run on your local laptop is pretty good and pretty relevant. And then there are things like Llama CPP reimplemented it more efficiently so now even when we run our own versions of it we can do it on way less compute and it's just way more efficient, save a lot of money for everyone who uses this. So that is good.

I think that at least for the stage that we're in now, the equities balance strongly, in my view, towards doing this more openly. I think if you've got something that was closer to super intelligence, then I think you'd have to discuss that more and think through that a lot more. And we haven't made a decision yet as to what we would do if we were in that position. But I don't think I think there's a good chance that we're pretty far off from that position. So so I'm not.

I mean, I guess that's going to be the that seems like an amazing product for businesses for humans.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:35.340]  , just not not just the assistant that's facing the individual, but the assistant that represents the individual to the public. Both of both directions. There's basically a layer that is the AI system through which you interact with the outside world with the outside world that has humans in it. That's really interesting. And you that have social networks that connect billions of people.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:41.380]   It seems like a heck of a large scale place to test some of this stuff out.
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:48.380]   Yeah. I mean, I think part of the reason why creators will want to do this is because they already have the communities on our services.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:55.180]   Yeah. And a lot of the interface for this stuff today are chat type interfaces.
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:03.380]   And between WhatsApp and Messenger, I think that those are just great, great ways to interact with people.
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:05.180]   So some of this is philosophy.
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:05.180]   But I think that's a great way to interact with people.

[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.940]   So I think that's a great way to interact with people. So you can imagine AI assistants
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:51.980]   So you can imagine AI assistants
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:53.660]   So you can imagine AI assistants that just do a better job of
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:53.700]   that just do a better job of
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:54.540]   that just do a better job of reminding you when it's your

[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:55.580]   reminding you when it's your friend's birthday and how you
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:55.660]   friend's birthday and how you
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:56.660]   friend's birthday and how you could celebrate them.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:56.700]   could celebrate them.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.380]   could celebrate them. Right now we have the little
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:53:58.420]   Right now we have the little
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.300]   Right now we have the little box in the corner of the website

[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:27.300]  , and it's a little box in the corner of the website that tells you whose
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:27.340]   that tells you whose
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.300]   that tells you whose birthday it is and stuff like that.

[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.300]   birthday it is and stuff like that. But at some level you don't just want
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:35.540]   And there are all these different flavors of
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:35.580]   And there are all these different flavors of

[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:37.620]   kind of personal AIs that I think could
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.340]   kind of personal AIs that I think could exist. So I think an assistant is
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:39.380]   exist. So I think an assistant is
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.460]   exist. So I think an assistant is sort of the kind of simplest one
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:41.500]   sort of the kind of simplest one
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:42.660]   sort of the kind of simplest one to wrap your head around.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:42.700]   to wrap your head around.
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:47.020]   to wrap your head around. But I think a mentor or a life

[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.940]   But I think a mentor or a life coach is someone who can give
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:48.980]   coach is someone who can give
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.020]   coach is someone who can give you advice, who's maybe like a
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:51.060]   you advice, who's maybe like a
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:55:15.220]   who's maybe like a cheerleader who can help pick you
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:15.220]   cheerleader who can help pick you
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.220]   cheerleader who can help pick you up through all the challenges that
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:17.260]   up through all the challenges that
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.220]   up through all the challenges that inevitably we all go through on a
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:19.220]   inevitably we all go through on a
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:21.060]   inevitably we all go through on a daily basis and that there's probably
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:21.060]   daily basis and that there's probably some role for something like that.
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:21.060]   daily basis and that there's probably some role for something like that. And then, I think it's part of the interesting innovation that's going to exist is that there are
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:21.180]   is that there are
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.820]   is that there are certainly a lot like education tutors.
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:24.940]   certainly a lot like education tutors.
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.900]   certainly a lot like education tutors. Right. It's like I just look at my kids
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:27.940]   Right. It's like I just look at my kids
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:30.980]   Right. It's like I just look at my kids learning to code and they love it.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:31.020]   learning to code and they love it.
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.700]   learning to code and they love it. But you know, it's like they get stuck
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:32.860]   But you know, it's like they get stuck
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:33.980]   But you know, it's like they get stuck on a question and they have to wait
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:34.020]   on a question and they have to wait
[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.260]   on a question and they have to wait till like I can help answer it.
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:36.260]   till like I can help answer it.
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.740]   till like I can help answer it. Right. Or someone else who they know
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:37.780]   Right. Or someone else who they know
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:55.420]   can help answer the question in the future.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:56.620]   can help answer the question in the future. So there will be like a coding assistant that they have that is like designed to be perfect for teaching a five and a seven year old how to code and and they'll just be able to ask questions all the time and, you know, be extremely patient. It's never going to get annoyed at them.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:56.620]   Right.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:56:03.260]   Right. I think that like there are all these different kind of relationships or functional relationships that we have in our lives that
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:03.420]   I think that like there are all these different kind of relationships or functional relationships that we have in our lives that
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.700]   I think that like there are really interesting.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.780]   I think that are really interesting. And I think one of the big questions is like, okay,

[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   We hear this all the time. A lot of creators on our services tell us that one of the most stressful things is to be able to communicate to the public, to the community.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:56.880]  , and they're like, they do their thing, right? And the creators, they're excellent at what they do, and they just want to connect with their community, but then they get really stressed. They go into their DMs and they see some brand wants to do something with them, and they don't quite know how to negotiate or how to push back respectfully.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:56.880]   So I think building a tool that can actually allow them to do that well is one of the things that we're doing.

More and more human like bots that are not necessarily trying to do a good thing or they might be explicitly trying to do a bad thing like phishing scams. Like social engineering all that kind of stuff. Which has always been a very difficult problem for social networks but now it's becoming almost a more and more difficult problem. Well there's a few different parts of this. So what's the most difficult part of this?

And I do think that as long as we can keep on putting more compute power against it, and if we're kind of one of the leaders in developing some of these AI models, I'm quite optimistic that we're going to be able to keep on pushing against the kind of normal categories of harm that you've been able to do.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   Yeah, I mean we have sort of this funny name for it, but we call it coordinated inauthentic behavior. Yeah, it's kind of incredible how a small collection of folks can create narratives.

[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:37.860]  , create stories, especially if they're viral, especially if they have an element that can catalyze the virality of the narrative.
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:38.860]   Yeah, I think there the question is you have to be very specific about what is bad about it, because I think a set of people coming together or organically bouncing ideas off each other and a narrative comes out of that is not necessarily a bad thing,
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:38.900]   but I think that's kind of interesting.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:46.300]   if it's kind of authentic and organic, that's like a lot of what happens and how culture gets created and how art gets created and a lot of good stuff.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:51.120]   So that's why we've kind of focused on this sense of coordinated inauthentic behavior.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:57.080]   So it's like if you have a network of, you know, whether it's bots, some people masquerading as different accounts,
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:08.500]   but you have kind of someone pulling the strings behind it and trying to kind of act as if this is a more organic set of behavior,
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:08.920]   but really, you know, it's kind of like a network of, you know, whether it's bots, some people masquerading as different accounts,
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:08.920]   but really, you know, it's kind of someone pulling the strings behind it and trying to kind of act as if this is a more organic set of behavior,

[01:49:51.140 --> 01:50:07.340]   be. I,
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:15.900]   can manage,
[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:16.040]   you know,
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:16.960]   seven or eight people.
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:19.840]   Um, but there was a reason why it was closer to three.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:22.160]   It was because we were growing so quickly,
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:25.120]   right? And when you're hiring so many people so quickly,
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:29.720]   then that means that you need managers who have capacity to onboard new
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:32.540]   people. Um, and also if you have a new manager,
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:35.480]   you may not want to have them have seven direct reports immediately cause you
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:36.320]   want them to ramp up.
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:37.660]   But,
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   the thing is,
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   going forward,
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   I don't really know how long it's going to take for them to get to
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   seven direct reports immediately cause you want them to ramp up.
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   But the thing is,
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   going forward,
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   I don't really know how long it's going to take for them to get to seven direct reports
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   immediately cause you want them to ramp up.
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   But the thing is,
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:51:05.900]  , going forward,
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:05.900]   I don't really know how long it's going to take for them to get to seven direct reports
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:05.900]   I don't really know how long it's going to take for them to hire that many people that quickly. Right? So I actually think we'll just do better work if we have more constraints and we're leaner as an organization. So in a world where we're not adding so many people as quickly, is it as valuable to have a lot of managers who have extra capacity waiting for new people? No, right? So now we can sort of defragment the organization and get to a place where the average is closer to that seven or eight.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:12.140]  è§€çœ¾
[01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:29.120]   more than a resume. And one of the things that we see is it's a pretty basic lesson, but like we have a much better sense of who the best people are who have interned at the company for a couple of months than by looking at them at kind of a resume or a short interview loop. Obviously the in-person feel that you get from someone probably tells you more than the resume.
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:59.140]   And on different teams even within a specific company. And it's like the people who come for even a short period of time over a summer, who do a great job here, you know that they're going to be great if they came and joined full time. And that's one of the reasons why we've invested so much in internship.
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:54:59.140]   And that's one of the reasons why we've invested so much in internship.
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:54:59.140]   And that's one of the reasons why we've invested so much in internship.
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:29.160]   And I think that there's, there's value in both, right? It's not, you know, I wouldn't want to run a fully remote job. I mean, it's, it's a thing that's here to stay. But I think that there's, there's value in both, right? It's not, you know, I wouldn't want to run a fully remote job.

And it's great also. In our own way, I think there are a lot of features that we have where we're leading on, and there are a lot of things that we don't have to do.

But let me step back to AI. I think we've mentioned it a little bit, but I'd like to linger on this question that folks like Eliezer Yudkowsky has to worry about and others of the existential, the serious threats of AI that have been reinvigorated now with the rapid development of AI systems.
[02:11:06.300 --> 02:11:33.340]   Do you worry about the existential risks of AI as Eliezer does about the alignment problem about this getting out of hand?

Sure. So I still don't think I have any particular insight on when like a singular AI system that is a general intelligence will get created. But I think the one thing that most people in the discourse I've seen about this haven't really grappled with is that we do seem to have organizations and structures in the world that exhibit greater than human intelligence already.
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:08.240]   So now one example is a company. It acts as an entity. It has a singular brand. Obviously it's a collection of people. But I certainly hope that Meta with tens of thousands of people make smarter decisions than one person. But I think that that would be pretty bad if it didn't. Another example that I think is even more removed from the way we think about the personification
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:36.900]  , which is often implied in some of these questions, is think about something like the stock market. The stock market takes inputs. It's a distributed system. It's like the cybernetic organism that probably millions of people around the world are basically voting every day by choosing what to invest in. But it's basically this organism or structure that is smarter than any other organism.
[02:25:36.900 --> 02:26:06.920]  , that we use to allocate capital as efficiently as possible around the world. And I do think that this notion that there are already these cybernetic systems that are either melding the intelligence of multiple people together or melding the intelligence of multiple people and technology together to form something which is a very complex and complex system.

[02:38:41.600 --> 02:39:11.560]  , like so many other people are doing this and like i hope you don't lose that spirit where when you you kind of grow up and you want to just continue building different things no matter what it is to me that's a lot of what matters that's the philosophical piece and the cultural piece is just about community and values and that part of part of things i think has just become a lot more important to me since i've had kids you know it's almost autopilot when you're a kid you're in the kind of getting imparted two phase of your life but

This is just this, the universe works in, we are definitely living in a simulation, but go ahead. Community tradition and the values that faith and religion instill. A lot of the topics that we've talked about today are around how do you, how do you balance, you know, whether it's
