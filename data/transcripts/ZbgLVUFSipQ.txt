[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.800]   found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the second chapter and the 12th verse.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.200]   The 12th verse in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians that at
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.520]   that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.000]   and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.200]   in the world. I would remind you again of the 11th verse which goes with this.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.360]   Remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh who are called
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.640]   uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.680]   without made by hands that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.080]   the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:13.520]   hope without God in the world. Now I would remind you that we are
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.460]   considering here this great argument which we saw last Sunday morning. The
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.200]   Apostle introduces in the 11th verse his fundamental object is to remind these
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.840]   Ephesian Christians of their wonderful position as Christians in Christ and he
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.120]   wants them to see that they are what they are for one reason only and that is
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.920]   because of the wondrous grace and mercy and power of God. And here he's
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.880]   particularly interested to demonstrate the power. That's the theme of the whole
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.800]   of this second chapter. We've already considered the first part. He shows that
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.520]   nothing but the power of God could ever have raised them from that condition in
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.300]   which they were dead in trespasses and sins. Nothing less than the power that
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.180]   raised Christ from the dead was adequate to deal with that problem but God has
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.640]   done it. But that was not the only thing that stood between these Ephesians
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.520]   formerly and becoming Christians. There was this other thing. There was this fact
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.600]   that they were Gentiles in the flesh. Now that according to the Apostle was a
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.920]   problem that presented itself in two forms. The first difficulty was that the
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.800]   attitude of the Jews towards them as Gentiles had to be overcome. And then
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.520]   secondly the attitude of God towards them as Gentiles also had to be
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.600]   overcome. Now the first problem we dealt with last Sunday morning. The problem of
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.300]   overcoming the attitude of the Jews toward them. You remember we saw that the
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.840]   Jews called themselves the circumcision and the others as the uncircumcision.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.720]   They put them outside the pale. They said there was no hope for them. They were
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:22.240]   gods, Gentiles. Now we spent our morning last Sunday in looking at this and in
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.800]   pointing out how tragic it was that the Jews in that way should so completely
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.400]   have misunderstood the purpose and the object of circumcision. It was a
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.960]   distinction introduced by God, yes, but not in the way in which the Jews had
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:46.280]   interpreted it. There you see attached too much significance to the mere
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.320]   external sign in the flesh. Hence Paul's sarcasm which are called uncircumcision
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.280]   by the circumcision in the flesh made by hands. And we spent our time in showing
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.520]   how that kind of thing, that outlook, that mentality is still the greatest cause of
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.640]   disruption and a lack of true unity not only in the world but also, alas, in the
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.200]   church. God has overcome it in the way that the Apostle proceeds to expound and
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.800]   to unfold. But now this morning in this twelfth verse we come to look at and to
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.280]   deal with the second aspect of this problem. How can these Ephesians who were
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.560]   Gentiles uncircumcised, how can they possibly be brought into the Christian
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.800]   church and be joined with Jewish Christians to form one new body, the
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.320]   Christian church? Well now that's the question with which the Apostle deals
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.440]   here and he does so in a most interesting manner. Let me put it to you
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:02.520]   like this. The distinction between Jew and Gentile was a very real one. We
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.120]   mustn't minimize it, we mustn't detract from it, we mustn't make light of it.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.720]   After all it was God himself who introduced the sign of circumcision. It
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.920]   was God who commanded Abraham to circumcise himself and his children and
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.160]   that this should be done in perpetuity. Therefore we mustn't underestimate that.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.960]   It is God's distinction, Jews, Gentiles. Yes, but though we recognize the
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.480]   distinction, we must be perfectly clear in our minds as to what it means and as
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.640]   to what it represents. And it was there that the Jews had gone so wrong. To them
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:52.920]   the external sign alone meant everything. It was something in the flesh, it was
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.600]   something external. Is a man circumcised? Then he's all right, he's one of God's
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.120]   people. Is he not? Well then he is not and he has no hope. They'd completely
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.160]   misunderstood the point of it, the purpose of it, and the spirit of it. Now
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.040]   the Apostle Paul, as you know, deals with this question in many of his epistles. He
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.560]   puts it, for instance, in a particularly clear manner in his epistle to the
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:24.040]   Romans in the second chapter in verses 28 and 29 where he puts it like this. He
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.240]   says, "He is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.200]   which is outward in the flesh, but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.600]   circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:49.720]   not of men but of God." They'd completely failed, in other words, to see and to
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.680]   realize that the whole object of this was something spiritual in the mind of
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.640]   God. Now the Apostle, I say, is very concerned about this. Some people, when
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.320]   they hear that there is no longer circumcision or uncircumcision and Jew
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.600]   and Gentile and so on, are prone to say, "Well, very well then, we need pay no
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.120]   attention to these things." Some Christians have been foolish enough to
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.880]   say that because we are Christians we don't need the Old Testament. But that
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.280]   says the Apostle again in the epistle to the Romans is quite wrong. "What advantage
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.760]   then hath the Jew, or what profit is there in circumcision?" And he replies,
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.560]   "Much every way, chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of God."
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.320]   And then you remember in the ninth chapter of that epistle to the Romans he
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.080]   works out the same argument again. He says he has great heaviness
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.760]   and continual sorrow in his heart. "I could wish that myself were accursed from
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.440]   Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.280]   Israelites." And what does that mean? Well, here it is. "To whom pertaineth the
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.320]   adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.200]   service of God and the promises, whose are the fathers and of whom as
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all God blessed forever." Oh yes,
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.560]   there was a very real purpose and object in the distinction between Jew and
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:31.240]   Gentile. It wasn't as the Jews misinterpreted it, but it was there and
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:37.160]   it was a tremendously important thing. And here now in the twelfth verse, Paul
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.400]   gives the true view of it. In the eleventh, the false view of circumcision. In the
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.440]   twelfth, the true view of circumcision and the absence of circumcision. Well now, he
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.920]   puts it, you notice, in a most interesting and extraordinary and at
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:09:00.800]   first sight surprising manner. This is how he puts it. That at that time he were
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.960]   without Christ. Oh, that's a strange way of putting it. Without Christ, which can
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.360]   be translated, if you like, apart from Christ, outside of Christ, and not in
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.440]   fellowship with Christ, not in relationship to Christ, or if you prefer
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.520]   it, living apart from Christ. And then having put it like that in general, he
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.720]   then goes on to put it in particular in five separate points. Being aliens from
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.760]   the Commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the covenants of promise, having no
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:46.800]   hope without God in the world. Now this surely demands our careful attention. He
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.280]   is obviously referring to the position which obtained before Christ, under the
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.980]   old dispensation, if you like, under the Old Testament. There is the world divided
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:03.520]   into Jews and Gentiles. Those who as Jews have been circumcised, and the
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.000]   uncircumcised, the Gentiles, the other nations. And yet you notice that he
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.320]   refers to that time and to that condition in these terms, without Christ,
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:21.960]   outside Christ. Here he is referring to a position which obtained before the Lord
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.400]   Jesus Christ ever came into the world, and yet he puts it in terms of being in
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:34.360]   Christ or outside Christ, living apart from Christ. And one may very well ask,
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.640]   well why does the Apostle do this? Why does he describe that in terms of a
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.640]   relationship to Christ? Well the answer is of course that he is doing something
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.600]   which in a sense he's bound to do. And unless we understand and grasp clearly
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.160]   what he is doing here, well then we must have read our Old Testament always in
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.960]   vain. Here you see he takes a general review of the Old Testament, what
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.600]   characterizes it? Well here it is, the commonwealth of Israel, the covenants of
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.960]   promise, the hope that God gave to the people, their relationship to God, their
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.000]   separation from the world. That's a summary of the condition and the position
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.040]   of the Israelites under the Old Testament dispensation. All the other
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.760]   nations were outside that. And yet you see he describes it all in terms of
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:34.640]   being in Christ, outside Christ. Well how do we interpret and reconcile this? Well
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:43.160]   this is the answer. Everything that God did to and for the Jews under the old
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:50.880]   dispensation was done with an eye to Christ. Everything in the Old Testament
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.600]   looks forward to Christ. We must never look at any of these things in and of
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   themselves. Everything that God did to those Jews, those Israelites, he did in
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.400]   preparation for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now the Apostle of course
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:15.600]   puts that, you remember, in a phrase in Galatians 3, 23, like this. He says that
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:22.480]   the purpose of all that was to shut us up unto the faith which should afterward
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.440]   be revealed. The law was a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. It was never meant
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.640]   to be anything in and of itself. That's where the Jews went wrong. They thought
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.360]   the law was something in and of itself, and that they were saved because they
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.480]   got the law and others hadn't got the law. No, no, says Paul, the law is our
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.520]   schoolmaster, our pedagogue, to bring us to Christ. The purpose of all these things
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:55.040]   is to shut us up unto the faith that should yet be revealed. Well now then,
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:03.800]   let's look at it like this. God made men in his own image, and there men lived in
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.400]   correspondence and in fellowship with God. But alas, you remember, he sinned and
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:16.680]   fell away from God. He gave birth to progeny. The earth became filled with
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:23.560]   people. And until the call of Abraham, the whole world and all its peoples and its
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:30.240]   nations were in the one relationship to God. There is no division really, in an
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.800]   ultimate sense, until you come to the call of Abram. There is a kind of
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.440]   division already between Cain and Abel and so on, and the line of Seth. But God
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:45.160]   has dealt with all nations and all peoples in the same way until the call
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:52.480]   of Abraham. And there God does something new. He told Abraham that he was going to
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.520]   turn him into a nation, that out of his loins a great nation would come, a people
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.640]   special and peculiar to the Lord God himself. He was going to create a
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.520]   new nation, a special nation. He was going to set them apart from all the other
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.440]   peoples, and he was going to be in a peculiar relationship to them. That's the
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:20.000]   formation of Israel. That's the genesis of the Commonwealth of Israel, the people
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.600]   of God. Then you remember that with these people he made certain covenants. He gave
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:35.680]   certain promises to them. He pledged himself to them. He took this man Abram
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.840]   aside and he said, "In thee and through thy seed shall all the nations of the earth
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:48.080]   be blessed." God covenanted with Abram. He pledged himself to him. He took an oath.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.680]   That's the meaning of covenants. And you have all these promises after repeated.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.440]   The one great covenant repeated in various forms, repeated at Sinai, repeated
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.920]   again to David, preached by the prophets. Here it all is. The Commonwealth of
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.320]   Israel, the covenants of promise, and all these things, and they're all looking
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:17.680]   forward to the coming of the Messiah, to the great Deliverer. In other words, the
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.380]   thing we must grasp is this, that God now looks down upon the world and its people
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:30.340]   in two ways. He looks upon this covenant people in one way, he looks upon the
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:36.480]   others in another way. And the covenant people are known by the sign and the
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.960]   mark of circumcision. Every boy that was born into Israel was to be circumcised
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.920]   on the eighth day. He belonged to this covenant people, this nation of Israel,
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:55.640]   God's people. There are God's people, here are the others. Now that's the thing that
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.840]   the Apostle is reminding these Ephesians of. And as I say, his object in doing it
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:08.480]   was this. He wants them to realize the greatness of their salvation. He wants
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.160]   them to realize that the fact that they are now fellow citizens, fellow heirs
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.420]   with the saints of the household of God. He wants them to realize that this is
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:23.240]   the most astounding thing that could ever have happened. And the only way in
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.560]   which they can understand it is to understand something of the exceeding
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.800]   greatness of God's power to us what that believe. It's not only a power that
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.980]   raises us from the death of sin, it's a power that overcomes this tremendous
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.240]   question of how can those who are outside the covenant relationship ever
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:52.440]   be brought into it. And so he goes on to explain it and to expand it to them. No
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.200]   man will ever rejoice as he ought to in Christ unless he realizes his position
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.520]   before he became a Christian. The trouble with everybody who is not rejoicing in
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.240]   Christ this morning is that they've never realized what they were in sin.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.520]   It's no use talking about only being positive, you must start with your
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:18.000]   negative. If you don't realize what you were before God took hold of you, you'll
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.720]   never praise him as you ought. So Paul goes into it in great detail. There are
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.160]   so many people who have never seen any need of Christ. Why? Well because they're
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.440]   self-satisfied, they think they're all right as they are. That's the trouble.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.280]   Paul is anxious that these people should understand it. He's prayed that God would
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:43.440]   open the eyes of their understanding that they might do so. "There you were," he says,
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:49.440]   "but now you've been brought nigh by the blood of Christ. Can't you see what God
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.840]   has done? Can't you see the measure of his love and grace and mercy and his
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:01.560]   almighty power?" That's his argument. Well now then, let's look at it. And let's look
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:08.040]   at it in order to apply it to ourselves. Do you know in your heart as well as in
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:14.080]   your mind this morning this wonderful love of God? Are you thrilled as you
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   think of it and conceive of it? Are you filled with a sense of wonder, love, and
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.160]   praise? If not, it's because you don't realize what God has done for you in
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:32.520]   Christ. Well here it is, let's put it like this. What is the teaching? Well the way
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:41.440]   to understand it is to look at what it means not to be a Christian without
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:49.800]   Christ, outside Christ. In other words, the first principle we lay down is this,
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:55.560]   the one thing that matters in this life and in this world is to be related to
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:04.600]   God in Christ. There is nothing more terrible that can be said about anybody
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:15.000]   than this, without Christ, living apart from Christ. You see, when the apostle
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.640]   looks for a term in which he can show these people the distance they were away
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.720]   and the utter hopelessness of their position, this is the term he chooses,
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:33.440]   without Christ, living apart from Christ. In no living relationship to Christ
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.920]   there's nothing worse than that. But on the other hand, therefore, there is
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:43.280]   nothing more wonderful than to be in Christ. These are the New Testament terms,
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:51.600]   in Christ, outside Christ. My friends, those are the only two positions that
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:59.680]   matter this morning. We are all of us either in Christ or else outside Christ.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.960]   Do you know exactly where you are? This isn't theory, this is actual fact and
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.200]   practice. This is the thing that's going to determine our eternal destiny. We are
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:17.880]   either in Christ or outside Christ. And it's because they don't know what is
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.360]   meant by being outside Christ that there are millions of people in the world
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.280]   today who are spending their Sunday morning in reading newspapers and the
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.720]   filth of the law courts, instead of looking into the Word of God. They don't
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:39.000]   realize what they are as outside Christ. So Paul tells them in detail what it
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.160]   meant. What a terrible position to be in. Well, what's it mean? Well, let's classify
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:52.200]   it like this. It means two things, and let me suggest this classification of the
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:59.320]   five things which the Apostle says. First of all, let us consider what it means to
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:08.800]   be outside Christ as regards our position, or if you like, as regards our
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:15.280]   relationship to God. And then secondly, we will look at the inevitable
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.360]   consequences of that position. Paul says five things. Aliens from the
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.440]   Commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise, without hope,
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:31.480]   without God in the world. I classify them into two headings. First of all, what it
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:37.640]   means to be without Christ as regards our relationship to God. And here the
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:42.600]   Apostle says two things, the first two. The first is that we are in that state
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:49.840]   and condition, aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel. Now what does
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.520]   this mean? Well, in a sense I've already been describing it to you. A Commonwealth
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:05.360]   means a community of citizens or of people definitely constituted. That's
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.280]   what's meant by a Commonwealth, a polity if you like. It doesn't matter about the
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.880]   exact meaning of the term. It means that in a way, a number of people who are
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.560]   definitely constituted into a community. There's something separate and discreet
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:29.000]   and which you can recognize. And what we are told therefore is this, that God in
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.120]   the way I've indicated formed a community for himself. This is God's way
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:43.560]   of salvation. He forms a people, he forms a community, he sets them apart and he is
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.800]   in a peculiar relationship to them. If you want a description of that you read
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.440]   the 19th chapter of the book of Exodus. It's there in detail and you'll find the
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.720]   Apostle Peter quotes it in the first epistle in the second chapter of verses
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:05.640]   9 and 10. God gathered these people together there, you remember, before he
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.760]   gave them the Ten Commandments. And he said you are a peculiar people to me.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:16.920]   You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, and holy nation, a people for
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:25.960]   my peculiar possession. That's it. He set them apart for himself. He divides them
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:32.320]   off from everybody else. Ah yes, but it doesn't stop at that you see. He does
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:39.640]   that because he's going to take a special interest in them. They are a
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:46.440]   people for his own peculiar possession. So that later on God said through the
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:53.280]   Prophet Amos to this nation of Israel, "You only have I known of all the nations
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.140]   of the earth." That doesn't mean obviously that he wasn't aware of all
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.440]   the others. Of course he was. To know in the scripture means to take a very
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.920]   special personal interest in, to be concerned about, to care for, to look with
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:12.040]   a father's eye and with a loving gaze. "You only have I known of all the nations
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:18.440]   of the earth." That was Israel. God saw all the other nations but he didn't know
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:25.140]   them. He didn't take this peculiar interest in them. They were outside the
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:31.400]   commonwealth of Israel. They were aliens. And indeed the word used here by Paul is
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.840]   very interesting. It reads here, "being aliens." It should be translated, "having
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:43.040]   been made aliens, having become aliens." In other words, man was never meant to be
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:48.320]   in this position. It's all the result of the fall and the result of sin. He's
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:57.260]   become an alien outside the peculiar interest of God. That is the first thing
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.320]   that is meant by being without Christ.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:08.600]   That you're outside that circle in which God is peculiarly interested. You don't
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.760]   belong to the covenant people. You are just one of a great mass somewhere.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:22.960]   There's not this special interest, this special object of concern. Aliens from
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:28.760]   the commonwealth of Israel. It's the Christian Church that corresponds to the
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:35.480]   commonwealth of Israel today. It's Christian people. And the most terrible
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:41.040]   thing about a man who's not a Christian is this, that he's outside that circle.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:50.160]   Doesn't belong to them. Are you an alien from the commonwealth of Israel, my
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:57.000]   friend? Do you feel strange in this service? Do you say to yourself, "What's
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.720]   that man talking about? What's all this? It doesn't seem to be very practical. It
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.480]   doesn't seem to be dealing with a conference that's about to be
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.160]   held in Washington, or the visit of the Queen to somewhere in Africa. It's not
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.960]   relevant. It's not up-to-date. No, no. I'm talking about God's citizenship, God's
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:21.480]   commonwealth." Is this strange and alien to you? Or do you feel you belong to it?
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:26.240]   It's a terrible thing to feel you're an outsider, that you're not a part of these
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.280]   things, that somehow they've got nothing to do with you. Are you in? Do you love
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.600]   the brethren? Are you a part of these things? It's a terrible thing, I say, to be
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:41.640]   outside Christ. It means you're an alien from the commonwealth of Israel. What
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:47.560]   else? Well, the next thing he tells us is this, that they are strangers from the
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:57.240]   covenants of promise. I have reminded you of the covenants that God made. He took
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.760]   hold of Abram, not because there was anything peculiarly good about Abram. He
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.720]   was a pagan amongst other pagans. God called him out and said, "Look here. I've
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:11.480]   set my eye on you. I'm going to bless you. I pledge myself to you." As the author of
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.480]   the epistle to the Hebrews reminds us, he did it with an oath. He pledged himself
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:23.280]   and gave an oath that it might be sure to Abram and to his seed. The promises of
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:29.160]   God. You read your Old Testament and you see them one after another. God calls
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.520]   these men apart. He gives them a revelation, a vision. He addresses them. He
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.120]   sends a word to them. They've got something that keeps them going. It was
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.080]   the whole secret of the people who are described in the 11th chapter of the
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:47.880]   epistle to the Hebrews. The promises, the covenants of God. God looking upon them
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.800]   and saying, "It's all right. Let the other nations envy you and try to destroy you.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.400]   Let men rise up against you. It doesn't matter. You are my people. I will never
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.200]   let you go. I will never leave thee nor forsake thee. Hold on to my covenant word,
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:08.080]   my promise. Look forward to this, the covenants of promise." But the Ephesians
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:15.800]   were strangers to all that. The Gentile nations knew nothing about this. You see,
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.520]   while these peculiar people of God, the Jews, were receiving these great
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.200]   messages and rejoicing in them, the others knew nothing at all about it.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.960]   Strangers, absolute strangers. Hadn't heard of it, knew nothing about it, not
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:39.480]   interested. And that is still true of all who are outside Christ. Those who are not
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:46.160]   living in relationship to Christ. They can read their Bibles and it doesn't
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.840]   move them. They can look into these exceeding great and precious promises
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.320]   and they say, "To whom does this apply? What's all this about? They're strangers.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.000]   They're like people in another country and they don't understand the language.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.440]   Does the Bible speak to you, my friend? Is it unintelligible to you? Do you feel
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.040]   it's a gibberish and a jargon? Or does it speak to you and speak words that lift
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:15.520]   you on your feet and make you praise God?" Are you a stranger to the covenants of
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.320]   promise? Or do you know that they're speaking to you? That you're a member of
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:26.000]   the company? That God is addressing you as you read his holy word. Oh, what a
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.400]   terrible thing it is to be outside Christ, not in a living relationship to
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:38.160]   Christ. Now there it is, I say, first of all in terms of our standing or our
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:44.120]   relationship to God. But let me ask you to consider for a moment the inevitable
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:54.940]   consequences of that. There are three of them. The first is without hope. I don't
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.440]   know what you feel. I think that that's the most terrible statement in the whole
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:09.920]   of Scripture. Without hope, there's nothing worse than that. While there's
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.040]   life, there's hope, yes, but when hope goes, there's nothing. Hope is the last
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:25.140]   thing that goes. And when hope has gone, chaos is come again. As Macbeth put it,
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:31.900]   that a man who's without Christ is without hope. What's he mean? Well, I
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:38.640]   think he means this. He has no hope in this life. And Ed, you realize that without
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:46.580]   Christ there is no hope in this life, in this world, none at all. Is that an
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:50.580]   exaggeration? Well, I ask you to consider the statements of the profoundest
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:56.460]   thinkers the world has ever known. And you'll find that they're invariably
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:04.680]   pessimists. The greatest works of Shakespeare are his tragedies. Every
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:12.540]   religion, apart from the Christian faith, is profoundly pessimistic. The only
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:17.340]   comfort they give you is this, that you get out of this world sometime. You may
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.060]   have to go through a whole series of reincarnations, but there's no hope here.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:26.780]   You've got to get out of it, and somehow or another be lost in some nirvana. They
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:31.680]   have no hope for men in this world. It's the flesh, the body, they say, and yet
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.620]   there's no hope for you while you're in it. You've got to get out of this world.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:41.540]   Hinduism, Buddhism, they're all completely hopeless. They're the products of
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:50.280]   profound thinking without revelation, but they're all hopeless. Oh, I say, this is
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.220]   something that you find in all the great philosophies, in all the great religions.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:59.060]   You'll find it in all the great literature. Have you noticed that our
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:05.700]   greatest poets are always pessimists? A man like Wordsworth tells us that he's
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:13.020]   been listening to the still, sad music of humanity. Of course, if you're flitting
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.180]   about from dance hall to dance hall and cinema to cinema, you won't hear it,
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:21.420]   because there's such a clatter and a noise that you can't hear it. But a man,
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.860]   a poet, he sits, he listens, he meditates, and what does he hear? Isn't life
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:36.780]   wonderful? No. What he hears is the still, sad music of humanity. Life is real, life
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:41.820]   is honest. It isn't a giddy round of pleasure after pleasure. No, no, there is
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.940]   no hope in this life and in this world. It's all summarized very perfectly for us
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:51.420]   in the book of Ecclesiastes, isn't it, where the man there says, "Vanity of
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:57.260]   vanities, all is vanity." That's not mere, sheer pessimism. It's a profound thinker
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:01.260]   who's tried all the possibilities, considered all the things that are
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:07.700]   offered, and they've all come to nothing. What is has already been, and what is
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.820]   shall be. There is nothing new under the sun. There is no hope for the world. It's
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:17.780]   not going to get better and better. And you see, this fatal idealism of the last
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.460]   hundred years is utterly condemned by all the great thinking of the centuries,
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:27.220]   and of course it's utterly discredited by today. There is no hope in this life
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:32.820]   and in this world apart from Christ. Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, can be
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:39.900]   written over it all. Not only is there no hope that things will be better, but
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:45.940]   there is no hope that man himself will get better. He's no better than he
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:51.660]   was under the Old Testament dispensation. He's still committing the same sins. He's
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:56.260]   still guilty of the same follies. There is no evidence of spiritual improvement
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:02.820]   in men. Man today is as rotten as he was the moment he fell in the Garden of Eden.
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:08.500]   And above and beyond it all, there is absolutely nothing whatsoever to look
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:17.460]   forward to. We are all getting older, our powers are failing. Death must come
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.940]   inevitably. Do what you will, you can't get away from it. That's life without
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:30.100]   Christ. Oh, let's listen to Shakespeare summing it up as usual. He puts it
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:35.180]   perfectly at the end of his life in one of his last dramas. The cloud-capped
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:40.260]   towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, yea, all
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:45.580]   which it inherits shall dissolve, and like the insubstantial pageant faded,
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:52.460]   leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:35:00.140]   little life is rounded with a sleep. That's life without Christ. No hope.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:05.620]   Absolutely none. This isn't pessimism, this is realism. This is facing the facts.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.460]   There is no hope in this world. It's not getting better. Look at your papers, look
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:17.380]   at the facts. Man's not improving, and there's nothing but death. The cloud-capped
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:22.220]   tower, the gorgeous palaces, the great globe itself, everything, it's going to
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:30.100]   dissolve. And if there is no hope in this life, in this world, there is certainly no
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:37.860]   hope beyond it for the men who's outside Christ. Death is but the journey's end to
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:45.100]   him. As Horatius Bonner puts it in his hymn, "Men die in darkness at thy side,
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:51.940]   without a hope to cheer the tomb." They look forward, what do they see? Nothing.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:57.620]   They can't see death. They haven't the faith that sees through death. What lies
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.580]   beyond they don't know. They either say there's nothing, or else there is
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.700]   torment, or else a series of reincarnations, as I've said. They don't
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.580]   know, and as they look at the end, they're leaving everything. The palaces are
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:20.540]   collapsing, and there, nothing, without hope. That's life without Christ. That's
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.740]   the life that is being lived by millions of people in this country today, who think
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.460]   that we are fools because we're sitting in a chapel listening to this old gospel.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:32.300]   They think they've got life and freedom and everything abundantly, but that's
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:46.580]   their position. No hope. But even worse, without God. What's he mean by this? Well,
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:53.140]   by this he means, obviously, without a subjective experience of God. He is
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:58.180]   referring to a subjective absence of God. God is still there, of course, but these
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.980]   people don't know that. They're not aware of that, and therefore they're not
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:07.180]   enjoying God. Shall I summarize it like this? They don't know God, and they're not
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:12.340]   in fellowship with God, therefore they are without all the help and all the
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:18.300]   peace and all the joy that comes through the knowledge of God and faith in God.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:23.220]   Their world is collapsing, everything is going wrong, they're left alone, and
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:28.900]   they're in their utter isolation, they have nothing. They don't know God. There
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.220]   are other people in the same position. Christians have troubles in this life,
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:37.180]   accidents take place, things go wrong. The Christian, in circumstances, may be
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:41.660]   identical with the other men. Yes, but there's this difference. The other man is
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:49.020]   without God. The Christian has God and knows God. But this other man, I say, is
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:56.500]   without God. Oh, how different he is from the psalmist, isn't he? Because the
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:02.300]   psalmist, you remember, said this, "When my father and mother forsake me, then the
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:07.140]   Lord shall take me up." His father and mother have left him and deserted him.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:11.340]   Friends and companions have all gone. Everything has gone. It's all right, says
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:17.060]   the man, "When my father and mother forsake me, then, even then, the Lord shall
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:23.060]   take me up." Listen to him again, "I laid me down and slept." He was surrounded by
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:29.020]   enemies at that point. "I laid me down and slept. I awaked." Why? "For the Lord
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:35.260]   sustained me." Listen to him at another time, "Out of the depths have I cried unto
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:40.020]   thee." He was down in a horrible pit, and all seemed to have gone, but he looked up.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:47.900]   God was still there. "I cried unto the Lord out of the depths. The Lord is my
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:54.420]   shepherd. I shall not want. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:00.420]   death, thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. I'm seeing nothing
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:07.860]   else now. I still see them." The other man doesn't know this. He's without God. "The
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:14.300]   Lord is my light and my salvation. What shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:22.420]   my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? With God, not without God." But listen to him
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:28.500]   putting it again in one amazing statement, "From the end of the earth will
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:34.580]   I cry unto thee. When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:40.860]   higher than I. There he is almost drowning in the ocean with enemies and
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:46.340]   everything against me. He cries unto God, 'Lead me to the rock that is higher than
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:54.540]   I, and there I shall be safe.'" But this other man doesn't know this. He's without
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:59.460]   Christ and therefore without God. How unlike the Apostle Paul. Listen to Paul
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:06.020]   putting it. "At my first answer he says, 'No man stood with me, but all men forsook
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:13.340]   me.' I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. Notwithstanding,
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:21.100]   the Lord stood with me and strengthened me." Paul was on trial. All his friends
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:27.740]   left him. "No man stood with me. All men forsook me. Notwithstanding, the Lord
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:36.340]   stood with me and strengthened me." And again he writes to Timothy and he says,
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:42.420]   "I'm in prison and everything's going against me. Nevertheless I am not ashamed,
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:47.580]   for I know in whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:53.580]   that which I have committed unto him until that day. Oh yes," says the author
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.700]   of the epistle to the Hebrews, quoting the Old Testament, "the Lord is my helper
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:03.620]   I shall not fear what men shall do unto me." Why? Well God has said, "I will never
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:09.700]   leave thee nor forsake thee." But this other man doesn't know that. He's left to
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.580]   himself. His world has collapsed. Everything's gone wrong. He's not only
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:21.220]   got no hope, he's without God. And he can't look forward to a day which is coming
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:25.300]   when, according to that passage in the book of Revelation that we read at the
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:33.100]   beginning, "God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be sorrow
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:39.860]   and sighing and weeping no more." This man without Christ, he doesn't know these
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:44.660]   things. Oh but how unlike our Lord himself is. Listen to the Lord saying it,
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:50.500]   "Behold the hour cometh, yea, is now come that he shall be scattered every man to
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:42:03.500]   his own and shall leave me alone. And yet I am not alone for the Father is with me."
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:09.660]   He wasn't without God. No, no, God was with him when all had forsaken and had fled.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:17.540]   "And yet I am not alone, the Father is with me." Oh what a terrible thing it must
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:23.540]   be to be without hope and without God in the world, belonging to this passing
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:28.380]   world that's under the wrath of God, under condemnation, and is yet to be
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:34.700]   destroyed. The world passeth away and the lusts thereof, but he that doeth the will
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:46.180]   of God abideth forever. Beloved people, I trust that there is no one in this
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:53.420]   service who is without Christ. My friend, if you are, do you realize where you are?
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:59.740]   Outside the commonwealth, the special interest of God. No promises, no hope
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:06.660]   without God in the world. If you see it and if you know what that means, there's
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:17.020]   only one thing for you to do, fly to Christ. The Ephesians were there, but now
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:29.900]   in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:35.620]   Christ. You needn't remain an outsider. You needn't feel these things don't
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:40.380]   belong to you. They do God speaking to you. Believe him, listen to him, act upon
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:47.020]   it, go to him, confess that all that has been true of you, and cast yourself upon
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:53.860]   his love and grace and mercy and compassion, and he will receive you. And
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:59.260]   he will tell you that he sent his Son to die and to shed his blood for you, that
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:03.780]   you might be reconciled to him and might become his child and might become a
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:09.740]   fellow citizen with the saints and of the household of God. And you'll have a
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:14.780]   new life and a new hope and you'll know God and you'll know that he'll never
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:23.700]   leave you nor forsake you. Fly to him and if you're already there, rejoice in him
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:31.740]   to be in Christ. There is nothing beyond it. It is heaven on earth, it is the
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.180]   fortress of eternal bliss. Amen.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:42.820]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
