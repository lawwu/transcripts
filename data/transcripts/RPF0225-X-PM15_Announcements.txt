[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.800]   Good morning, Radicals. This is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:44.100]   Couple of quick announcements for you, the most pressing of which is I want to let you know if you are anywhere near the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas this weekend,
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.000]   come and see me, especially come and have breakfast with me on Friday morning.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.700]   As I record this here, it's early in the morning on Wednesday and I am leaving today for Texas.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:09.000]   I expect to arrive on Thursday afternoon there in Fort Worth, Texas to attend the Podcast Movement Conference at the Omni Hotel in downtown Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   As part of that, I am scheduling a Radical Personal Finance Community meetup.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.300]   It will be at 7 a.m. at the Cast Iron Restaurant, which is in the Omni Hotel in downtown Fort Worth.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.700]   So if you are able to come and have breakfast with me on Friday, that would be great.
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.500]   I would love to see you. If you can't come at 7, come at 8.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.300]   I will be there around the event all weekend.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.500]   So if you are not able to come to breakfast still, let me know.
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:40.800]   Reach out to me on Twitter. My handle on Twitter is @JoshuaSheets, spelled S-H-E-A-T-S, and I would love to connect with you.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:52.300]   I do plan the best day to come, if you'd like to come and have breakfast with me and other listeners of the show, is to come on Friday morning, again at 7 a.m., July 31, 2015.
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.300]   However, I will be having breakfast at that same restaurant probably each day at 7 a.m., Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.300]   So if you'd like to come another day, if you're not able to come on Friday, just reach out to me on Twitter @JoshuaSheets.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.300]   Let me know, and we will connect so that you're able to come, and I'd love to meet as many of you as possible.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.300]   If you are planning on coming on Friday, it would be very helpful if you would register.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:30.800]   Link is in the description of this show, but verbally here, it's a Bitly link, so go to bit.ly/rpfatpm15.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   PM is podcast movement, so bit.ly/rpfat@pm15.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   That'll take you to an Eventbrite page where you can sign up and register.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   No cost associated with it.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   It just will help me to make sure that I have a reservation for the appropriate number of people.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   That's announcement number one.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   Announcement number two is that there will be no shows for the next week other than some replays and maybe a couple of short shows and maybe my releasing an interview or two of other places that I have been interviewed.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   I apologize. I've got a couple of interviews recorded.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   I've been working hard this week to get things done.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   My goal is to have a whole bunch of things launched before I leave, but it's not done.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   I had a busy, challenging week with a new little baby girl, getting her settled in, and she's not been the happiest.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   She's fine, nothing too wrong, but she's not been super happy.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   It's just been a real challenge to get all my work done.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   I've been trying to fit it in.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   As I record this, it's 3.46 a.m. right now.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   I leave at 4.30 for Texas.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   I've been up since 3.00.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   Yesterday was up at 4.00.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   Unfortunately, there's not enough hours in the day to get it all done.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   So I'm about one day behind on my to-do list, but I've got a number of new recommendations and affiliates that I'll be launching.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   I have a number of shows planned, so I'll do my best to keep them coming to you all, but don't expect any new shows for the next week until I'm back from Texas.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   Those are my announcements.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.800]   I thank you all, each and every one of you, for listening and for your support, and come see me in Texas.
