[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.040]   found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the first chapter and looking
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.240]   particularly this morning at the last two verses namely verses 22 and 23.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.680]   "And doth put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.520]   things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.600]   all." But obviously we can't just read that much we must go further back. The
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.640]   Apostle is here you remember offering this great prayer for the Ephesians that
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.880]   the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory may give unto you the
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.680]   spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.160]   understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.920]   what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.560]   the exceeding greatness of his power to us were to believe according to the
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.340]   working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.960]   from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.560]   above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.840]   is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and doth put
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.000]   all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.760]   church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all. Now we are
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.560]   engaged at the moment and have been for a number of Sunday mornings in
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.000]   considering this third petition that is offered by the Apostle in that prayer
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.320]   this prayer of his in other words that these Ephesians and all other Christians
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.920]   may come to know the exceeding greatness of God's power in us who believe. There
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.680]   is nothing he seems to say that is more important for us in this world than just
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.760]   to realize that. We therefore have taken time to consider his own definition of
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.280]   the power the measurement of the power the standard by which he does assess the
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.320]   greatness of this power and then we have gone on to consider why it is that we
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.080]   should realize this and why this power is necessary and we have seen that we
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.080]   cannot even become Christians at all apart from this power. It takes the power
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.920]   of Almighty God to make a Christian. No man can make himself a Christian. It is
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.740]   this exceedingly great power of God exercised in us that makes us Christian
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.380]   at all and in the same way we have seen that we couldn't stand nor continue for
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.720]   a moment in the Christian life were it not that we were held and sustained and
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.480]   enabled by this self same power. Now having looked at it like that in general
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.680]   we come to this further statement concerning it which is given by the
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.840]   Apostle here at the end of the chapter in these verses that we are now looking
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.840]   at. Now if you read of this passage rather hurriedly and thoughtlessly you
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.740]   might very well come to the conclusion that from verse 20 to the end of the
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.360]   chapter is nothing but a digression. The Apostle is praying that we may know the
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.320]   exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe according to the
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.240]   working of his mighty power and then he seems to go off at a tangent in
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.480]   describing the power. He says it's the power that he exercised when he brought
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.440]   Christ from the dead and then he seems to have forgotten what he was writing
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.240]   about and he goes on after that theme of Christ risen from the dead and he thinks
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.320]   of his exaltation and of his power and so on and the relationship of that to
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.560]   the church and he seems to have left his theme and only to return to it in the
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.000]   first verse of the next chapter. But actually of course the Apostle has not
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.360]   forgotten his theme. There is a sense in which these verses are a slight
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.880]   digression but if we examine them closely we will find that rarely he is
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.320]   still dealing with the essential matter that he is considering. Look at it like
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.240]   this. He wants us all to realize the greatness of this power that is working
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.840]   in us. He wants us to know how it works. There is the definition of it. We've seen
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.640]   the reasons why we need it. Well now then, how exactly does this power actually come
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.600]   to us and work in us? And that I suggest to you is the matter with which he deals
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:25.140]   in these last two verses. And he does so in terms of this idea of the church as
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:33.240]   the body of Christ. Now we are here face to face with one of the great New
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.320]   Testament doctrines. There is no more central doctrine in the New Testament
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.480]   than the doctrine of the Christian church. And I suppose there is no figure
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.080]   which is used quite so frequently in order to give us some idea of the
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:57.760]   doctrine of the church as this picture or this metaphor of the church as the
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.240]   body of Christ. You will find that he uses it in his epistle to the Romans and
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.520]   in his epistle to the Corinthians quite directly. And he has it by suggestion in
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:19.640]   many places also in other epistles. And we can be quite sure that we are not
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:26.040]   exaggerating when we say that there is no more exalted idea or notion or
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:33.840]   picture in the entire range of the New Testament teaching than this. It's not
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.620]   surprising that the Apostle should have prayed so earnestly that we might have
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.280]   the spirit of wisdom and revelation. It's not surprising that he repeats it and
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.200]   says that we need to have the eyes of our understandings enlightened. For this
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.080]   is undoubtedly one of the highest of all the doctrines. You notice that the
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.480]   Apostle in the fifth chapter of this epistle to the Ephesians refers to this
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.260]   doctrine as a great mystery. And the mystery by definition is not something
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.040]   that is easily understood. It isn't something that cannot be understood, but
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.120]   it is something that is not easily understood. And the Apostle himself does
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:23.440]   tell us that this is a matter which is not obvious and that it is only as we
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.920]   are enlightened by the Holy Spirit that we can understand it at all. Very well
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.680]   then I assure you at this moment that I shall be taxing your concentration this
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:42.240]   morning. I trust that that does not come as a disappointment to anybody. These New
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.200]   Testament epistles my friends were written to men and women like you and
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.880]   myself. Indeed they were written to people who had not had your advantages
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.520]   and mine. It seems clear that the majority of the members of the early
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.400]   church were slaves. They had had no sort of education in the sense that we speak
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.000]   of education today. And when the Apostle Paul wrote this letter to them he meant
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.560]   them to read it, he meant them to understand it, he meant them to grapple
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.320]   with it. He knows they can't do it by their natural powers, but he does know
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.760]   that any man who is enlightened by the Holy Spirit not only wants to understand
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.320]   it, but can understand it. And that he realizes that it is his duty to do so. I
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.680]   know of nothing that is so discouraging about the modern church. I know of
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.600]   nothing which is such a condemnation of the modern church as her failure to
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.960]   grapple with these great New Testament truths. This constantly repeated talk
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.880]   about simplicity. Of course the evangelistic message is to be simple, but
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.560]   here is great and glorious truth which is meant for us. And we've got to make
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.080]   an effort. The church is not a place in which people are to be entertained. It
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.680]   isn't a place in which you just come and sit and listen either to singing or
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.400]   other forms of entertainment and some simple light comforting doctrine. If we
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:15.080]   want to be grown men, if we want to rise to the height of our high calling in
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:21.080]   Christ Jesus, if we want to be virile Christians in this terrible modern world,
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:28.740]   well then the only way is to face these great and glorious doctrines and to
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.600]   exercise our minds, our understandings, and all our senses until we begin to
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.880]   have some dim conception of ourselves in this great setting, in this glorious
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.360]   context. Very well. Now then, let's consider what the apostle has to say
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:52.080]   here about the church. Obviously the apostle himself felt that it was a
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:58.840]   difficult matter to handle. That is why he varies his comparisons and his
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.960]   various metaphors. The commonest of all his pictures, I say, is the one we are
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.920]   looking at this morning of the church as the body of Christ. But it isn't the only
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:15.040]   one. We will find in the next chapter that he compares the church to a building.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.920]   Jesus Christ himself is the chief cornerstone, the apostles and prophets of
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.180]   the foundation, and the building goes up. But then he also compares it to a
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:31.140]   household, to a family. We are members, he says, of the household of God. You see
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:37.320]   another idea. He then compares it to a great empire. As he was a prisoner in
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.980]   Rome, it suddenly seems to have occurred to him that the Christian church is in
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.960]   many respects like the Roman Empire. There is the great central seat of
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.320]   authority, but she has her people scattered throughout the world and her
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.840]   various officers and so on. The church is like a great empire. A wonderful picture.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:01.040]   But then you remember at other times he compares the church to a bride, and the
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.280]   relationship between Christ and the church is that between the bridegroom
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:10.160]   and his bride. And you remember how our Lord himself in that 15th chapter of the
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.520]   gospel, according to St. John, puts his doctrine in terms of the picture of the
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:22.840]   vine and the branches. Well now, all these pictures are simply designed to enable us
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:29.120]   to have some understanding of our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:35.680]   and especially here, that we may see how that power that is in him comes into us
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:42.440]   and enables us to live the Christian life, and is our guarantee and our
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.960]   assurance that we are going to enter into the possession of the purchased
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:53.160]   possession. Now that's the context. So that I'm not calling your attention to
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.600]   the doctrine of the church in a kind of theoretical or academic or detached
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:03.640]   manner, I am interested in it as we must be in this context, in order that we may
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.920]   see how this exceeding great power of God, how the energy of the strength of
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:15.240]   God's might really does operate in us. Very well, this is the way to do it, says
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.680]   the Apostle. We have to realize our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.640]   What does this picture of the body tell us? Well, let me extract hurriedly this
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:34.080]   morning certain principles. The first I find is this, and I think you will see
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.200]   that it is a principle that is common to all the illustrations and metaphors
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.920]   that are used in this New Testament attempt to convey the doctrine of the
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:51.640]   church to us. The first is that we are joined to Christ, that we are united to
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:13:00.600]   Christ. And let me hurry to emphasize this, we are united and joined to Christ,
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:09.520]   not in a mechanical manner, not in a loose manner, but in an organic manner, in
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:16.840]   a vital manner, in a most intimate manner. Now this is, of course, the very essence
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:25.400]   of this doctrine. Take it in terms of the body. Now the body, if you like, you can
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:35.120]   think of as a gathering of a number of parts, fingers, toes, arms, legs, and so on.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   But the whole point, of course, about the body is that the body is not a number of
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:47.320]   loose parts which are somehow or another just attached to one another. The whole
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.360]   secret of the body is that all the parts are really one, that they are an organic,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:59.800]   essential and vital unity. Now, to put it very crudely and bluntly, in order to
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:05.600]   make the thing plain and clear, my fingers are not joined to the palm of
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:12.040]   my hand by string, they're not just tied on. No, no, it's a living connection, it's a
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.640]   vital connection. There is a sense in which you can't tell me exactly where
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:21.600]   the palm ends and the finger begins. They're parts of one another. The
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.680]   connection is so intimate and organic and vital and living, that there isn't a
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:32.720]   clear-cut division. And they're not, I say, merely strung together somehow,
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   anyhow. Now, that is the essential and the first great principle which we must lay
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:47.160]   hold of, if we are truly to grasp this doctrine of the Church. It's a point, I
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.240]   say, which comes out in the other metaphors and comparisons also, but it is
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.840]   particularly clear here in the case of this analogy of the body. I mustn't press
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:03.660]   it too far, but it does seem to me that we are entitled to say this, that as the
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.720]   various parts of my body are developed out of the original cell from which we
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:15.360]   all begin, in that sense, every one of us who is a member truly of the Christian
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.000]   Church and is truly born again, is an offshoot of Christ, if you like, is a
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.720]   development out of Christ. We have come out of him. We are not merely loosely
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:31.760]   attached to him. Now, this is vital to the whole idea of the Church. Indeed, the
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.440]   Apostle in his first epistle to the Corinthians tells us that it's done in
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:46.560]   this way. He says, "For we are all baptized by one spirit into one body." It is a
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:53.840]   spiritual unity. It is a mystic unity. It is something, therefore, which is
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:16:00.960]   indissoluble because it is vital and organic. Now, there are many things we
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.880]   could say about this, but there are certain things which are simple and
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:11.000]   obvious. It is patently, therefore, not something that you and I do. It is not
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.400]   something which we can bring into being. We are back again, you see, at this
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.520]   fundamental thought, that it is indeed the action and the power of God. It is
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:27.640]   the work of the Holy Spirit, and that alone really makes us Christian. Or, let
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:33.720]   me put it like this. This relationship of the believer to Christ is not something
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:40.320]   organic. It is not something which is spasmodic. It isn't something which may
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.960]   exist today and not exist tomorrow. It isn't something that depends upon our
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.640]   concentration. As it is the work of the Spirit, and as it is something that is
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.360]   done by him in his own way, it is something that is permanent. And,
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.840]   therefore, we mustn't conceive of this relationship as one which can be broken
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.720]   tomorrow and then re-established. You can't go in and out of the body of
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.260]   Christ. There is no such thing as falling from grace, in a final sense. You can
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:16.120]   backslide, you may be excommunicated from the Church, but if you are in the body of
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.800]   Christ, you are in the body of Christ, and you will certainly remain in the body of
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:29.240]   Christ. It is organic, it is vital, it is spiritual. But now, let us move to a
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:35.440]   second principle, which is emphasized here particularly by the Apostle. The
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.320]   Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church. You notice how he puts it, and he
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.480]   says that God hath put all things under his feet, and gave him, Christ, to be the
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:52.160]   Head over all things to the Church, which is his body, the fullness of him that
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:59.240]   filleth all in all. Now, this is notoriously a difficult statement to
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.720]   expound, and there are many different views with regard to its exact
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.360]   interpretation. Let me just try to put to you things, I think, of which we can be
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:16.320]   absolutely certain. When he says that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:23.080]   Church, the Head of the body, he is not thinking so much here of authority or of
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.280]   government. Of course, that is perfectly true. Christ as Head of the Church is the
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.840]   sole authority, and we recognize no other authority. There is no Head of the Church
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.860]   but the Lord Jesus Christ, and it is of the essence of the Reformed position to
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:43.240]   assert that. We recognize no human being as the Head of the Church. Christ alone
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.920]   is the King and the Head of the Church, and he alone. But here I say that is not
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.800]   the thing that the Apostle is really emphasizing. He really is concerned to
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:19:02.240]   say this, that Christ as the Head of the Church is the source and the center of
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:11.000]   the life of the Church. Now, come back again to this analogy of the body. The
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.840]   body is really the source and the center. Everything in the body really derives
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:24.480]   its life and its being from the head. I don't want to go into this too much in
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.360]   detail, but it does seem to me to be a proof of the divine inspiration of the
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:34.000]   Scriptures that the Apostle and others were led to use this analogy. They
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.440]   hadn't the knowledge that we now have of anatomy and of physiology, but the
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:44.800]   analogy is absolutely perfect. You see, there is not a part of my body but that
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:51.360]   it is controlled by nerves and by the nervous system. The life in every muscle
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.720]   and in every part is rarely conveyed to it by that nervous energy and power. Yes,
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:02.760]   but all the nerves ultimately can be traced back to the brain. The brain which
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.240]   is in the head is the center and the source and the control of the nervous
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:15.320]   energy of the whole of my body and of every part and particle of my system. Now,
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:21.000]   you notice the Apostle says that Christ is the head of the Church, and he is the
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.680]   head of the Church in that sense. We have no life apart from him. All the energy
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.640]   and the power comes from him. Let me put it negatively. We have no independent
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:39.000]   life as Christians. He is the vine, we are the branches. There is no such thing as
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.240]   branches without a vine. It all comes from him. John puts it like this, "Of his
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.600]   fullness of all we received and grace for grace." Very well then, here is a very
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:55.400]   important thing for us to grasp. The life of the whole of the body and every
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:01.640]   individual part comes from the head, and that is what is partly meant by saying
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:07.240]   that he is the head of the Church. Another obvious deduction, therefore, is
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:13.120]   this, that it is the same life which is in every single part and portion of the
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:20.040]   body, and it is that, of course, which gives unity to the body. That is why a
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:26.440]   man's body is a single unity. Because of this intimate connection, because of this
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.880]   interrelationship, there is no such thing as an independent existence. They are all
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.280]   bound together. They are all made sensitive to one another because of this
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:42.920]   organic principle of unity. And therefore, at a time like this, when there is so
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:48.960]   much talk about the unity of the Church and the world Church, let us remember
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:55.520]   that you cannot have unity in terms of mere external organization. To amalgamate
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.520]   a number of denominations does not produce unity. There have been many
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.480]   attempts at that, and they never actually succeeded. But whether they succeeded or
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:09.200]   not in terms of organization, they cannot succeed spiritually. It is the Holy
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.680]   Spirit that makes the unity. It is this common life and energy that makes us one.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:20.600]   It is this essential living quality in the nervous system and in the blood, if
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.680]   you like, that flows around the whole body, that really accounts for the unity
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:32.360]   of a body. And it is exactly the same in the Christian Church. That a number of
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.520]   people may meet together in a conference and say, "Well, very well, for the sake of
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.480]   unity, I'll no longer emphasize the virgin birth." And another says, "I'll no
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.080]   longer emphasize the substitutionary atonement." The other says, "I'll no longer
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.680]   believe in miracles in order that we can arrive at a common denominator." That's
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:56.200]   not unity. The only unity is a unity in the Spirit, a unity which is made by the
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.880]   Spirit and dictated by Him, and is sustained and maintained by Him, the
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:07.160]   truth as the Spirit reveals it, and not as men decide upon some common
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:13.920]   denominator. Very well, that's a second deduction. But let us go on to something
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:20.080]   which is still more thrilling, which is this. The church which is His body, the
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:29.240]   fullness of Him that filleth all in all. What does that mean? Well, it means this.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:39.320]   He fills the body with His life. Now, you remember in many places in the Scripture,
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.920]   we are told that in the Lord Jesus Christ was all the fullness of the Godhead,
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:53.240]   bodily. In the Son is the fullness of the Father. And here we are told that in the
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.040]   same way and by the same analogy, the fullness of the Son is in the church,
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:06.840]   which is His body. Now, I think the analogy puts it quite plainly. There is a
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:15.560]   sense in which every part of me is full of the whole of my life. What is my life
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:20.320]   and being is in every part of my body. Indeed, the moment that ceases to be the
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:26.160]   case, any individual member will die. If you sever the nerve, if you sever the
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.360]   blood supply, well, that finger will no longer really be a vital part of my body.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:38.280]   The whole of my life is in every part. And that is the astounding thing that we
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.760]   are told about the Christian church and about ourselves as members of the
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:48.360]   Christian church. The church which is His body, the fullness of Him. His fullness is
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:54.720]   in her, of His fullness have all we received and grace for grace. The whole
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.040]   life of the vine is in the branch. It's all there in a sense and in another sense,
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:06.160]   of course, it isn't all there. But in this organic vital sense, it is all there.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:14.200]   So that we have to realize, beloved Christian people, however much we may be
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.480]   conscious of our weakness and of the strength of sin within us and without,
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.160]   and the world and the flesh and the devil, let us remember that all the
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:29.000]   attributes and the powers and the graces of the Lord Jesus Christ are in us as
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   members of His body. All this life is in us. We are partakers of the divine nature.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:47.840]   Or to put that in a slightly different form, let me put it like this. He is the
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:57.800]   source of all power in us, the members. He gives us the energy that is necessary
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:03.680]   for us to play our individual parts. You see the picture, don't you? The body, well
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.280]   all right, it's one and yet there are these individual members. As Paul puts it
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.960]   in writing to the Corinthians, "Ye are the body of Christ and members in
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.920]   particular." And the fingers have one function and the nose has another, the
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.920]   eyes and the ears and the various parts of the body, they all have their
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.360]   individual parts to play. There are comely parts and less comely parts, but
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.720]   they all are essential, they all work together to the one common end, and so it
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:39.120]   is with the Church. But the thing we have to remember is that as we are thus made
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.200]   members of the mystical body of Christ and have our parts to play and our
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:50.840]   functions to perform, the energy and the power that is necessary is there. It's
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.600]   there by very definition. You can't be in him without its being there. You can't
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:02.480]   be joined to him without its flowing into you. So that all the energy and the
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:08.080]   strength and the sustenance that we each must have to fulfill our function is
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:17.960]   provided by him. He said that himself, didn't he? "Without me," he said, "you can do
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:28.080]   nothing." We can exercise activities, but that isn't doing his work. We can be very
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.120]   busy and bustling, but it isn't spiritual work, and in the end it doesn't
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.120]   count at all. You remember there is teaching to this effect that some people
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.160]   are building, putting up a building, and they're putting in wood and hay and
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.880]   stubble. It looks as if it's a good building, but when the testing time comes
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:50.800]   it'll be entirely burned and destroyed. The work that is of value, the work that
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:56.880]   lasts, is the work that he and he alone enables us to do. And the point of the
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.840]   picture is that the energy is there. It is always available. Without him we can
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:08.120]   do nothing. With him all things are possible. So that we say with Paul, "I can
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:14.920]   do all things through Christ which strengthens me." Now all that I say is
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:23.320]   implicit in the idea that the Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the church. So that
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:29.000]   as you and I contemplate life and all its difficulties, and as we attempted of
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.160]   Satan to say, "Oh, it's impossible. I just can't go on. The thing is too much for me.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.080]   I'm so weak." And there are those baffling difficulties. The moment you
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:44.480]   attempted like that, you remind yourself and say, "I'm a very small member and I'm
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:53.000]   an unimportant member. But I am a member of the body of Christ. I am in him, and
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.800]   because I am in him, and though I'm small and insignificant, the
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:06.040]   life of the head is in me. I am related to that nerve center. I'm in touch with
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:13.640]   him. His vitality is in me, however small and insignificant I may chance to be."
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:19.360]   Now that is the thing that the Apostle wants us to understand, you see. He wants
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.200]   us to have the eyes of our understanding enlightened, that we may know the
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:29.680]   exceeding greatness of his power in us that believe. So we mustn't think
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.120]   of it as some kind of a great powerhouse to which you can occasionally be
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:40.240]   connected and sometimes not connected by a switch. No, no, he says, you are always
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:45.920]   in him. You are members of his body. He is head and you are member, and there is
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:51.880]   this vital indissoluble connection. So that in your weakness and your
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:57.080]   hopelessness, you have your eyes open to this truth, and you take fresh courage,
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:02.080]   and you take up your task again, and you go on and you say, "In Christ I cannot
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:08.480]   fail. I mustn't fail. He will not allow me to fail." You remember this unity of
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:16.120]   yours with the head and all its power. But now I want to go on to another
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:23.920]   principle, which in a sense I almost hesitate to say, and yet I believe one
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:30.160]   is entitled to say it. The church which is his body, the fullness of him that
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.400]   filleth all in all. What does it mean by saying the fullness of him that filleth
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:40.520]   all in all? Well, I've just given you one interpretation of that. That his
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:47.720]   fullness is in the church, the body. But I believe that they are right to say that
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:56.040]   it also means this, and it's a staggering thought, that there is a sense in which
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:04.960]   we as the church are his fullness. Now let's be clear about this. The Lord Jesus
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:10.600]   Christ as the eternal Son of God is eternally independent and separate, and
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:16.440]   doesn't need us, and in no sense are we his fullness or his completeness or his
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:24.440]   complement. But if you think of the Lord Jesus Christ as the mediator, as the
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:30.240]   God-man, as the one who has come to achieve redemption and to present his
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   people to his Father, well then I say in that sense he is joined to the body, and
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:46.720]   a head alone is not complete. A head needs a body. You cannot think of a head
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:54.600]   without a body. So the body and the head are one in this mystical sense, and in
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:32:00.720]   that sense you and I, beloved Christian people, are a part of the fullness of the
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:06.440]   Lord Jesus Christ. And this is a marvelous New Testament conception of
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:12.320]   the church. What is happening during the ages? What has been happening since the
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.680]   Lord Jesus Christ was on earth and has returned to heaven? Well in one sense
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:22.880]   it's this. This body of his is being perfected. Think of a newborn babe. In a
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.160]   sense the child is perfect at once, but it can grow and develop and it's going
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:33.000]   to attain into a certain maturity. That's equally true of the Christian church.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   What is happening until the second advent is that the body of Christ is
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.300]   growing and is being made perfect. There is a day coming when it will be
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.920]   absolutely perfect. The fullness of the Gentiles will have come in. All Israel
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:56.340]   will have been saved, and then the body will be complete and entire. So that in
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:01.880]   this astounding and amazing manner I've got to think of myself humble and
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:07.400]   unworthy insignificant Christian as I am, as someone who is essential and vital to
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:17.600]   the fullness of the mystical body of Christ. What an idea. And it is only as we
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.040]   grasp that idea that we'll be given strength not to sin. We will see sin in a
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:30.960]   new light. Are you a member of this mystical body in sin? Impossible. And yet
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.040]   you see that is what we are guilty of. There is no way which leads so directly
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:40.200]   to holiness and sanctification as to understand this New Testament doctrine
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:47.520]   of the church as the body of Christ. We are a part of his fullness, of his
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:55.400]   mystical completeness as the mediator, as the one given to the church by God as
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:03.200]   the head. But let me come on to some final conclusions. Here is one of the
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:09.600]   most glorious of all. In view of the fact that the church is the body of Christ
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:18.960]   and he is the head, we are entitled to say that what is true of him is true of
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:27.840]   us. And of course the New Testament tells us that. The finest exposition of this is
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.560]   to be found in the fifth and sixth chapters of Paul's epistle to the
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:42.440]   Romans. As we were all in Adam, so we are all in Christ who believe in him. Adam
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:47.840]   sinned, we all sinned with him. That's a vital part of this doctrine of the unity.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:53.440]   We were all in Adam. We were in the loins of Adam, if you like. We were all there
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:58.520]   in Adam and when he acted, he acted for us all. We are responsible for his sin,
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:06.480]   that is original sin. Yes, but we are looking at the other side. We are in
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.680]   Christ. Christ is the head of the body of which we are the parts. Whatever the head
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:18.320]   does, the whole body does. So what is true? Well, this is true. I have been
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:26.160]   crucified with Christ. When he was crucified, I was crucified. My old men, my
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.920]   Adamic nature has been crucified. I, the man born in sin, have died with Christ. I
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:40.600]   am as dead as he is in that sense. I am dead to sin. I am dead to the law. It
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:51.440]   can't touch me. I have finished it. Crucified with him, died with him, buried
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.800]   with him. Yes, and the thing that the Apostle emphasised here so wonderfully,
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:03.760]   risen with him. Even as this power of God raised Christ from the dead, he raised me
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:09.720]   with him. And therefore the Apostle argues like this, "If he then be risen with
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.080]   Christ, set your affections on things which are above, not on things which are
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:20.440]   on the earth. Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God."
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:27.680]   You see, it follows inevitably in the light of this wonderful doctrine. And as
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:33.720]   we shall find when we come to the second chapter, the Apostle actually tells us
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.640]   that we are already seated in the heavenly places with the Lord Jesus
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.960]   Christ. Listen to him, "Even when we were dead in sins, he hath quickened us
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.200]   together with Christ. By grace he has saved, and hath raised us up together, and
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:55.200]   made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus." We are there
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.480]   already because of our mystical union, because he's the head, we are the body.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:11.600]   What is true of him is true of us. Do you believe that? Are you living in the
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:17.360]   daily consciousness of that? Is this to you the most exhilarating thought you've
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:24.840]   ever met? It's true. This is not mere theory, this is fact. We are already in
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:32.760]   Christ in all those respects. We have finished with the law that condemns. We
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:38.520]   have finished with the death that finally leads to perdition. The second
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:44.360]   death, so-called. We have no relationship to it because we are in Christ, and
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:51.320]   risen with him, and seated in the heavenly places with him. And that brings
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.480]   me to my final thought for this morning.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:03.400]   There are many who are often perplexed and in difficulties with regard to the
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:12.000]   exact relationship of the Lord's working in us, and our working. I suppose there is
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.320]   no doctrine that has so confused people as the doctrine of abiding in Christ. And
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.200]   for some time it has generally been represented in a form which is almost
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   entirely passive. People have used illustrations you remember about the
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:35.320]   swimming belt, and the life-saving apparatus, and so on. And that to abide in
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.440]   Christ is to put on the swimming belt, and you're held up by him, and you do
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.320]   nothing. He does everything. Let go, let God. Now there is this constant
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:52.080]   confusion between these two matters. But it seems to me that this analogy, this
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:57.000]   metaphor of the church as the body of Christ, should really save us from all
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.160]   confusion, and enable us to see the relationship between his working and our
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:08.120]   working. Now take that statement in the second chapter of Philippians, in the
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:14.520]   13th verse. "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:20.720]   that worketh in you, both to will and to do." Now there are some people who seem
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.920]   to think it's like this. They say if you want to have victory in your life, you
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.360]   mustn't do anything at all. The mistake you make is you do too much. You're too
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.160]   active. They say you must do nothing but look to Christ. He'll do it for you. He'll
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:36.520]   do it in you. Now I want to show you that that is surely very erroneous teaching,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:42.080]   because there is this specific command, "Work out your own salvation with fear
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.440]   and trembling, because it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do."
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:55.640]   How does it work? Well now let's come back to this illustration. Think of a
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:04.920]   muscle, or if you like, think of a group of muscles in a man's arm. Now there in
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:12.820]   every muscle there is life and there is power. It is supplied, as I've already
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:18.560]   suggested to you, by the nerve that comes to it. Originally coming from the center
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:23.680]   in the brain, that nerve goes to that muscle, and its business is it to give it
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:31.720]   energy and power and strength and might. Now then, this is what we have seen from
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:39.360]   our analogy, the muscle is not isolated. It cannot do anything in and of itself.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.320]   But there it is, it's alive, it's receiving its life and its energy and
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:51.160]   its power, but it's flabby and it's weak and it can do practically nothing. Now the
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:57.800]   problem is how is that muscle to become strong? What can be done to give power
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.240]   and ability to that muscle, or that group of muscles, so that a man can lift up an
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:08.960]   enormous weight? Isn't it quite obvious? What you really have to do is, this is to
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:15.720]   exercise the muscle. You don't, as it were, wait for some great accession of power to
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:20.560]   come into the muscle. If you want to develop a muscle, the thing you do is to
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:26.780]   exercise the muscle. And the more you exercise the muscle, the more will be the
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:31.560]   energy and the power that will be supplied to it, so that the two things
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.100]   work together at one and the same time. You mustn't say that it's all from the
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:40.640]   brain, or that it's all in the muscle. It is the muscle making use of the power
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:48.680]   that it's got, and as it uses that, more will come. Now surely this is the whole
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.960]   truth about our Christian life and warfare, about our development, about our
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:42:01.600]   growth in holiness and in sanctification. The two extreme schools are patently
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:06.240]   quite false and quite wrong. Those who think that they do everything alone in
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.580]   the Christian life are wrong, and those who say that you've got nothing to do
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:16.720]   but just look to Christ and wait for him to do it are equally wrong. Because the
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.880]   church is the body of Christ and every single part and muscle and portion is
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:27.920]   vitally connected to him. He is the life of all, every Christian has got this
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:35.720]   power in him. And we must exercise the power, and as we exercise the power, we
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.840]   will inevitably be receiving more power. And as we exercise that, we'll get still
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:49.920]   more. And as we go on and on, we shall be invincible. So if there is any Christian
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:57.600]   listening who feels that he or she is defeated, the thing for you, my friend, is
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:04.560]   not just to pray that you may have strength and power, no, resist the devil.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:10.520]   Mortify your members which are on the earth. Don't expect the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.920]   to take your lusts and passions out of you. Don't expect to do it all for
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:21.360]   you while you sit back with folded arms and look on with admiration. Not at all.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:29.520]   Exercise the power that is in you. As a Christian, the life of Christ is in you.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:36.520]   Begin to use it and to exercise it. Make use of that muscle. Mortify sin, mortify
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:42.040]   your members, mortify these instruments that have been used by sin. Do all you
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:50.280]   can with all your might. And as you are doing it, increased power and energy will
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:57.160]   be flowing into you. Now this is pure physiology, but it is absolutely true
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:03.720]   spiritually. It's as true in the spiritual realm as it is in this natural
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:10.800]   or material realm. The way to receive more power is to use and exercise the
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.000]   power you have. You are not lifeless as a Christian. You are connected to the
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.200]   head. The nervous power is there. You say, "My muscles are flabby." I say, "Well, get at it.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:27.280]   Exercise them. Do it. Don't wait for some great blessing. Go on. Do your all and the
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:31.600]   blessing will come. You'll be conscious of greater power and the Lord will
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:37.160]   reveal himself to you in the power and the wonder and the amazement of his
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:45.000]   authority and his might. Very well, we leave it at that for this morning. God
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   willing, I hope to complete our consideration of this picture next
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.320]   Sunday morning. But I do trust that we are all carrying away in our minds this
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:05.440]   central conception, this exceeding great power of God, this energy of the strength
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:15.400]   of God's might is in me because of my relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:21.840]   who is the head of the body of which I am a part. It is in me. There is no excuse
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:28.120]   for my sin. There is no excuse for failure. The energy is there. I must use
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   it. I must exercise it. And I shall find then that there is infinitely more and I
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:42.960]   shall go on from strength to strength, from glory to glory until eventually I
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:50.560]   with all other Christians shall attain unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:59.560]   the stature of the fullness of Christ himself. May God by the Holy Spirit
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:10.600]   enlighten the eyes of our understanding that we may know that we are members of
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:16.240]   his body. Amen.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:24.040]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
