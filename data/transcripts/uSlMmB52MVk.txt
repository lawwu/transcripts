[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.240]   - Welcome back to a new week of episodes,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.200]   along with the Christmas episode queued up for Wednesday,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.420]   just the season.
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.000]   But today we talk ethics, Pastor John.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.440]   What do you say to those who hold
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.120]   to a trajectory hermeneutic?
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.360]   Proponents of this view would say something like this.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.280]   Sure, we read in the epistles that women cannot lead churches
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.260]   but that was only temporary.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.220]   Paul had close associates in the ministry that were women,
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.040]   therefore Paul's embrace of women as ministry associates
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.240]   really sets a trajectory that should develop over time
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.160]   and lead the church to later embrace
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.440]   the ordination of women.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.440]   That's just one issue.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.840]   Other issues are used like slavery and homosexuality.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.240]   The question really is then, in other words,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.840]   are the ethics of the New Testament final
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.680]   or are New Testament ethics to be interpreted as undeveloped
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.800]   and moving along a trajectory we must follow out
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.860]   and find apart from the New Testament text?
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.300]   - Yeah, this is a pretty sophisticated issue
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.300]   so hold on to your hats and let me give a stab at it.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.780]   The gist of this view is that we can identify
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.940]   a state of affairs as ideal or different
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.660]   from what is presented in the New Testament
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.880]   as ideal or normative, at least presently,
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.880]   and then justify going in a different direction
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.660]   than the New Testament because of clues in the Bible
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.420]   that we should do things differently than the Bible teaches.
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.640]   That's the gist of it.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.440]   And I have, the main issues are the role of women
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.840]   in slavery but others as well.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   I have three questions to pose to those who are toying
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.040]   with this way of treating the Bible.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.040]   Number one, does the ethical issue in question,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.680]   or maybe I should say doesn't the ethical issue in question
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.860]   become a wax nose that can be shaped by one's preference
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.200]   without giving decisive authority to the Bible?
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.640]   Doesn't this way of handling the Bible
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.440]   let the interpreter decide what state of affairs
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.520]   he wants the church and the world to move toward
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.120]   on the trajectory, where are we going?
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.240]   Well, he knows where we're going.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.240]   The interpreter in this view is deciding
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.600]   where we ought to go and then say
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.560]   that the New Testament teachings
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.280]   are not that state of affairs
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.400]   but are a stepping stone on the way there.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.560]   In other words, if you use the word trajectory,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.520]   you are assuming you know where we should be,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.880]   where we should be heading beyond the New Testament.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.320]   Now, how do we know what this is
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.000]   since it's not in the New Testament?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.640]   It seems to me that such a way of doing ethics
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.140]   will lead to a kind of subjectivity
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.140]   that lets me make my ethics in some ways
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.140]   pretty much what I want to make of them,
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.800]   which is another way of saying that this hermeneutic
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   seems to effectively strip the Bible of its final authority.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.680]   So that's my first concern.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.240]   It isn't a trajectory hermeneutic
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.080]   presuming that I can decide what that goal should be
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.260]   and thus shape it after my image
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.920]   rather than any authoritative image in the Bible.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.600]   Second, if the issue of roles of women and men
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.560]   are one of the key issues, which they are,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.160]   where this approach seems to be illuminating,
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.160]   isn't it strange that Paul would argue his points
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.440]   in ways that make it hard to use this trajectory approach?
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.600]   Here's what I mean.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.400]   This approach would say that Paul's instructions
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.480]   about men and women in the church, in marriage,
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.700]   are pointers to something
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.120]   beyond his own explicit instructions.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.080]   In other words, Paul wants us to see his instructions
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.500]   as temporary and illustrative of liberation,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.080]   not permanent and of normative value for all time.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.440]   But if that's what Paul or God, in inspiring Paul,
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.120]   wanted us to think,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.040]   that's the way they wanted us to think about things,
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.020]   it seems strange that the way Paul would argue
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.600]   for his position was in a way
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   that is not culturally conditioned or temporary.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.720]   In other words, Paul did not say
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.500]   that women should submit to their husbands
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.940]   because that would help them fit into the culture better
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.840]   so that in a later, more liberated time,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.120]   they would fit in better another way.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.120]   Instead, he argued that this dynamic of husband and wife
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.680]   leadership and submission was rooted in a relationship
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.920]   between Christ and the church,
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.920]   which God had signaled in creation back in Genesis 2,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.080]   and was now being worked out in the expression
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.920]   of the way Christ related to his church.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.240]   That's a really strange way to argue
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.560]   if you want people to take it
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.900]   in a different direction someday.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.780]   When Paul argued for men being in authority
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.440]   as teachers and elders in the church,
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.920]   he didn't argue by saying,
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.200]   now this will help you convert people better
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.120]   because they won't have to make so many adjustments
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.640]   in their patriarchal culture
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.920]   because they can come in here and see
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.480]   that men are in charge,
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.200]   but later in another culture,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.880]   it would help you convert people another way.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.720]   He just never argued like that.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.220]   He argued in 1 Timothy 2, 12, and 13
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.140]   that these dynamics are rooted in creation
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.900]   in the way Adam and Eve related to one another in the fall.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.900]   So both of these, marriage and church,
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.260]   are ways of arguing for marital role distinction
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.900]   and church role distinction
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.180]   that are simply not what you would expect
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.380]   if God's intent or Paul's intent
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.400]   was that his way of presenting things
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.940]   was to signal to us that we should get on a trajectory
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.200]   and go in a different direction
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.860]   than the way he was ordering marriage and church life.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.900]   That's my second concern.
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.900]   Here's the last one.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.460]   I would ask, did Paul treat slavery,
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.660]   well, slavery is the really hot one, I think,
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.220]   did Paul treat slavery
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.620]   the same way he treated the roles of men and women?
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.120]   Did he root in creation or in redemption
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.060]   the ongoing validity of the institution of slavery?
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.700]   Or let's ask it another way.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.940]   What did Paul say was normative
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.900]   in regard to slavery in the New Testament?
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.220]   And isn't the answer something like this?
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.220]   He did not treat the institution of slavery as normative
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.940]   or as desirable or as right in the way it functioned.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.560]   Paul did not say that slavery,
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.400]   as it has existed in his day or in most of history,
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.360]   and especially in America,
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.160]   was the way Christians should relate to each other.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.160]   In other words, you don't need a trajectory hermeneutic
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.520]   to see in Paul that slavery is not the way it should be.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.480]   Paul said, 1 Corinthians 7, "Don't be enslaved to anyone.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.180]   "Take your liberty if you can have it."
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.780]   Masters, don't threaten.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.300]   You have a master in heaven.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.740]   Master Philemon, "Receive your former slave,
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.940]   "no longer as a bondservant,
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.100]   "but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother."
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.260]   In other words, when it comes to slavery,
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.460]   what's controversial about Paul, really,
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.580]   is not that he was pro-slavery,
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.020]   but that he was pro-submission to slave masters.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.240]   Now, that's an issue that's gotta be wrestled with.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.860]   Where and when should that be applied,
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.240]   and should it not be?
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.360]   In other words, his approach to undoing slavery
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.720]   in his situation is not the path of violence
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.720]   or the path of rebellion.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.200]   It was another path.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.600]   But there's no need for a trajectory hermeneutic
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.680]   to move beyond the New Testament
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.720]   as if the New Testament celebrated slavery
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.900]   as the way things should be.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.520]   So, those are my three suggestions for consideration.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.760]   Number one, the problem of subjectivity
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.920]   in determining where this supposed trajectory is going.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.100]   Number two, the way Paul argues from creation
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.320]   and from Christ, not culture,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.820]   if he's supposed to be putting us on a trajectory.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.960]   And three, the way he does not do that,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.360]   does not argue that way with regard to slavery,
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.520]   but points to the flaws of an institution
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.740]   that was not the way it should be.
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.600]   - Outstanding, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.240]   And there's a very good introduction to this theme
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.080]   in the Southern Baptist Journal of Theology.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.680]   It's a review article titled,
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.680]   "Slaves, Women, and Homosexuals, a Review Article,"
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.920]   which was written by Thomas Schreiner.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.760]   You can find it with a simple Google search.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.980]   Well, tomorrow we have a question, a great question,
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.760]   from a young podcast listener who wants to know,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.440]   how can I be sure my relationship with God is healthy?
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.720]   So important.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.300]   That's the next episode of the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.160]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.320]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.480]   (upbeat music)
