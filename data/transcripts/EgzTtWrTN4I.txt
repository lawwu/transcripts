[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   We apologise for the poor quality of the following recording.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.800]   This was due to a fault in the microphone lead at the time the original recording was made.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.400]   Although we have cleaned it digitally, I'm afraid some disturbance does remain.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.240]   And we hope that it doesn't spoil your enjoyment of this sermon by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.800]   are to be found in Paul's epistle to Titus.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.600]   In the second chapter, verses 11 to 14.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:40.040]   Verses 11 to 14, in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to Titus.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.200]   "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.200]   teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.920]   we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.400]   looking for that blessed hope in the glorious appearing of the great God
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.920]   and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us,
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.360]   that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.400]   and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.560]   I want to emphasize this evening, particularly verses 12 and 13.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   Teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.760]   we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.600]   looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.560]   or the appearing of the glory of the great God, our Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.280]   We come, in other words, to look at this mighty statement of the Scripture,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.840]   as those who attend here regularly Sunday by Sunday will realize,
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.040]   for the third time.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.120]   We've already looked at it on two previous Sunday evenings,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.520]   regarding it as a typical statement of the Christian gospel and of its central message,
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.160]   all of which, of course, is very prominent in the minds of all Christian people,
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.560]   and indeed, in a vague sense, in the minds of all others,
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.920]   during the period of Christmas, the season of Advent.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.200]   And we have seen from this statement that
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.040]   the first thing that the gospel calls upon us to do
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.440]   is to look at and to consider this blessed person.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.800]   This is Christianity, that the great God,
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.280]   the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.120]   has literally come down on earth to dwell amongst men.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.080]   He hath appeared.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.600]   So, the first invitation of the gospel is to ask us to look at him
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.040]   and to realize who he is, why he came into the world.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.600]   And then we saw, secondly, last Sunday evening,
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.000]   that the gospel asks us in particular to concentrate our attention
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.640]   upon his two comings into this world, his two appearings.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.000]   You remember, we saw that, first of all, we are asked to look back,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.480]   for he hath appeared. We look back and consider
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.000]   what happened on that first Christmas day,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.200]   what exactly was happening then, and its meaning and its purpose.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.280]   But we also saw that the gospel invites us to look
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.760]   at another appearing of the Son of God, the appearing that is yet to come,
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.840]   looking unto me, that blessed hope, and the appearance of the glory
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.240]   of our great God. And we contrasted the two comings, how he came the first time
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.200]   in humility, how he abased himself, how he was born of a virgin in a stable
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.720]   and put in a manger, how he grew up as a little boy, how he
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.520]   worked as a carpenter for all those long silent years,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.240]   and all he did when he came and was despised and rejected of men,
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.880]   was called the friend of publicans and of sinners,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.680]   and how he died in apparent weakness. That's it, the first coming. The grace of
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.000]   God that bringeth salvation hath appeared, and that's how he did appear.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.360]   But there is this other coming, when he will come as the King of kings and the
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.960]   Lord of lords, riding the clouds of heaven,
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.720]   accompanied by the angels and the heavenly hosts,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.800]   through judgment, winding up the course of history,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.600]   and to the setting up of his eternal and everlasting kingdom.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.440]   Well now then, we've seen that the gospel invites us to those two things,
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.400]   but still you observe the gospel hasn't finished.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.440]   Having asked us not to look at him and to look at both his comings,
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.240]   it goes on and asks us to look at ourselves.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.040]   And that is the thing to which I want to call attention this evening.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.560]   Because the message of the gospel is not complete until it has
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.480]   asked us to look at ourselves. And it is because so many fail to
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.240]   realize that, that they never experience the benefits of the Christian gospel.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.880]   They are always looking out, contemplating it in an objective,
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.280]   purely and entirely and solely objective manner.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.920]   And they have never looked at themselves at all.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.000]   And I say the result is that they've never known and experienced
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.400]   the blessings of the gospel. For this is the extraordinary thing
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.880]   about this gospel, that it does these two things.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.040]   And as I've already indicated, men and women go wrong on the one hand and on
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.040]   the other. There are some people who start and end
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.920]   with themselves. They're not interested in anything
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.560]   except themselves and their own moods and states and feelings and conditions.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.720]   They want something and they start with this and they end with this.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.080]   And they've never seen the objective truth.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.560]   But there are others, as I say, who are so exclusively objective that they never
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   look at themselves at all. And the one class is in as hopeless a
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.120]   case and condition as the other class.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.040]   But the gospel itself does the two things.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.840]   And it never stops short of this. The gospel, as you find it in the New
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.640]   Testament, always applies itself. It never is
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.320]   content with just making a statement. It always goes on to the application of
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.720]   the statement. It pictures to us the glorious state
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.160]   which is awaiting us. But it doesn't just stop at that. It says,
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.520]   "He that hath this hope in him purifieth himself
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.560]   even as he is pure." Or take the instance that we had of it just now
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.680]   in that third chapter of the second epistle of Peter
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.600]   that we have read together. "Seeing we look for these things," says Peter,
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.360]   "what sort or kind of person should we be
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.120]   in all godliness?" Now that's typical of the gospel.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.200]   It doesn't just paint its picture and leave it at that. No, no. It says, "Now then,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.960]   there is the picture. What have you done about it?
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   How does this come to you?" And surely there is nothing better that
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.280]   we can do on the last Sunday night like this of an old ER.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.760]   Then just consider this question of the application of the gospel to
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.000]   us individually. The gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.760]   is something very personal.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:40.680]   And therefore I have to ask this question. How has this gospel come to you?
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.440]   You've been listening to it perhaps for a year or longer.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.840]   How has it come to you? What has it meant to you?
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.440]   Has it done anything to you? Has it made any difference at all
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.080]   to you? Well now, according to this statement here which is given us by the
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.680]   apostle, you notice that it is meant to do
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.960]   something very definite to us. And the way in which we test whether our
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.480]   listening to the gospel has been of any value or profit to us
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.440]   is to ask ourselves certain questions. The apostle makes that very plain by
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.840]   using this word "teaching." "The grace of God," he says, "that
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.520]   bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us."
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.600]   Now there is the central principle.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.800]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is not something
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.840]   which is simply meant to interest us or to entertain us.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:48.120]   Its primary object is to teach us. It's not something of a passing interest
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.960]   which we just are conscious of while we're in a church or a chapel and
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.160]   in the precincts perhaps. No, no. Its essential purpose is to teach us
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160]   something. And if the gospel hasn't taught us
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.640]   certain things, well then we've never really heard it.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.560]   The gospel is not just a matter of feeling.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.360]   The preaching of the gospel is not just designed to help us for an hour or so to
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.760]   forget our troubles and our problems. And while we're singing our hymns or
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.880]   whatever it is we sing, to feel a little bit happier than we've
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.600]   been. There are many people who make use of it like that.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.080]   They use it as a drug. It's a good thing, they say, to get away now and again
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.280]   from all the anxieties and the troubles of the modern world.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.720]   And it gives you a nice and a comfortable feeling to be singing the
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.480]   hymns and to be listening to these things. And that's it, that's all it means to
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.040]   them. It's something that makes them feel a little bit happier,
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.320]   makes them feel a little bit better. But if you proceed to ask them, well now
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.080]   very well, what exactly does it teach you? What does
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.120]   it tell you? What do you stand for? To what have you
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:59.240]   subscribed? They don't know. Well now, that is a
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.440]   complete failure truly to hear the gospel.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.520]   For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men,
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:14.200]   teaching us. Very well then, I make no apology for asking this question
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:21.960]   on this last Sunday night. Have you truly received this gospel?
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:29.080]   Have you really heard it? Has it really taught you something? Now
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:34.120]   there's a very simple way in which this can be tested.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.360]   Because according to the apostle, and according to the whole of the New
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.400]   Testament, when we have truly and really heard this
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.960]   gospel, it does two things to us.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:54.360]   The first thing it does is this, that all our views and ideas and our
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:01.080]   thinking become completely changed. And the second thing it does to us is
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.120]   this, that because our way of looking at
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   everything has become changed, of necessity, our way of living has
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:13.000]   become changed. Because what determines the way in which
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.480]   a man lives is the way in which he thinks.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.400]   If I see the way in which a man lives, I can tell you that man's philosophy of
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.800]   life. I can tell you what he thinks. As a man thinks, so he does.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.320]   And it doesn't matter which you look at. You listen to a man's philosophy and you
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.440]   can predict how he's going to live. Or if you look at his practice and you
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.640]   can deduce his philosophy. These things are inextricably mixed up
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.600]   together. And our lives and mode of living are
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.040]   nothing but an expression of the view which we take of life,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:55.480]   our theoretical attitude towards the whole of existence.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.840]   Now then, I want to consider these two things with you
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.880]   briefly this evening.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.800]   A man, I say, who has truly heard this gospel
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:14.120]   is a man whose views and way of thinking have been
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:20.920]   entirely changed. In what respects? Well, the first respect is
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.160]   this.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.240]   He's a man who has come to see his own extremely
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.600]   dangerous position.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.560]   Here he is, you see, he's been listening to the gospel. What has the gospel told
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:41.160]   him? Well, it has told him this. It has told him that at that given point
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.600]   in time, which separates B.C. from A.D.,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:53.880]   the Son of God appeared in this world. That's what it's told him. I've reminded
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.680]   you of that. It has told him that this great God, this
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.120]   second person in the blessed holy trinity,
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.840]   divested himself of the insignia of his eternal glory
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:15.080]   and was born in the likeness of sinful flesh. It's taught him that.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.240]   It has taught him, in other words, of this first appearing
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:25.160]   and of all that followed, that death upon the cross, the burial, and the
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.760]   resurrection. And then it has taught him about this
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.240]   second coming. That the day is coming as certainly as
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.880]   that first day came, when the Son of God will appear again.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.480]   And men will lift up their heads and they will see him.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.320]   Every eye shall see him, yea, and they that pierced him.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:50.280]   They'll see him riding on the clouds of heaven, not divested of the insignia this
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.520]   time, but in the full panoply and all the glory
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:00.280]   of the heavenly personage that he is. They will see him, the appearing of his
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.840]   glory.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.160]   Now that was what the gospel has taught them.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.800]   Ah yes, but as the gospel teaches him those things,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.600]   it inevitably is teaching him certain things about himself.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.680]   For any man who faces this gospel intelligently must go on to ask a
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.840]   question. Why did the Son of God appear in
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.640]   Bethlehem? Why is the Son of God going to appear
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.800]   again? Isn't that the obvious thing to ask
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.320]   intelligently? What is the meaning of these things?
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   What do they represent? What do they mean to me?
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:47.000]   Is all this to me just as if I were reading a novel?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.840]   I can pick up a novel and read about the hero and the heroine and all the things
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.200]   that happen to them. Yes, but the whole time I know that it
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.640]   really has got nothing at all to do with me. It's a form of entertainment.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.000]   It's a form of passing the time. Days are long. It's
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.200]   very difficult to know what to do with yourself on a Sunday. Well,
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.960]   reading a novel is a good way to help to pass away the time, but of course it
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.360]   means nothing to me. I may be gripped for the time being. The author may be so
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.600]   clever that I'm gripped for the moment and I
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.720]   feel it's real and I'm in it, but then I pull myself together and say,
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.440]   "What are you getting excited about? This is only a story.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.000]   This is all pure imagination." So whatever I may have felt, I put down the book. I
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   say, "Well, that's that. It was very good,"
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   and so on. But it's all outside me. It's got nothing to do with me,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.960]   but not so this.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:40.520]   For here I'm dealing with history. This isn't imagination. This isn't fantasy
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.240]   and fantasy. No, no, this is pure history. This is just
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.920]   a sheer record of things that have happened on the very field of
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.880]   history. As certainly as you and I are in this
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.760]   world, the son of God has been in it. And he was not only in it and he not
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.080]   only taught, but he died on that cross and he was buried and he rose
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.520]   again. I ask, "Why?
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.920]   What does this say to me? What's it got to do with me?"
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.320]   Now then, a man who's truly heard this gospel realizes at once what it's got to
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.560]   do with him. He says, "There is only one explanation of
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.120]   all this,
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.040]   and it is simply
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.800]   that the world was in such a state, and I
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.080]   was in such a state,
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.360]   that if I am to be redeemed and rescued and reconciled unto God and have a hope
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.760]   of heaven and glory, he hath to come."
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.720]   That's what it means.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.400]   His coming, his appearing the first time
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:56.440]   had but one object, and it was to save men. He said it himself,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.640]   "The Son of Man," he said, "has come to seek
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:05.640]   and to save that which is lost." How did the Son of God appear? I say the
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.400]   Son of God appeared for this reason, that the whole world lieth guilty before
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.160]   God, that there is none righteous, no, not one,
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:25.320]   that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. That's why he came.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.920]   He came because the whole of the human race had fallen in Adam
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.680]   and was under the wrath of God and under the condemnation of God's law.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.880]   And the whole of the human race was incapable of saving itself.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:45.720]   It had tried to do so. It had tried to do so with its philosophy and its politics
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.400]   and all its attempts at producing utopias.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.720]   It had tried to do so through the application of the law that God gave
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:19:02.520]   through Moses, but it had all failed. And that is why he came.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.640]   And then look at his second coming. What is he coming for?
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.480]   He is coming for judgment. He is coming to separate the sheep and the
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.160]   goats. He is coming to set up his kingdom, to
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.880]   destroy his enemies, and to pronounce an eternal sentence upon
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.560]   all who have not believed in him. Very well. That's the message of the
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.760]   comings of Christ.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.280]   And I say amen who listens to this message with any kind of spiritual
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.920]   intelligence. He is a man who immediately draws this
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.160]   deduction. He says to himself, "All this has happened
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.040]   and all this is going to happen because I'm a sinner,
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.760]   and my position is as precarious as this.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:20:01.560]   I was so sinful, I was so lost, I was so damned under the wrath of God
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:07.400]   that it needed the coming of the Son of God out of the courts of heaven
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:15.640]   into that virgin's womb and into this world, and to endure the
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:22.600]   contradiction of sinners against himself, and to go to that cruel cross with its
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:29.320]   shame and its agony and its suffering. My position before God was so desperate,
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.720]   so hopeless, that nothing but that, nothing less than
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.000]   that, could possibly save me. That's what he
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.520]   teaches me. This isn't a spectacle, this isn't a
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.280]   panorama, this isn't some great dramatic action.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.560]   No, no, this is literally fact, and it happened, I say,
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.720]   because my position was so desperate that nothing less than that
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:58.440]   could save me and reconcile me to God. He gave himself for us that he might
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.480]   redeem us from all iniquity, and separate unto himself a peculiar
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.920]   people, zealous of good works. My dear friend,
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.760]   in the name of God, I ask you this most solemn question
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.560]   on this last Sunday evening of an old year.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.160]   Had you ever realized the significance of Christmas
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:23.000]   for you? Had you realized that the Son of God came in that way and lived and
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.560]   died and rose again because it was the only way
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.000]   whereby your sins could be forgiven, and you could be
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.600]   reconciled to God, and you could be saved
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:41.400]   from eternal damnation and perdition? That's what he teaches.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.360]   Has he taught you this?
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:54.440]   Had you realized, had you believed, had you really known
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:01.240]   that it all took place because, without it,
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:08.280]   you were hopelessly lost and would be lost to all eternity, and outside the
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:13.800]   glory and the presence of God, and enduring a mental and spiritual
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.800]   torment that baffles description?
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.560]   That's what he teaches. That's what he teaches a man
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.080]   about himself. Tell me, as you've considered him,
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:31.480]   as you've considered his coming, his coming again, had you drawn the deduction?
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.960]   Had you said, "This isn't a mere display of God's love.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:42.680]   This is something that had to happen before I could be redeemed."
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.400]   There it is. That's the first lesson. But there is a second test which we can
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.680]   apply, and it's this one.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.360]   It not only enables me to see the truth about myself and my desperate and most
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.720]   precarious position,
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:07.320]   it also entirely changes my view of my life in this world, and indeed
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.040]   of the life of the whole of the world at this present time.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.400]   Had you ever considered that?
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.320]   I can tell you very simply whether you're a Christian or not, or whether
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:25.000]   you truly believe this gospel or not. What is your view of this present age in
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.480]   the world?
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.000]   Now here we are at the end of an old year, and we are facing the beginning of
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.080]   a new year. Well, what's it all mean? What is time?
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:41.160]   What's happening? What is history? What's the meaning of time? What is the
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.960]   meaning of what is happening round and about us in the world
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.040]   at this present moment? You know, your answer to that question will tell me
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:52.360]   very plainly whether you're a Christian or whether you're not.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.040]   For the apostle puts it here very plainly, did you notice?
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.520]   "Teaching us," he says, "that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.480]   we should live soberly, righteously, and godly
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.920]   in this present world."
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.880]   There it is. What's he mean? Well, he means this.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.560]   The moment a man becomes a Christian, the moment a man
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.200]   really understands the truth about the Lord Jesus Christ and his first coming
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.720]   and his second coming, it gives him an entirely new view of
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.120]   history. He understands the meaning of life in
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.360]   this world in an entirely new manner. What is it?
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.080]   Well, you know the view of the man who's not a Christian.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.360]   The man who's not a Christian is a man who believes that everything
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.800]   is really very wonderful,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.440]   that the world is moving forward and that the things that happen in the world
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.920]   are of tremendous importance and significance. Read his
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:02.440]   secular history books and you'll see his view of history, kings,
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.440]   battles, great emperors, great commanders,
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.600]   empires rising up, conquering, others rising up in turns and
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.360]   in turn and conquering. This is history. This is existence.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.000]   This is the meaning of it all. And coupled with all this, he's got the
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.360]   impression that somehow it is all, if very slowly,
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.480]   nevertheless, certainly and surely advancing in the
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:33.240]   direction of perfection. Mankind has got this belief in it,
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.120]   belief in it, that the world is somehow developing
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.680]   and advancing and going on and time therefore is so important.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.680]   Oh, they say you mustn't be impatient. You know, it takes a long time to improve
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.040]   things. It's a slow process, this reform, but you
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.480]   must be patient. Take a long view and you'll see the whole
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:57.080]   race is moving, it's developing. Mankind trusts to the passage of time
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.280]   and to the process of history to improve his world
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.960]   and to arrive ultimately at perfection. That is his belief.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.080]   That's his view of history.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:12.520]   But you know, that isn't the Christian view of history.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:20.920]   What is this present time? What is it? You notice what it is to the apostle Paul?
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.440]   All this history which we read in our books,
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.720]   all that we read in our newspaper at the present hour,
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.440]   what is it all? Well, according to Paul, it's this.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:37.880]   It is nothing but the interval between the two appearings of the Son of God.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.520]   That's history. It has no meaning and no significance apart from this.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.120]   What is this present time? It is simply this interval between
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.160]   the first time when he appeared and the second time
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.880]   when he'll yet appear. The Son of God hath appeared, the Son of God
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.280]   will appear. And what is history? It's just this gap, this interval between the
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:03.800]   two. And it has no meaning and no value
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:08.440]   whatsoever apart from that. Now that, I say, is the New Testament and
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.920]   the biblical view of time and of history. You notice he says that we should live
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:18.440]   soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. And by calling it
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.000]   present world, he tells us his view. Ah, he says it's a passing world. It's only
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   this present world. There's another world. And what is this present world? Well, it's
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.640]   just this that is here between that and that. He came, he'll come.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.480]   And this is just the interval. It has no meaning apart from that.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.320]   But wait a minute, says somebody, surely you're saying now that history has no
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.760]   meaning. Well, I am. And in a most interesting way,
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.800]   what I am saying on the basis of the New Testament
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.040]   is supported by some of your modern historians.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.080]   You see, you read a man like Arnold Toynbee and he'll tell you the same
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.320]   thing in his own way. He will tell you that rarely what happens
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.320]   in history is just a question of circles.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:08.120]   You read his monumental history and this is his theory.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.200]   There is one great nation building itself up and it attains to a position
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.040]   of dominance and of power. Yes, but he says the very fact that it
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.600]   does that provokes a response in another nation that is kept down by
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.680]   this first nation. And it begins to organize. And as the
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.280]   first nation becomes a little bit slack and indolent because it's attained to
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.720]   such great power, the other power takes advantage and it
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.320]   begins to grow and to develop. A day comes when it's strong enough to
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.720]   meet the first and it attacks it and it defeats it. This second power now
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.160]   becomes the great dominating power and it keeps others down.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.560]   But the others in turn begin to react against it and they begin to develop and
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.480]   on and on it grows. That's his whole view of history as you
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.160]   know. You see it all becomes rather
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:00.440]   meaningless, doesn't it? You climb and climb up the hill and then
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.000]   you reach a point when you begin to go down the other side
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.200]   and that's the whole of history going up and going down.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:12.200]   And it happens not only in a military sense, it happens in a political sense.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.560]   Please turn your cassette over at this point for the conclusion of this sermon
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.160]   by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:25.160]   [Dr Lloyd-Jones' Speech]
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:34.600]   It happens not only in a military sense, it happens in a political sense.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:39.640]   It happens in a social sense. Is there any intelligent person who would dispute
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.440]   my statement that we're living in an age of decadence
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.800]   at the present time? Compare today with a hundred years ago.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.240]   Look at your politicians of today and contrast them with those of a hundred
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.040]   years ago. Look at men in almost any walk of life.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.480]   Look at them in pulpits. What pygmies we are. We are in an age of
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.120]   declension.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.240]   But the fatal mistake that was made by so many thinkers a hundred years ago and
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.880]   especially at the end of the last century was
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.080]   that they assumed that this century was going to be higher and greater than the
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.200]   last. But it isn't.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.560]   We are in the stage of decline and fall.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:26.760]   As an empire, as a nation, politically, socially, morally, in every
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.800]   respect, religiously included. You see, that is what's happening. We
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.920]   make our fuss and excitement. We are interested in these great
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.360]   movements. Take a long view of history. What really happens? Nothing happens.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.680]   It's of no value at all. It is of no significance. The world is not moving
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.840]   forward. The world is not getting better. It's this forwards and backwards. It's
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.520]   this going round and round and round and round ever in
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.760]   the circle. And it leads nowhere. Ah, you see, the people are beginning to
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:03.400]   see that the bible is right after all. What is time? What is history?
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:09.640]   The only real significance to it, my dear friend, is this.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.720]   It is this interval between his first coming
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:19.320]   and his second coming. The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared,
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.920]   teaching us, looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of that
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.600]   great God. What is this time in which we live?
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.920]   What is the purpose and the object of it all? My dear friend, I can tell you it's
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:39.000]   this. It is simply this time
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.240]   that God, in his infinite grace and kindness and compassion,
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.680]   is giving to the ungodly. Didn't you notice how Peter put it there in that
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.960]   second epistle and in that third chapter? Listen, he says,
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.200]   "The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night."
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.800]   "But when's it going to come?" says somebody. "Ah," says Peter,
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.840]   "the Lord is not slack concerning his promises,
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:11.560]   as some men count slackness, but is long suffering to us all,
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:19.320]   not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:25.640]   "With God a thousand years, but as one day, and one day as a thousand years."
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.560]   "Give us a thousand years," says mankind, "and we'll show you what we can do."
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.880]   They've had nearly two thousand, and what have they done?
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.640]   They've done nothing that is of any value. It's all useless,
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:43.480]   and we're wasting our energy and our time. Here is the significance of time.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   God, in his long suffering to a sinful, evil, rebellious world,
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:55.320]   is granting yet another opportunity. Its only meaning is this.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:59.160]   It is the day of grace.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.320]   The day of grace began, in a sense, when he came,
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.760]   and when he bore our sins in his own body on the tree.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.080]   He introduced, he inaugurated the day of grace,
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.240]   and the day of grace is still continuing. It will continue
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.960]   until he comes back again to judge. And did you know the meaning of time?
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.480]   It's this. Not that the dollar position may improve,
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.400]   or the pound may improve. Not that this, or that, or the other may happen.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.160]   It's this. Have you realized it? This is my question.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:36.440]   The day of grace is here for you to have an opportunity of repenting
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.960]   and believing on the Son of God. God is allowing time to continue
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.040]   in order that you may believe, may repent and return,
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.560]   and acknowledge your sin, and accept his offer of salvation.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.720]   That's the meaning of time, the day of grace.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:34:00.120]   Thank God it hasn't ended, and it won't end because this is the last
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:06.040]   Sunday night in 1958. But my dear friend, it will end.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.120]   There is a day coming when it must end, when God will bring it to an end.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.640]   I'm asking you this question.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:20.120]   Have you realized that the real significance of the continuation of time
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.120]   is that you might have an opportunity in this day of grace
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:29.320]   to make your peace with God, and to accept his free offer of pardon,
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.600]   and of forgiveness, and of newness of life.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:39.480]   It's the day of grace. And the other thing that it represents is this.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:46.440]   It is this interval that God and the Lord Jesus Christ are using
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.360]   to prepare their own people for the glory that is coming.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:57.720]   "Who gave himself for us," says Peter, says the apostle here, "that he might
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:04.360]   redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:10.440]   a peculiar people, zealous of good works?"
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.800]   What's the meaning of history since Christ came
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:19.400]   nearly 2,000 years ago? I'll tell you its meaning.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:26.120]   Throughout all those long centuries, he has been calling out and gathering
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.720]   out a people for himself.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.560]   It began, you remember, by 3,000 coming in on the day of Pentecost.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.560]   It went on. And throughout the running centuries,
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.800]   he's been calling out his people. You know, I'm not interested in William
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.240]   the Conqueror and 1066. All that, it doesn't make any difference
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.120]   at all. What's it matter whether he'd come or whether he hadn't come?
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.880]   It doesn't make any vital difference. History is much the same in the end.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:55.080]   It arrives at a sort of average, and it's always the same thing.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:00.360]   But here is the significant thing, that in every age and generation, he's been
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.880]   calling out people, one here and another there, and they've
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.800]   been taken out of the world. They've been put
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.600]   into his kingdom, and this kingdom of his is being enlarged and extended,
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.440]   and built it up, and it's growing, and it's becoming a mighty kingdom.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.480]   There is a fullness coming into the kingdom of God.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.240]   That's the meaning of this age, this interval between the first coming
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.280]   and the second coming.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:30.360]   And his people are being prepared. They're being purified. They're being
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:36.520]   separated for that glory that is awaiting them.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:44.120]   Is that your view of time and of history? That's the Christian view. The moment a
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.760]   man realizes the truth of this message, he says to himself, "Nothing matters,
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:53.000]   except that I be right with God. I'm only in this world for a short number
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.760]   of years at the very best. The whole world is passing. It is only
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.840]   this present world, this present age. Eternity is coming.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.240]   That's the thing. This is only an interval."
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:11.960]   And whatever men may do or not do in this world, however much they may improve it,
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.280]   or however worse it may get, the only thing that matters is its relationship
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.680]   to God. Because though the world had reformed
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.120]   itself almost to perfection, it would avail it
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.160]   nothing in the day of judgment. For only one
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:32.760]   thing matters there, and that is that we are in Christ
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.840]   and citizens of his kingdom.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:44.920]   Is that your view of the world? Is that your view of time?
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:51.080]   Is that your view of history? It is the day of grace.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.920]   It is the day of salvation. It is God's interval,
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:59.880]   to whom a thousand years are but as one day, and one day as a thousand years.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.160]   Have you realized it and its meaning for you?
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.600]   There is still an opportunity for you. It is still
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:12.040]   the day of grace. Today is the day of salvation.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:17.240]   And then finally, under this heading, I must mention this.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:26.520]   This teaching not only makes me see myself in my own precarious position,
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.280]   it not only enables me to see the meaning of my life in this world and the
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.880]   history of the whole world, it entirely transforms my view of the
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:41.000]   future. Teaching us
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:47.640]   that we should look for the blessed hope
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.080]   and the appearance of the glory of the great
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:56.600]   God. Oh, what a test this is.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.480]   What's your view of the future, my dear friend?
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:07.400]   What are you pinning your hope to? Are you just trusting to the passage of
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.160]   time to make things better for you and for the world?
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:17.320]   What's your view of the future? What's your view of death?
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.440]   What's your view of the grave? What's your view of the appearing of the
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:28.120]   great God when he comes back, surrounded by the angelic hosts? What's
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.840]   your view of it?
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.240]   What would you feel like if he came back this evening and suddenly appeared in
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:40.040]   judgment over this city of London? How would you feel?
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.520]   That's the question.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:52.360]   And you see, at once the whole of mankind is divided into two groups.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.280]   There are those to whom this is nothing but terror,
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:02.200]   the greatest terror conceivable. They're terrified of death as it is, they're
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.840]   terrified of old age, many of them. And when they believe in this second
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:13.800]   coming, they're terrified, they're alarmed, and they have every reason for being.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:20.920]   They are the people who do not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:27.000]   But when a man does believe in him, he looks to the future in an entirely
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.400]   different manner. He expects nothing from the mere passage
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:36.040]   of time. But he does know that a day is coming
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.040]   when this Son of God will again appear,
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:47.640]   and he will destroy every vestige of evil and sin
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:53.640]   out of the entire cosmos. As Peter puts it, the elements will melt
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.240]   with a fervent heat, and there shall ultimately be a new heaven
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.600]   and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.840]   And this man, this Christian, believes that he shall be there.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.400]   He will see him. He'll be made like him. He'll share in his glory.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.000]   He'll live in this renovated earth. He looks for it.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.160]   He looks eagerly, expectantly, hopefully, confidently.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:26.920]   A Christian is not afraid of death. He's not afraid of the grave.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:32.680]   For death to a Christian just means going out of this world of sin
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:39.160]   and of shame and of unhappiness, of sorrow, of sighing, of parting
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:47.800]   to that land of pure delights where saints immortal reign.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:53.480]   But above all, I say, he looks to the coming of the Son of God at that great
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.640]   day when history shall be ended and when he'll come back in judgment
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.440]   and set up his kingdom. It's going to be a marvelous day
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.840]   for Christian people, despised at the moment, laughed at,
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.280]   jeered at, derided. The clever people of the world
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.640]   look down upon us, let them do so. There is a day coming
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.040]   when they'll be in torment and misery, and you and I shall shine forth
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:23.000]   in the glory of our Father and shall be participators
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.800]   in the endless joys and glories of eternity.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.480]   That's what this message teaches us. Teaching us is,
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.640]   Paul, not just a nice happy feeling, not some theoretical view about the
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.320]   philosophy of Christianity. No, no, but teaching us these specific
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.360]   things about ourselves. Have you viewed yourself dying? Have you
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.160]   viewed yourself appearing in an obituary column? You're
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.360]   going to be there, you've got to die, and then the judgment?
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:43:01.720]   Have you learned the way to be able to look at these things and smile at them?
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.560]   Perhaps you've even reached the stage at which you can say with the Apostle Paul,
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.840]   "To me to live is Christ and to die is gain,
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.240]   for it means to be with Christ, which is far better."
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.760]   This world is doomed, it's hopeless, it'll never be right.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.960]   It's this passing world, this present world,
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:24.920]   but there is that other world in which he dwells,
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.600]   and he's going to bring that new Jerusalem from heaven
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:36.360]   down onto this earth, and it will be glorious, baffling description.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:41.160]   Is that your view of the future? Well, you see, I've been showing you that
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:45.560]   when a man really understands this message, it changes all his views, his
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.760]   thinking, and all his ideas, and secondly, I say
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.000]   only a word about this because it's inevitable.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.320]   The second thing is that it inevitably changed his view,
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:04.200]   his way of living. Listen to the Apostle. "The grace of God that bringeth salvation
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:09.560]   hath appeared to all men." Teaching us what? That denying
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:18.040]   ungodliness and worldly lusts. We should live soberly, righteously,
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:24.760]   and godly in this present world, looking for that blessed hope and the
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:29.080]   appearing of the glory of the great God.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:34.600]   I'm not going to insult your intelligence by pressing this upon you.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.960]   What I'm saying is this.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:46.120]   If a man really believes what I've been saying,
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:51.400]   it follows inevitably as the night the day
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.160]   that he's going to do something about it.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:00.360]   If a man really believes that after death there is the judgment and that he
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.480]   stands before this holy God and will be tried by God's revealed
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.320]   holy law, if he really believes that the issue of
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.800]   that judgment is eternal and everlasting and that a man
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.200]   who is left to himself in his sin is inevitably condemned
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:23.320]   and goes to perdition, I say a man who believes this.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:28.840]   A man who believes these other statements of this great and glorious gospel
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:33.160]   is a man who needs no arguing. He needs no persuasion.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:39.960]   He's a man who says, "I must entirely forsake that perishing world, and I must
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.000]   turn and live this other type of life that
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.960]   has been held before me by the blessed Son of God."
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:52.360]   A man whose views have been changed, whose thinking has been changed,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:58.440]   is a man who says, "I'm going to leave on godliness once and forever."
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.720]   And godliness means living as if there were no God,
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:08.760]   making a God of yourself, making a God of the world, making a God of other people,
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.360]   making a God of wealth, money, anything, living on idols.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:19.720]   He forsakes ungodliness, and he also forsakes worldly lusts.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:27.880]   You know what they are, don't you? This raging rampant sex mania that's a
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:34.520]   worldly lust. This living for eating and drinking
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:40.200]   of all that belongs merely to the animal nature, they are worldly lusts.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:45.080]   He forsakes them all because he knows that these are the things that have put
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:49.240]   him in his precarious position. These are the things that damn the whole
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:54.040]   world. He leaves them. He must if he believes these things.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:59.560]   He leaves all iniquity. And on the other hand, positively begins
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.800]   to live soberly, which doesn't just mean abstinence
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.640]   from drinking alcohol. It includes that, but it means much more.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:12.680]   It means that he takes a sober view of life and of living.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:16.680]   He doesn't say, "Let's just have a good time. What's it matter? What's the use of
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.360]   anything until the third world war comes? Let's
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.400]   have our fill. Let's stay up dancing all night
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.080]   till three or four o'clock in the morning and do all these things of which
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.720]   they boast so much as if they were wonderful."
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.160]   "No, no," he says. "Life isn't something like that. It's big.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.440]   It's gigantic. It's momentous. I must be sober.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:40.200]   I must be serious. I must realize the consequences
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:45.480]   that hang upon my way of living soberly."
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:52.040]   Do you think and do you live in a sober manner or in a giddy and a frivolous and
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.160]   a flippant manner?
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:59.400]   Do you really think that the so-called high life of society is wonderful?
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.760]   If you do, you're not sober.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:11.640]   Righteously. And gone. You begin to listen to your
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:16.760]   conscience in a new way. You begin to be interested in morality.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.960]   You begin to read your Ten Commandments. You read the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.240]   You say, "I want to live like that. I must live like that." Why?
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.640]   Well, let me give you the answer just as I close. I say this is inevitable.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.960]   A man who really believes the statements of the gospel must deduce this.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.640]   Why? Well, for these reasons.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:41.720]   He sees at once that all these other things are wrong
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:48.040]   in and of themselves. He begins to hate them.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.040]   Once upon a time he used to like drink and he used to like getting drunk and he
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.160]   burst of it. And he used to enjoy jokes about it. It
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:59.240]   was wonderful. Now he sees it with a different eye. He
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.760]   says there's a man endowed with God, with faculties and
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.040]   propensities, making a beast of himself. It's tragedy.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.880]   It's a tragedy. He hates it.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:16.840]   And so with all these other things which the world would have us believe are
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.640]   so wonderful, the man begins to hate them.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.840]   He says they're wrong. They're unclean. They're unjust.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:28.920]   They're unrighteous. They're producing problems. They're breaking up families.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.040]   They're causing little children to suffer. They're causing
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:36.040]   penury. They're causing lack of food. They're causing lack of clothing.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.440]   They're the greatest causes of evil and misery and unhappiness in the world.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:45.800]   They're wrong in and of themselves. I'll never touch them again.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:52.600]   But he doesn't stop at that you see. He's got another reason for leaving those
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.800]   and taking up the others.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:01.080]   He says if I continue with these it leads me to perdition.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.440]   It'll bring me directly under the wrath of God.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.480]   And I shall be punished and I shall go to hell.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:11.160]   And I'll wake up in hell when it's too late like the rich men
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.760]   spoken of by our Lord, by that man, Dives.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.040]   I'll realize it when it's too late and I'll be in the flame
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:22.920]   and the torment and can do nothing about it. I'll do it now.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:27.480]   I don't want to spend my eternity as I am now.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.320]   I don't want to spend an eternity that's going to be infinitely worse than this.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.600]   My position is dangerous. I must leave it at once
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.920]   in order that I may avoid that. But you know he's got a nobler and a grander
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.080]   reason than those and it's this.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:49.400]   He will say to himself
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:54.440]   how can I possibly go on living like that
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:51:01.320]   when I know that it is offensive to this God of grace.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:07.080]   How can I go on living like that when I know what it has cost
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:17.560]   the God of heaven who spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:21.080]   How can I go on living in that unrighteous,
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:28.280]   ungodly, evil, iniquitous manner when I know and see now that it was
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.600]   because of those things that the son of God had to come from
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.080]   heaven to earth, had to abase himself and humble himself,
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.440]   had to endure the contradiction of sinners against himself
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.280]   for 33 years. It was because of things like that
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.840]   that he had to endure the crown of thorns and his back to be scourged
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:54.040]   and the people to spit in his face and to have the nails beaten into his
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:58.040]   hands and into his feet and to be forsaken of his father
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:02.360]   and to cry out, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.960]   Those are the things that led to that. How can I?
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.920]   It's impossible.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:15.320]   He loved me so much that though I was a sinner and ungodly
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:19.240]   and his enemy and vile, he did all that for me
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:23.320]   to save me from perdition and hell.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:31.400]   I cannot continue to do things that hurt him, things that he hates
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.560]   and abominates. I cannot do things that insult his
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.760]   father. It's impossible. I must leave them,
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:47.320]   denying ungodliness and worldly lusts. I'm going to live soberly
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:53.880]   and righteously and godly in this present world. I want to please him.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.480]   I want to show my gratitude to him. I want to give my life
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:02.440]   to him who gave his life for me. Henceforth, let nothing please
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:09.080]   nor pain me apart, O Lord, from thee.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:15.720]   It's inevitable logic, isn't it? That's why, you see, I never plead with people
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:19.640]   to take decisions and to come forward and say this or that. No, no.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.240]   If they've seen the truth, they'll be bound to do it.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.680]   The gospel teaches us. It's not a sudden feeling.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.240]   It's not a sudden decision. It's a man solemnly looking at the truth,
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.840]   realizing its propositions, seeing what it's saying
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:40.200]   and what it means, and deducing the inevitable conclusion.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:45.720]   And immediately putting them into practice.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:53.640]   I ask you, therefore, on this last Sunday night of this whole year,
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:54:02.600]   as the gospel taught you these things, as it taught you about the Son of God,
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:08.040]   as it taught you about his first coming, his second coming,
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.400]   as it taught you the truth about yourself,
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:19.800]   as it taught you that the day of grace is still young,
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:28.040]   that the gate of mercy is still open, and that if you've never
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:31.640]   entered it before, you can do so at this very minute,
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:38.520]   just as you are. Because if you realize these truths,
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:43.000]   and confess and acknowledge your sin to God, and repent before him,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.040]   and cry for mercy, he will give you an assurance of an immediate pardon.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.520]   He will clothe you with the righteousness of his own Son.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:58.840]   He will accept you and receive you, and he will begin to shower
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:03.800]   his blessings upon you. Thank God,
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:09.560]   the interval between the two comings
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:16.920]   has not yet ended. But as this whole year, 1958,
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:26.600]   is ending, so the day of grace will end. Therefore, I plead with you,
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:37.080]   be ye reconciled to God. Today is the day of grace. Today
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:45.080]   is the day of salvation. Forsake the world, this passing, present world, and all its
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:52.680]   evil ways. Give yourself to him. Deny yourself.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:56:00.840]   Take up the cross and begin to follow him. Following him
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:04.520]   is the greatest joy you'll ever know in the world,
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:13.480]   and it will lead you to that surpassing glory that is yet to come.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:21.640]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
