[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.480]   [ Silence ]
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.480]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.340]   >> All right.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.940]   So you probably don't realize
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.200]   that right now you're actually looking
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.120]   at something quite rare
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.740]   because I am a millennial computer scientist book author
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.780]   standing on a TED stage
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.880]   and yet I've never had a social media account.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.200]   How this happened was actually somewhat random.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.000]   You know, social media first came onto my radar when I was
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.620]   at college, my sophomore year of college.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040]   This is when Facebook arrived at our campus.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.500]   And at the time, which was right after the first dot com bust,
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.820]   I had had a dorm room business.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.020]   I had had to shut it down in the bust.
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.280]   And then suddenly this other kid from Harvard named Mark had this
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.300]   product called Facebook and people were getting excited
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.700]   about it.
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.920]   So it was sort of a fit
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.340]   of somewhat immature professional jealousy.
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.420]   I said I'm not going to use this thing.
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.220]   I'm not going to help this kid's business.
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.220]   What's it ever going to amount to?
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.580]   So as I go along my life, I look up not long later and I see
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.220]   that everyone I know is really hooked on this thing.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.100]   And from the clarity you can get when you have some objectivity,
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.020]   some perspective on it, I realized this seems a little
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.140]   bit dangerous so I never signed up.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.020]   I've never had a social media account since.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.660]   So I'm here for two reasons.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.480]   I want to deliver two messages.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.560]   The first message I want to deliver is
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.600]   that even though I've never had a social media account, I'm okay.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.860]   You don't have to worry.
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.020]   It turns out I still have friends.
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.360]   I still know what's going on in the world.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.720]   As a computer scientist, I still collaborate with people all
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.460]   around the world.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.540]   I'm still regularly exposed serendipitously
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.020]   to interesting ideas and I rarely describe myself
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.100]   as lacking in entertainment options.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.400]   So I've been okay but I'd go even farther.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.420]   I'd go even farther and say not only am I okay
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.760]   without social media but I think I'm actually better off.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.660]   I think I'm happier.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.240]   I think I find more sustainability in my life
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.100]   and I think I've been more successful professionally
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.320]   because I don't use social media.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.940]   So my second goal here on stage is to try to convince more
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.300]   of you to believe the same thing.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.360]   To see if I could actually convince more of you
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.720]   that you too would be better off if you quit social media.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.360]   So if the theme of this TEDx event is future tense,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.020]   I guess in other words this would be my vision
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.980]   of the future would be one
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.500]   in which fewer people actually use social media.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.960]   Okay, so that's a big claim.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.060]   I think I need to back it up some.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.820]   I thought what I would do is take the three most common
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.840]   objections I hear when I suggest to people
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.140]   that they quit social media and then for each
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.480]   of these objections I'll try to defuse the hype and see
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.900]   if I can actually push in some more reality.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.000]   So this is the first most common objection I hear.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.600]   That's not a hermit, that's actually a hipster web
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.860]   developer down from 8th Street.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.320]   I'm not sure.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.800]   Hipster or hermit, sometimes it's hard to tell.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.560]   So this first objection goes as follows.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.060]   Cal, social media is one of the fundamental technologies
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.300]   of the 21st century.
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.080]   To reject social media would be an act of extreme bloodism.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.500]   It would be like riding to work in a horse
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.620]   or using a rotary phone.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.360]   I can't take such a big stance in my life.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.420]   So my reaction to that objection is I think that is nonsense.
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.620]   Social media is not a fundamental technology.
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.260]   It leverages some fundamental technologies
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.240]   but it's better understood as this, which is to say it's a source
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.940]   of entertainment, it's an entertainment product.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.080]   The way the technologist Jaron Lanier puts it is
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.880]   that these companies offer you shiny treats in exchange
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.240]   for minutes of your attention and bites
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.640]   of your personal data, which can then be packaged up and sold.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.380]   So to say that you don't use social media should not be a
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.880]   large social stance, it's just rejecting one form
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.860]   of entertainment for others.
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.240]   It should be no more controversial
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.480]   than saying I don't like newspapers,
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.900]   I like to get my news from magazines.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.480]   Or I prefer to watch cable series
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.120]   as opposed to network television series.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.880]   It's not a major political or social stance
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.980]   to say you don't use this product.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.000]   My use of the slot machine image up here also is not accidental
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.360]   because if you look a little bit closer at these technologies,
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.220]   it's not just that they're a source of entertainment
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.020]   but they're actually a somewhat unsavory source
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.580]   of entertainment.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.840]   We now know that many of the major social media companies
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.260]   hire individuals called attention engineers
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.320]   who borrow principles from Las Vegas Casino Gambling among
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.200]   other places to try to make these products
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.500]   as addictive as possible.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.940]   That is the desired use case of these products is
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.360]   that you use it in an addictive fashion
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.540]   because that maximizes the profit that can be extracted
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.840]   from your attention and data.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.360]   So it's not a fundamental technology, it's just a source
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.780]   of entertainment, one among many and it's somewhat unsavory
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.720]   if you look a little bit closer.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.040]   So here's the second common objection I hear when I suggest
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.280]   that people quit social media.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.300]   The objection goes as follows.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.200]   Cal, I can't quit social media because it is vital to my success
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.820]   in the 21st century economy.
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.720]   If I do not have a well-cultivated social media
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.860]   brand people won't know who I am, people won't be able
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.340]   to find me, opportunities won't come my way
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.520]   and I will effectively disappear from the economy.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.940]   So again my reaction is once again,
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.720]   this objection also is nonsense.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.980]   So I recently published this book that draws
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.480]   on multiple different strands of evidence to make the point
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.100]   that in a competitive 21st century economy what the market
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.080]   values is the ability to produce things
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.180]   that are rare and are valuable.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.560]   You can produce something that's rare and is valuable,
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.860]   the market will value that.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.740]   What the market dismisses for the most part are activities
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.720]   that are easy to replicate and produce a small amount of value.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.920]   Well social media use is the epitome of an easy
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.220]   to replicate activity that does not directly produce a lot
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.820]   of value, it's something that any 16-year-old
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.880]   with a smartphone can do.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.600]   By definition the market is not going
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.280]   to give a lot of value to those behaviors.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.060]   It's instead going to reward the deep concentrated work required
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.420]   to build real skills and to apply those skills
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.080]   to produce things like a craftsman
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.980]   that are rare and that are valuable.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.860]   To put it another way, if you can write an elegant algorithm,
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.120]   if you can write a legal brief that can change a case,
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.360]   if you can write a thousand words of prose that's going
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.640]   to fixate a reader right to the end.
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.540]   If you can look at a sea of ambiguous data and apply
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.340]   statistics and pull out insights
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.840]   that could transform a whole business strategy,
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.460]   if you can do these type of activities
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.260]   which require deep work that produce outcomes
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.440]   that are rare and valuable, people will find you.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.140]   You will be able to write your own ticket, you will be able
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.820]   to build the foundation of a very meaningful
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.220]   and successful professional life regardless
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.160]   of how many Instagram followers you have.
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.700]   So this is the third common objection I hear
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.060]   when I suggest to people that they quit social media.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.040]   In some sense I think it might be one of the most important.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.880]   So this objection goes as follows.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.520]   Cal, maybe I agree with you, maybe you're right,
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.800]   it's not a fundamental technology,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.980]   maybe using social media is not at the core
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.780]   of my professional success, but you know what?
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.340]   It's harmless.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.220]   I have some fun on it.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.440]   Weird Twitter is funny.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.300]   I don't even really use it that much.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.300]   I'm a first adopter.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.180]   It's just kind of interesting to try it out and maybe I might miss
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.140]   out on something if I don't use it.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.940]   What's the harm?
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.860]   So again I look back and I say this objection also is nonsense.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.980]   In this case what it misses is what I think is a very important
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.980]   reality that we need to talk about more frankly,
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.420]   which is that social media brings
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.420]   with it multiple well-documented significant harms.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.200]   And we actually have to confront these harms head on when trying
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.500]   to make decisions about whether or not we embrace this
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.720]   technology and let it into our lives.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.400]   So one of these harms that we know this technology brings has
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.100]   to do with your professional success.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:13.460]   So I just argued before that the ability to focus intensely
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.860]   to produce things that are rare and valuable, to hone skills
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.580]   that the marketplace values, that this is what's going
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.580]   to matter in our economy.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.480]   But right before that I argued
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.660]   that social media tools are designed to be addictive.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.040]   The actual design desired use case of these tools is
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.640]   that you fragment your attention as much
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.100]   as possible throughout your waking hours.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.440]   That's how these tools are designed to use.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.000]   Well we have a growing amount of research which tells us
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.300]   that if you spend large portions of your day in a state
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.500]   of fragmented attention, so large portions of your day
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.920]   where you're constantly breaking up your attention,
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.280]   take a quick glance, do a just check, let me just quickly look
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.880]   at Instagram, that this can permanently reduce your capacity
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.680]   for concentration.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.380]   In other words you could permanently reduce your capacity
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.080]   to do exactly the type of deep effort that we're finding
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.100]   to be more and more necessary
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.460]   in an increasingly competitive economy.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.940]   So social media use is not harmless.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.080]   It can actually have a significant negative impact
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.460]   on your ability to thrive in the economy.
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.020]   I am especially worried about this when we look
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.540]   at the younger generation coming up
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.200]   which is the most saturated in this technology.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.140]   If you lose your ability to sustain concentration you're
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.060]   going to become less and less relevant to this economy.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.120]   There's also psychological harms that are well documented
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.060]   in social media brings that we do need to address.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.540]   So we know from the research literature
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.340]   that the more you use social media the more likely you are
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.060]   to feel lonely or isolated.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.820]   We know that the constant exposure
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.480]   to your friends carefully curated positive portrayals
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.400]   of their life can leave you to feel inadequate
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.980]   and can increase rates of depression.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.040]   And something I think we're going to be hearing more
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.020]   about in the near future is
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.640]   that there's a fundamental mismatch
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.040]   between the way our brains are wired and this behavior
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.700]   of exposing yourself to stimuli
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.180]   with intermittent rewards throughout all
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.180]   of your waking hours.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.500]   So it's one thing to spend a couple hours
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.780]   at the slot machine in Las Vegas,
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.840]   but if you bring a slot machine with you and you pull
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.520]   that handle all day long from when you wake
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.980]   up to when you go to bed, we're not wired from it.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.220]   It short circuits the brain and we're starting to find
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.480]   that it has actual cognitive consequences,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   one of them being the sort
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.460]   of pervasive background hum of anxiety.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.600]   Now the canary in the coal mine
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.120]   for this issue is actually college campuses.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.180]   If you talk to mental health experts
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.860]   on college campuses, they'll tell you along with the rise
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.240]   of ubiquitous smartphone use
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.540]   and social media use among the students on the campus came an
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.700]   explosion of anxiety related disorders on those campuses.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.480]   So that's the canary in the coal mine.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.640]   This type of behavior is a mismatch for our brain wire
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.560]   and it can make you feel miserable.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.500]   So there's real cost to social media use,
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.300]   which means when you're trying to decide should I use this
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.180]   or not, saying it's harmless is not enough.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.740]   You actually have to identify a significantly positive clear
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.300]   benefit that can outweigh these potential completely
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.140]   non-trivial harms.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:05.440]   So people often ask, okay, but what is life
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.880]   like without social media?
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.420]   That can actually be a little bit scary to think about.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.100]   What I found from people I know who have gone
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.780]   through this process, there can be a few weeks
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.400]   that are difficult.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.500]   It actually is like a true detox process.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.360]   The first two weeks can be uncomfortable.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.680]   You feel a little bit anxious.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.120]   You feel like you're missing a limb.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.140]   But after that, things settle down and actually life
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.380]   after social media can be quite positive.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.880]   There's two things I can report back to you from the world
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.060]   of no social media use.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.500]   First, it can be quite productive.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.500]   Be quite productive.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.720]   So I'm a professor at a research institution.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.460]   I've written five books.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.020]   I rarely work past 5 p.m. on the weekday.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.780]   Part of the way I'm able to pull that off is because it turns
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.700]   out if you treat your attention with respect,
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.760]   you don't fragment it.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.120]   You allow it to stay whole.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.740]   You preserve your ability to concentrate.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.600]   When it comes time to work, you can actually do one thing
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.660]   after another and do it with intensity.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.760]   And intensity can be traded for time.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.020]   It's surprising how much you can get done in an eight-hour day
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.220]   if you're able to give each thing intense concentration
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:05.840]   after another.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.040]   Something else I can report back from life
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   without social media is that outside
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.940]   of work things can be quite peaceful.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:19.120]   So I often joke I'd be very comfortable being a 1930s farmer
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.440]   because if you look at my leisure time,
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.800]   I read newspaper while the sun comes up.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.400]   I listen to baseball on the radio.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.620]   I honest to God sit in a leather chair and read hardcover books
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.900]   at night after my kids go to bed.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.580]   It sounds old-fashioned, but I'll tell you,
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.920]   they were on to something back then.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.400]   It's actually a restorative, very peaceful way
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.780]   to actually spend your time out of work.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.640]   You don't have the constant hum of stimuli
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.040]   and the background hum of anxiety
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.960]   that comes along with that.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.140]   So life without social media is really not so bad.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.320]   So I pulled together these threads
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.560]   and you see my full argument for why I think not everyone,
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.000]   but certainly much more people than right now use social media.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.960]   Much more people should not be using social media.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.240]   And that's because we can first, to summarize,
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.140]   discard with the main concerns
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.300]   that somehow it's a fundamental technology you have to use.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:03.860]   Nonsense.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.340]   It's a slot machine in your phone.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.440]   We can discard with this notion that you're not going
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.860]   to get a job if you don't use social media.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.800]   Nonsense.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.040]   Anything a 16-year-old with a smartphone can do is not going
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.160]   to be what the market rewards.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.080]   And then I emphasized the point that there's real harms with it.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.040]   So it's not just harmless.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.220]   You really would have to have a significant benefit before you
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.560]   would actually say this tradeoff is worth it.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.680]   And finally I noted that life
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.340]   without social media there's real positives associated
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:27.600]   with it.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.360]   So I'm hoping that when many of you actually go
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.440]   through this same calculus,
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.160]   you'll at least consider the perspective I'm making right
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.840]   now, which is many more people would be much better off
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.580]   if they didn't use this technology.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.140]   Now of course some of you might disagree.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.900]   Some of you might have scathing but accurate critiques of me
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.440]   and my points.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.780]   And of course I welcome all negative feedback.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.680]   I just ask that you direct your comments towards Twitter.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.840]   Thank you.
