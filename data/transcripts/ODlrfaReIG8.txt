[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   I would like to call your attention once more to this great statement made by the Apostle
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.320]   Paul in his epistle to the Romans in chapter 11 from verse 25 to verse 32. I'm not going
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.200]   to read it all again, but let me read parts of it. "For I would not, brethren, that ye
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.160]   should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits, that
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.840]   blindness in part is heaven to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in, and
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.600]   so all Israel shall be saved." Then resuming at verse 28, "As concerning the gospel, they
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.640]   are enemies for your sakes, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the Father's
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.720]   sakes. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance, for as ye in times past
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.400]   have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief, even so have
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:13.160]   these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. For
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.920]   God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all." Now that's
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.200]   the statement, that is, this great prophecy which is made here by the Apostle with regard
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.240]   to his fellow countrymen, the Jews. And as you know, the way we have interpreted that
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.560]   as we have interpreted the whole chapter is this, that the Apostle is here prophesying
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.840]   a revelation of a mystery, as he puts it, has been granted unto him, and he is passing
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.480]   on this knowledge and information to these members of the Church of God at Rome. And
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.840]   the prophecy is this, that the bulk of the nation of the Jews are going to be converted,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.440]   are going to become believers of the gospel, and are going to be added to the Christian
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.320]   Church. Now that's the general thesis. Now last Friday night we said that there were
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.560]   certain general lessons that can be taught from this statement in addition to that particular
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.880]   statement. That's the big thing, that's the all-important thing. But because it is
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.400]   such a great statement, there are certain general lessons and principles which we can
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.040]   learn from it. Now I suggested something like this. I said that here we are really taught
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.160]   how to interpret prophecy. And we indicated that the danger is the danger of reading in
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.440]   things that are not here, in order to make our prophetic scheme perfect and entire. Very
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.840]   well. So we then indicated the things that are not even mentioned here. One is the millennium.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.480]   The other is the land of Israel or of Palestine. Not mentioned at all. Nothing about a unique
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.440]   and separate position for the Jews in God's ultimate economy. Nothing of the sort. They
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.400]   go in like everybody else, Jews and Gentiles are saved in exactly the same way. And we
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.000]   ended by showing how we are not given any indication here as to when all this is going
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.520]   to happen. We considered the idea, the suggestion, that this may happen when the second advent
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.160]   takes place. And we gave you various reasons why we felt that we could not regard it in
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.240]   that way and manner. And particularly that great statement in Luke 18, "When the Son
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.160]   of Man is come, shall he find the faith on the earth." Very well. The important point
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.160]   I was establishing was that those subjects are really not dealt with here. And we must
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.040]   learn to be content with what the scriptures tell us, not what we'd like them to say.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.400]   We must be content with what has been revealed and not desire to know anything beyond that.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.160]   Now there's just one other further matter in that connection that I must deal with before
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.240]   we leave this aspect of the subject. We are not told either as to how all this is going
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:18.200]   to happen. It's interesting to speculate as to how it will take place. We know that
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.440]   now for a number of years there have been various missions to the Jews, which are doing
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.080]   excellent work, may God continue to bless them. It may be that through such activities
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.240]   that this great event is going to take place in connection with the nation or the bulk
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   of the nation of the children of Israel. We don't know. We are simply not told. All
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.040]   the apostle is concerned to say here is that it's going to happen. When and how, whether
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:56.560]   it will be sudden, whether it will be gradual, we just don't know. And therefore any ideas
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.240]   that we may put forward with regard to that are nothing but sheer speculation. It's
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.840]   tempting to speculate but we must resist the temptation. We don't know. All we do know
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:18.040]   is this, that when it does happen it will be solely the result of God's great mercy.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.400]   Nothing else will account for it because as he tells us in the 32nd verse, "God hath
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:31.000]   concluded them all in unbelief, that in order that through, in order that he might have
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.080]   mercy upon all." So however it happens, whenever it happens, it will be entirely the
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.320]   result of God's mercy. The thing therefore that we've got to hold
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.760]   on to is this, that this is going to happen and it's going to be an amazing thing. So
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.960]   amazing that no terms are adequate to describe it save the terms that he uses in the 15th
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:03.880]   verse. It will indeed be life from the dead. It will be a most revivifying thing in the
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.640]   life and the history of the Church. It will be such a phenomenon that it will fill God's
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:17.840]   people not only with astonishment and amazement but also with wonder, love and praise. Very
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:26.560]   well, now then, there are certain general lessons which we learn from this all-important
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.880]   passage. But I want to go still further. I think that at this point now it behoves us
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.680]   to make a kind of general review of the teaching in particular of this chapter, but in a sense
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:49.080]   also of chapters 9 and 10 as well. Because this is indeed a most important statement.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.920]   You can describe it if you like as the Apostle Paul's philosophy of history. Now there's
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.680]   a great deal of interest at the present time in the philosophy of history. A number of
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.480]   books are constantly being published dealing with this very subject. And it's not surprising
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.440]   because you and I are living in a century when there is no problem that is more acute
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:20.480]   for any thinking person than this whole problem of history. I mean by that, is there any explanation
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.120]   of history? Is there any way of understanding what's happening? Why are these things happening?
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:33.160]   World wars, crises, tension and so on and so forth. Now all this has caused people to
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.960]   examine this whole problem of history. The problem of time, if you like, comes into it
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:46.320]   as well. But it is obviously a very vital and urgent matter for people to be considering
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.160]   in a century such as this present one. And as I say, that is being done.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:08:00.320]   Now then, our position as Christians is this. That there is only one real philosophy of
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.840]   history and it is the one that you find in the Bible. All the others break down. It would
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:14.400]   be very simple indeed to show that. Indeed there is a tendency on the part of most historians
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.360]   at the present time, most of the great historians that ever exist, that they can find no meaning
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:27.960]   in history at all, no purpose. Some have put forward their theories. There was a famous
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:34.120]   German, Oswald Spengler, he was very popular about thirty years ago and he had this theory
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:41.240]   of cycles and he prophesied the sort of doom and the end of western civilization. And then
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.960]   you've had a great man like Professor Arnold Toynbee in his monumental study of history
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:51.800]   and so on, with his action and reaction. Now all these are just attempts to explain what's
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:58.080]   happening. They're not adequate even as that. They disagree amongst one another and as I
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.080]   say the prevailing tendency seems to be to say that there is no meaning at all. It's
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:11.320]   all accident. There is no great purpose. Those of you who've ever read the history of Europe
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.280]   by the late Mr. H. A. L. Fisher of Oxford, who was once a cabinet member in the First
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.600]   World War, you will remember that he says in the introduction there that having spent
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.440]   his lifetime in studying history he's come to the conclusion that there is no purpose,
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:32.360]   that he can discern at all in it. Things just happen. But there is no plan, there is no
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:40.160]   scheme, there is no end, there is no direction. That then is the kind of prevailing philosophy
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:46.920]   of history. And you see it's finally hopeless and doesn't give us any help whatsoever.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:53.960]   On the other hand, the Bible deals with this in a very specific manner. And one of the
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.920]   most notable passages in the whole of the Bible in which this kind of philosophy of
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:05.680]   history, or if you like, an outline of history, is dealt with is the very passage that we've
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:12.160]   been considering together in such detail. The Apostle Paul, here in this whole section,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:19.400]   gives us what I'm describing as his philosophy of history. What does he teach? Well, here,
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:27.560]   it seems to me, are the principles which he teaches. And I know of nothing that is more
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:33.840]   comforting and consoling at the present time than just this teaching. The first great principle
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.920]   which he lays down, or if you like to look at it in another way, the overarching principle
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:48.560]   which covers everything, is this, that everything is under the hand of God. Everything.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:56.760]   Now as we've been working out these details, you must have been impressed by their effect.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:06.640]   You'll notice indeed that this is the characteristic of all the great biblical reviews of history.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.320]   Maybe you noticed when you're reading the book of Psalms, when the psalmist is dealing
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:18.840]   with a very depressed state and condition in the life of the children of Israel, what
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:25.120]   he so often does is to review the whole of their history. There are many synopses of
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.240]   the history of the children of Israel scattered about the Psalms. And when you come to the
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.200]   New Testament, you get the same thing. In chapter 7 of the book of Acts of the Apostles,
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:41.840]   you get Stephen doing this, Stephen reviewing the whole story. And as I showed you by the
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:48.200]   reading at the beginning of Acts 13, the Apostle Paul did exactly the same in Antioch of Pisidian.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:55.960]   In other words, their point is that there is a scheme visible, and it's all under God.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:04.680]   God is over all. Everything is under the almighty hand of God. That's the thing that they keep
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.960]   on saying. Of course, it is the great message of the Bible. That's why it starts as it does.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:15.720]   In the beginning, God. It starts with God, it ends with God. All is under the hand of
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:24.880]   God. That's its unique message. He reigns and he rules over all. Now, you can't read
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:30.440]   this passage that we've been dealing with without seeing it. You see, the prophecy implies
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:36.840]   that immediately. Nothing seems so impossible or so unlikely to happen when the Apostle
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.880]   was writing as that the Jews as a nation should ever believe the gospel and become members
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.720]   of the Christian Church. But Paul says it's going to happen. And why is it going to happen?
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.920]   The answer is, God is able to graft them in again. And it's the only explanation.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:00.040]   Now, here then, you see, is the great first principle. That everything is under the hand
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:07.240]   of God. But, you've got to say things immediately after that. Because, if you just leave it
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.520]   at that, people will be in difficulties. They will say, if that is so, well then why does
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.280]   this happen? Why did that happen? Very well, the answer is this. God, while being over
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:25.240]   all, permits many things to happen. Many things that seem to be the exact opposite of his
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:32.960]   own plan and purpose. And we've seen instances of that, you see, the fact that the children
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:42.560]   of Israel reject the gospel. God has permitted that, otherwise it wouldn't have happened.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.480]   But it's still, and this is the point, this is the whole argument here, that though God
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:53.520]   permits many things to happen, that doesn't mean that they're out of hand. It doesn't
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.600]   mean that he has ceased to control them. The great principle always is that even these
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:09.920]   things are still under the governance of God. Now, in many ways, the classic statement with
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:17.320]   regard to this is the book of Job, where it's made quite plain in the first chapter that
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:23.960]   the devil, even the devil, is under God. The devil has got great power, but he's not
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:29.680]   a free agent. The devil couldn't deal with Job without getting permission to do so from
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.640]   God. God has permitted evil. Now this is a great mystery, and nobody can explain it.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.440]   We are too small, I hope, to deal with this later, but we are too small to understand.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:46.480]   All we know is that God in his infinite wisdom has permitted evil and sin. We may speculate
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.320]   as to why he did so. We may argue that because he created men perfectly, he had to create
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:57.280]   him free, and that freedom includes the possibility of saying no as well as yes. All right, that's
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.520]   philosophic speculation. It may be right, it may not be right. All we know is that God
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:09.480]   has permitted evil. But, and here's the essence of the biblical message, though he
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:17.800]   has permitted evil, and though evil is very powerful and works much havoc, it is still
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:27.520]   under the almighty hand of God. Everything is under the hand of God, even evil. Now,
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.600]   I had to warn you a few Friday nights back not to misunderstand that, not to say that
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:39.920]   God created evil. That's wrong. What I am saying is that God permits it and then overrules
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:47.960]   it, can take it and bend it to his own will, and use it for his own great and wonderful
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.920]   purposes. Now, that's what we've been seeing as we've been studying this chapter. Paul,
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.720]   you remember, says quite plainly and clearly in the 11th verse, "I say then, have they
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.520]   stumbled that they should fall? God forbid, but rather through their fall salvation is
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.240]   come unto the Gentiles." That's it. I'll elaborate that in a moment. But now there
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.640]   is our first principle, then, and it stands out in this chapter, as it does in this section,
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:20.240]   as it does in the essential biblical message. Everything is under the hand of God. He lives,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:28.000]   he reigns, he's over all. The Lord reigneth. Let the people tremble. There's the first
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:37.200]   great principle. Then, secondly, and this of course, in a sense, comes out of the first,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:45.280]   God does a great plan and purpose, which will certainly be carried out. Now, here is the
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:52.920]   great comfort. You can't read this chapter without seeing that at a glance. You look
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.080]   at things as they are and you say, "What's happening?" You may look back in history
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.200]   and you say, "I still don't understand it. I don't see any purpose." As I've
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.440]   quoted to you, that's what the secular historians have to say. But if you know your Bible, and
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:10.400]   if you've got this central biblical message, you'll say, "Oh yes, God has got a plan,
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:17.920]   he's got a purpose, and its execution is absolutely certain." That's what the
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.720]   apostle has been trying to argue. He says, "Look here, you are only looking at things
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.880]   as they are. Listen to me." And then he brings in his great prophecy. This is what's
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.680]   going to happen, in spite of all that is true now. Why is it going to happen? Well, because
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.440]   it's God's plan. He says, "You remember, you're as concerning the gospel, they are
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:42.040]   enemies for your sakes. But, as touching the election, they are beloved for the Father's
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:48.360]   sakes." That's it. What's this election? Well, that's God's plan and purpose. That's
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:55.560]   what God determined way back in eternity, began to put into practice in Abram and Isaac
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:02.680]   and Jacob. They are the Fathers. This great plan and purpose and scheme of God.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:09.280]   Well, if you haven't got hold of this, you've missed the central biblical message. The danger
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.480]   is, you see, as we read our Bible, we miss the wood because of the trees. We get immersed
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.080]   in problems and in details here and there. Well, my method is, as you know, to go into
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.960]   great detail in all these matters, and never to ignore a detail. But, having done that,
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.720]   it is our business to do what we are doing now. We stand back and we see the whole again,
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.960]   and that makes you see with increasing wonder and amazement how every single part is a part
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.120]   of a great whole. So, you're seeing the parts and the whole. And you really don't
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.040]   begin to understand the parts, except you see them in the light of the whole. So, you
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:52.280]   emphasize this great plan, this great purpose of God, which he has had in his mind before
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:58.360]   the very foundation of the world, and which he is certainly, by his almighty power, going
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:09.400]   to carry out in every single detail. Now, the Bible again tells us about that, that
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:16.560]   while we can be absolutely certain about that great fact of the plan and the purpose, we
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:24.440]   are left in considerable ignorance as to the time when he does various things. And this
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:30.600]   is where we get into such a power, and get so excited and so unhappy, because things
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:37.080]   don't happen according to our little timetables. The history of biblical exposition and God's
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.400]   people is strewn with people who've been fixing times and seasons, and have always
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:47.200]   been wrong, and they always will be. We're not meant to know that. We are told that.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:54.880]   The times and seasons don't pertain to us. But what we are told is this, that God has
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:02.760]   a plan and a purpose, including the time, and that everything happens according to his
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.400]   perfect timetable. Now, I could illustrate this to you at great
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:17.040]   length, but I mustn't do so. I leave you to find it out and to work it out for yourselves.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:23.840]   You find it, of course, shouting at you in many places in the Old Testament. The poor
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:30.000]   fellow, he couldn't understand it, so he cries out, "How long, O Lord?" He says,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.640]   "Why are you like a stranger? Are you asleep, as it were? What's the matter?" Well, you
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:43.000]   see, that's because of his impatience. But God has always got his time, and God suddenly
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.840]   acts when nobody expects it. Sometimes he allows a situation to develop to the very
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:53.360]   worst conceivable, and then he acts. But God had known it all along. All things are known.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:59.400]   He sees the end from the beginning. And when these men are in the right spiritual condition,
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.920]   they not only recognize that, they celebrate it, and they thank God for it.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:11.240]   So all we are left with is something like this. These are the great phrases. "When
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:18.280]   the fullness of the times was come." God sent forth his Son, made of a woman made under
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.520]   the law, to redeem them that were under the law. What's this fullness of time? Well,
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:31.000]   it really means God's hour, God's appointed time, the time that was originally in the
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.080]   mind of God. He gives indications of it. Never too clearly, you get it in prophecy. Take
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.560]   the prophecy of Daniel, for instance, where you get figures, you have days mentioned.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:49.480]   People tend to go off again after those. Now, there is a sense in which they are specific.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.600]   But they're never so specific that man can tell exactly when things are going to happen.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.880]   Looking back he can, but never otherwise. But known to God always. That's what makes
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:05.160]   prophecy possible. That's what makes the details that we are given in prophecy possible.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:12.960]   God has this perfect plan. And he knows the exact time of everything. But it is God alone
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:18.240]   who does know the time. Now, the crucial verse about all this is a statement of our Lord
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:26.800]   himself as recorded in the Gospel according to St. Mark, chapter 13, and verse 32. He's
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   talking about "heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away. But
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:40.040]   of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:49.920]   the Son, but the Father." This time, this day, and this hour is not only not known to
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:56.120]   men, it's not known to angels, it is not even known to the Son. This is a day and a
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:04.880]   time that is known alone to the Father. Very well then, we hold on to the big thing, which
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:11.680]   is that God has got this plan, has got this purpose. And he knows the end from the beginning,
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:19.960]   the time, the date, the everything is known to him. It is not to be known by us. We, as
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:26.200]   our Lord goes on to say, should be in this position, "take ye heed, watch and pray,
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:33.000]   for ye know not when the time is." That's how it's left to us. But, though we don't
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.760]   know the time, look at the consolation and the comfort of all of this, God knows. And
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:46.160]   because he is God, and because he is over all, nothing can ever upset it. Very well
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:56.360]   then, I come to my third deduction under this particular heading. And it is this, and it
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:06.080]   follows of course of necessity, that salvation is altogether and entirely of God. Here is,
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:15.400]   you see, biblical history. Here is Paul's philosophy of history. Men fallen in sin.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:22.080]   What about it? Well, God has got a plan of redemption. God is forming a new humanity.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:28.160]   God is saving people out of this present evil world for that world to come. That's the
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:34.000]   plan in its essence. God is not giving in to the devil. The devil is not to be allowed
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.840]   to be the final conqueror. Of course not. God is going to have a restored, renewed heaven
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:46.400]   and earth, and a new humanity that is perfect, the head of the new humanity being Christ.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:54.120]   All else shall be destroyed, eternally destroyed. Now then, so the great matter of interest
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.520]   to us is about this salvation. Who are these people who are going to belong to this new
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:06.020]   humanity and will dwell in this renewed, renovated, regenerated universe? And there's only one
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:11.680]   answer here, and the Apostle has kept on saying it in this chapter and in these three chapters.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.880]   And what he's always emphasized is that it is altogether and entirely of God. He stated
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:23.000]   it so clearly in chapter 9 and verse 11, "For the children not being not yet born, neither
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.360]   having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand not
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:38.480]   of works, but of him that calleth." All along he's been saying it. They are not all Israel
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.240]   that are of Israel, neither because they are of the seed of Abraham are they all children,
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:49.400]   but in Isaac shall thy seed be called. Why? Well God determined that, God chose that.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:56.400]   It's all of God, this promise, the children of promise. It's all the action of God. Isaac
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:01.080]   wouldn't have been born if it were merely a matter of natural birth and consequences.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:07.280]   Abraham was 99 and Sarah, her womb was dead because she was over 90. God worked a miracle.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.200]   That's typical, says Paul. This is his argument. And here in this chapter we've seen the same
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:20.580]   thing. Salvation is altogether and entirely of God. And that is what makes it certain.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:26.360]   That is what guarantees it. If it were dependent upon us, in any sense, it would fail for certain.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.920]   The fact that we are born again doesn't mean we don't sin, we sin ourselves out of it.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:39.720]   It is that it is of God that guarantees it all. And as he's been showing us here, salvation
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:47.760]   is solely the result of God's mercy. God hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:54.120]   have mercy upon us. This is the word, he keeps on repeating it. "For as you in times past
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:59.360]   have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief, even so these
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:05.320]   now also have not believed that through your mercy they may also obtain mercy." It's all
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:11.960]   of the mercy of God. And you know, my friends, were it not for the mercy of God, not a single
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   soul would ever have been saved, not one. We're all lost, we're all born in sin, we're
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.800]   all the children of Adam, and we've all died in Adam. And it's the mercy of God alone that
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:32.640]   makes salvation possible to anyone. But not only his mercy, his election. "Jacob have
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.320]   I loved, Esau have I hated." Before they were born, while they were still in their
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:44.760]   mother's womb together, the twins. Not as the result of their actions did God say that,
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:50.640]   it's prior to that, it's anterior to that. The great election of God, this great mysterious
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:56.200]   thing that foolish people try to understand. We're not to understand it, we're to recognize
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.640]   it, we're to look at ourselves and say, "Why am I a Christian? Is it because there's some
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.040]   innate goodness in me? Is it because I'm better than the other people who are not Christians?
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:10.320]   Is it because I'm a better fellow? What utter rubbish it is." And we know it is. "I am what
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:17.720]   I am by the grace of God." And if you're not amazed at yourself, well, I would say that
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.600]   you better examine the foundations again. It's all of the mercy of God, and it's all
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   the result of his election, and it's all brought about by his almighty power. That's what he's
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:36.760]   been proving in this chapter. Look, he says that you Gentiles, you in times past did not
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:43.400]   believe God. In the whole of the Old Testament period, the Gentiles rejected the teaching
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:49.360]   concerning God, which was possessed only by the Jews. There they were, entirely hopeless.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.840]   How did they ever come into the church? There's only one answer. It was the mercy of God,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:00.160]   it was the election of God, above all, it was the power of God. God took them the unnatural
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:08.720]   branches and he grafted them into this olive tree. It explains why Gentiles become Christians,
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.880]   but in exactly the same way, it explains why any Jew ever becomes a Christian, and why
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:20.920]   the nation as a whole will become Christian at some future time. What is happening, in
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:26.080]   other words, is that God is calling out a people for himself, out of the Jews, out of
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.840]   the Gentiles, and eventually this great influx, the fullness of the Gentiles, the fullness
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:38.520]   of the Jews. And there you will have this completed people of God. And this is the thing
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:48.560]   that he keeps on emphasizing. It is all entirely of God, and not at all of men. He proves that.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.840]   Look at you Gentiles, he says, you rejected it all. You were in unbelief. So do the Jews
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:30:01.240]   now. So that the fact that you ever become Christian is entirely and solely the result
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:07.800]   of God's grace and mercy and power. Now then, there is the general philosophy of history.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:15.720]   Here it is, you see. Men made perfect sins, the world becomes chaotic. Civilizations try
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.760]   to put things right. No good, we're only going round in circles, or there's no purpose
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.040]   at all. But then you come to the Bible, and you see this great purpose going right through,
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.360]   ending in the vision of the book of Revelation. The final deliverance, the return of Christ,
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.760]   the conquest and destruction of evil, and the setting up of this glorious kingdom which
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:42.840]   is eternal. That's the biblical view, or philosophy of history.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:53.120]   But now I want to be a little more practical. I want to be more of a pastor. I want to draw
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:31:01.600]   certain inferences or deductions, if you like, from this wonderful teaching. And oh, how
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   consoling it is, how wonderful it is. I'm sorry for people who don't understand the
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:12.060]   Bible. I really find it increasingly difficult to know how they manage to live at all. In
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:18.080]   days and times like this, particularly. But once you get hold of this great teaching,
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:24.080]   that it's all under God, and that his purposes are sure, you're able to draw deductions
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:34.680]   like this. Things are not always what they appear to be on the surface. I've been feeling
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.000]   that tremendously during the weeks that we've been working through this eleventh chapter
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:47.320]   of the epistle to the Romans. Things are not always what they appear to be on the surface.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:54.400]   This is the great teaching that comes out in the Bible so constantly. So many times
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:02.120]   it looked as if God had failed completely. His people are defeated, they're spat upon,
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:08.360]   they're despised and derided, and the enemy is loud and proud and arrogant, and the whole
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.520]   world is saying, "God, if there is a God, is defeated," and the children of Israel
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.800]   felt that he'd been defeated. That's what appearances seem to say, and it seemed an
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:24.640]   unanswerable argument. But you can't read a chapter like this and understand it or know
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:32.080]   your Bible without seeing what utter folly that is. Once you get this other viewpoint,
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:39.080]   things are not what they appear to be. It looks tonight as if the Jews as a nation will
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:44.120]   never become Christians, doesn't it? But they're going to be. Going to be. It looked
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:49.040]   absolutely hopeless at the time of the apostle Paul. They'd crucified their own Messiah.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.600]   They'd gone mad. They were vilifying the Christians and persecuting them. The things
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.360]   seemed impossible. Things are not as they appear to be. That's the whole statement
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:06.040]   here. Once you see it, from God's side. And you can put that, if you like, in a still
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:14.760]   more personal way. Take that hymn that we sang just now, William Cowper's hymn, "Behind
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:23.040]   a Frowning Providence." Oh, I'd like the next line to be this, "He hides a father's
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:29.880]   face." Smiling, if you like, but farther. "Behind a frowning providence, he hides
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:35.960]   a father's face." You think at times that God's against you. Because circumstances
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.320]   seem to be indicating that. Don't jump to conclusions. Once you get this message, you'll
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.440]   never feel that again. You'll say, "That's how things seem to be." It doesn't guarantee
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:54.240]   that they are. "Behind this frowning providence, he hides a father's face." But I'll put
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:04.840]   it like this in the second place. What appears to be thoroughly dead, may in a sense be produced
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:13.080]   by God for the furtherance of his own purposes. Certainly used by God for his own purposes.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:17.760]   Now, this is the great point which we've seen emerging so many times in this eleventh
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:27.440]   chapter, where he says quite specifically, in verse eleven, that "Rather through their
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:33.800]   fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles." He repeats that in verse twelve. Now if the
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.160]   fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:43.280]   Gentiles, how much more their fullness. Verse fifteen, "If the casting away of them be
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:48.640]   the reconciling of the world." That's how it turned to be. And this is a tremendous
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:35:00.080]   thing. And this is where we with our small minds so constantly tend to go astray. This
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:06.920]   principle of God overall even works like this. The things that seem to be the most antagonistic
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:14.080]   to God's purpose are actually serving his purpose. Now, the apostle has already told
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.920]   us that in chapter eight, as a matter of fact, in verse twenty-eight, "All things work
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.320]   together for good to them that love God." That's another way of putting it. Everything.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:29.640]   But we've seen, and I want to remind you of this, how in history this can be seen very
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:38.360]   plainly. The Roman Empire persecuted the Christians in a very grievous manner. The Roman Empire
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:44.600]   did its utmost to exterminate Christianity. And yet you know, it is equally true to say
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:55.720]   this, that the Roman Empire provided the most perfect machinery for the evangelization of
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:01.880]   the then known world that one can possibly imagine. I mean, they were such wonderful
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:07.440]   road builders. They'd conquered most of the world, and they'd built their roads.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:13.360]   They seem to have provided the very machinery that was necessary for the spread of the gospel.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:19.680]   It's an astounding thing. That's not an accident, my friends. God allowed this tremendous
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:25.000]   empire that did its best to exterminate Christianity to rise. Why? Well, he knew he was going to
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.960]   use it. And you might very well say the same thing about the Greek language. He'd allowed
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:37.160]   that great flowering period of Greek culture to take place in order that when his son came
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:43.200]   in the gospel, the language and the roads were ready. And on it went. What appeared
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.680]   to be against the interests of the Church, when seen from this angle, are in the very
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.840]   best interests of the Church. That's the philosophy.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:57.880]   And here's another one. You remember the destruction of the city of Jerusalem in A.D.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:04.400]   70, the greatest calamity that ever happened to the Jews, something that is very difficult
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:10.120]   to understand when you regard and look upon the Jews as they are as God's people, his
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:17.920]   own chosen people. And yet, as I've already shown you a few weeks back, there is no question
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:26.320]   at all about this. It was the destruction of Jerusalem and the scattering of the Jews
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:33.000]   that turned out to be the best thing possible and conceivable for the spreading of the gospel
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.240]   amongst the Gentiles. There were all sorts of difficulties, as we've seen, which continued
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:46.080]   and persisted while the Church was mainly Jewish. The Jewish prejudices were doing great
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:51.280]   harm. Once you get the destruction of Jerusalem, the whole position changes. It was one of
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:58.640]   the best things that ever happened from the standpoint of the evangelization of the Gentiles.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:08.560]   Historians have agreed further that the Arian persecutions had a very direct influence,
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:15.480]   again, upon the conversion of the Goths. Now the Arian heresy was a bad thing, but the
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:21.800]   persecutions in connected with it were used by God in the conversion of the Goths. In
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:26.120]   the same way, we are entitled to say that the declension of the Roman Catholic Church
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:32.000]   in the Middle Ages and right up to the period of the Reformation led to the Reformation,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.800]   which turned out to be, possibly, next to the Apostolic Era itself, the greatest period
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:46.680]   of evangelization, which has continued almost up until our very day. Now, this is just illustrative
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:53.320]   of the fact that what appears to be utterly inimical to the interests of the gospel turns
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:59.120]   out to be in the highest and the best interests of the gospel. The fall of the Jew has meant
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.560]   the salvation of the Gentile, the diminishing of the Jew, the riches of the Gentile. This
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:13.280]   is how God works, and it's marvelous. So I come to my third deduction under this heading.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:21.360]   I've hesitated a little bit about this one, but I'm sure I'm right. Extreme and violent
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   rejection of the gospel may, in a sense, be a good sign. What do I mean? I mean this.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:39.560]   God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. You remember
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:45.240]   we interpreted that as meaning that God included. This is God's action. He shuts them up.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:50.240]   There are certain instances of persons and of groups of people who have, first of all,
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:56.960]   to be shut up in violent unbelief before their conversion takes place. I always feel that
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.840]   the Apostle Paul himself is the most notable instance of this. You read the beginning of
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.120]   the ninth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and you see Saul of Tarsus
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:14.280]   setting out on a journey from Jerusalem to Damascus, wreathing out threatenings and slaughter.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:21.960]   Violent! That was the prelude to what happened a few hours later, when he suddenly saw the
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:29.840]   light from heaven in the face of Jesus Christ and was turned into the Apostle Paul. That's
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:35.520]   God's way of acting. So I end on this particular note, the comfort
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:43.320]   which we must draw from all this. And this is the comfort as I see it. Because of all
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:55.880]   this teaching, no case is hopeless. Now that to me is the most wonderful thing of all.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:04.880]   Simply because of this, no case is hopeless. Here's the argument, you see. No case appears
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:12.200]   to be as hopeless as that of the nation of the Jews. They were looking forward to their
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:19.040]   Messiah, he came. They were the very people who rejected him. They hated the Gospel, they
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:25.920]   rejected it, they persecuted his followers. Nothing seems so hopeless as the case of the
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.880]   Jews. And they've persisted more or less like that. But you see, you mustn't say
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:36.040]   they're hopeless. Why? Well, God is able to graft them in again, and he's going to
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:43.560]   do it. Because they're beloved for the Father's sake. No case is hopeless. The fact that a
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:48.920]   man like Saul of Tarsus was ever converted means that no one is ever hopeless. There
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.680]   isn't such a thing. You must say, but look at him, look at the attitude. The thing's
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.600]   impossible. It is impossible, you see, that that man can become a Christian. It is not.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:02.280]   Now of course, if you believe that a man decides himself whether he becomes a Christian, and
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.800]   it's his own great brain and understanding and goodness that makes him a Christian, you
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.760]   can't say this sort of thing. You've then got to say about certain people that they're
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:13.760]   absolutely hopeless. But if you agree with the Apostle Paul in the statement he made
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.400]   in the 16th verse of the first chapter of this great epistle, "I am not ashamed of
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:25.800]   the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth,
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:33.840]   to the Jew first, and also to the Greek." Having studied this chapter, you must come
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:43.480]   to the conclusion that no case is hopeless. I'm probably speaking now to people who've
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.320]   got some loved one and dear one who's not a Christian, and you've been praying for
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:54.620]   this loved one for many years. But he or she seems to be getting further away from it instead
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:59.440]   of nearer to it. And the devil is telling you, "Give up. Stop praying. There's no
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:06.200]   point. He or she is absolutely hopeless. My friend, give the answer of Romans 11. Nothing
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:14.560]   is impossible with God." He is able to graft them in again. He concludes all in unbelief
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:25.000]   in order that he might have mercy upon all. There is no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.360]   This to me is one of the most thrilling and amazing things about the Christian faith,
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:36.520]   and particularly about the work of a preacher or of a minister. People come and tell me
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.920]   about those they're interested in, and how utterly and completely and finally hopeless
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:47.900]   they seem to be. I always reply, and this is why there is no such thing as a hopeless
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:56.680]   case where God is concerned. All salvation is of God. It takes the power of God to save
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:05.400]   anybody, and therefore the power of God can save anybody. Thank God there is no such thing
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:14.720]   as a hopeless case. The power of God, this overarching principle, is a final answer to
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:21.500]   all such pessimism and hopelessness. And this is a comfort therefore, not only with respect
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:27.480]   to individuals, but it is equally a comfort with respect to the Church as a whole, the
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:36.160]   Church at large. We are living in probably one of the most evil periods in the long history
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:42.120]   of the Christian Church. Look at the world and its attitude to Christianity. Look at
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:48.600]   the power of unbelief. Look at the organization behind everything that is a person of God
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:55.000]   and his Christ. If you look at the present position merely with the eyes of men and human
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.640]   reason and understanding, you'll be bound to come to the conclusion that the Christian
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:07.760]   Church is finished. People are always pointing that out to me. And when I have a Sunday holiday,
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:13.280]   as I had recently, and I go to some simple service in other parts of the country, in
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:19.400]   the country and the small towns, I can see exactly what they mean. You know, you look
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.560]   at the little congregations and they're all middle-aged or old people, very few young
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.960]   people if any at all. And you say, "Well, another twenty years and the whole thing will
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:33.180]   be finished." And that's how many people reason and argue, and they get excited, and they
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.840]   propose to do this, that, and the other, and they've been doing that for years, but they
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.440]   don't make any difference at all. Things go on from bad to worse. My dear friends, there's
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:46.840]   only one answer to all that, and it's this, that God's purpose is sure, and nothing can
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:57.160]   stop it. But it is, you see, a part of his method, to allow things to go to the very
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:05.960]   limit, as it were, on the side of the enemy and the adversary. And then, when everybody
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:13.800]   says, "It's all up, it's finished," God arises, and his enemies are scattered, and the Church
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:20.840]   experiences a new period of revival. That is how revivals have always come, and the
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:26.200]   reason is quite obvious. If they came in any other way, some of us would be claiming that
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:32.000]   we'd produced it, that something we were doing had led to the revival. God always sees to
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.280]   it that nobody can ever claim it. He does it in his own way, and he allows things, he
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:46.920]   shuts us up in unbelief, until the whole thing seems hopeless. Then suddenly, he appears.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.440]   You remember the notable instance of that, in the twelfth chapter of the book of the
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:57.320]   Acts of the Apostles, that King Herod, who raised his hand against James, the apostle,
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.960]   and put him to death for no reason at all, and then arrested Peter, and threw him into
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:07.120]   prison, and put four quaternions of soldiers to look after him? And there he was, chained
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.480]   to a soldier on each side, and he was to be put to death the next morning. The Church
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:17.480]   had been praying from the moment of his imprisonment, but nothing happened. But they went on praying,
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:22.720]   and now it's only a matter of hours before Peter's going to be killed, as James was.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:29.480]   And everybody probably was beginning to feel hopeless. But suddenly, a light shined in
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:34.960]   the prison. An angel appeared and touched Peter on the side, and had to wake him up
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:40.080]   even, and his chains fell off him, and the door opened, and the keeper seemed to be asleep,
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:45.360]   and a mighty gate shutting up the whole prison from the city opened on its own hinges. And
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.320]   Peter couldn't believe it himself, he thought he was seeing a vision, but he was actually
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:55.200]   all there, and walking on his own feet, and found himself at the house of John Mark. And
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.840]   there that girl Rhoda couldn't believe it, and when she went in and told the very praying
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   church that Peter was knocking at the gate, they said, "You're mad!" But it had happened.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:13.520]   God had done it, and he let it continue until the very last moment, as it were. And that
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.760]   chapter ends in a most magnificent manner. This King Herod, who thought he was so powerful,
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.360]   certain people who lived nearby and were dependent upon him, came to him and did their obeisance,
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:29.280]   and he made a great oration to them, and they said, "This is the voice of a God and not
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:34.400]   of a man." Here he is, you see, almost turning himself into a God. God allows all that, he
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:39.220]   allows this man to inflate himself up almost to the heavens. But the next thing you read
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:47.640]   about him is this, that God sent an angel and smote him, and he was consumed of worms
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:57.160]   and gave up the ghost. What's the next word? This. But the word of God grew and multiplied.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:02.160]   These are but illustrations of the philosophy of history outlined in the eleventh chapter
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.360]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans. There's no such thing as hopelessness, this is how
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:12.240]   God has always acted. Men have frequently predicted, prophesied the end of the Church,
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:17.320]   preparing their funeral orations over the moribund body of the Church. God allows it
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:22.360]   all, and then when they think they've got everything, God arises. He blows and they
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:29.560]   vanish, they've gone. The Christian Church goes on to another period of mighty revival,
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:37.320]   reawakening, evangelism, success, and spread. Whatever the appearance is today, I say don't
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:43.280]   look at them, look at God. Look at this great scheme, this plan, this purpose, and realize
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:52.360]   that God is over all, he can never fail, his purposes are forever sure, and will certainly
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:50:05.960]   be brought to pass. Yes, the Jews, as a bulk, and as a people, in general as a nation, are
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:11.960]   going to be brought into the Christian Church. And it's such an incredible thing that when
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:20.320]   it happens, well, we'll all feel that it's exactly like life from the dead. May that
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:28.240]   day soon dawn.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:37.760]   O Lord our God, we come before thee to humble ourselves in thy holy presence. We bless thy
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:45.560]   name, O Lord, for the glory and the wonder and the marvel of thy ways. Forgive us, O
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:55.840]   Lord, for our unbelief. Forgive us for our fears and forbiddings of evil. Open our eyes
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:03.560]   that we may see the truth. Open our understandings to receive it. Open our hearts that they may
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:14.200]   rejoice in it. O God, receive our unworthy praise and our unworthy adoration. May thy
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:22.240]   name be glorified in our midst, and in the midst of all thy people at this present hour.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:30.440]   Grant us to see, and ever to realize that he that is in us and with us is greater than
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:39.600]   he that is in and with the world. And now, may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:45.720]   Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:52.600]   and continue with us now throughout the remainder of this hour, short and certain, earthly life
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:58.720]   and pilgrimage and evermore. Amen.
