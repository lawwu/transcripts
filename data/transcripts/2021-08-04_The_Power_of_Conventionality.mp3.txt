[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.720]   Although today I should simply say welcome to conventional personal finance.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   I'm your host.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.180]   This is a show dedicated to helping you live a rich and meaningful life while steadily
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.360]   working towards the good life, enjoying it both now and achieving your goals for financial
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.320]   freedom over the course of several decades.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.000]   Now, of course, that's a different introduction than I usually start the show with.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.760]   But today I think it is an appropriate one because I want to talk today about the power
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.920]   of conventional thinking and also conventional financial planning.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.240]   Let me begin with a bit of philosophical introspection that I have been engaged in quite a bit over
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.560]   the last few days and I try to make this a continual bit of introspection, especially
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.280]   over the last few years.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.400]   Thinking broadly, I think that one of the dangerous trends of youthful revolutionaries
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.840]   and in that camp, I would count myself at certain times, and also of many leading voices
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:23.560]   in many industries is we tend to ignore the wisdom of the past.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.320]   Without question, I myself have been guilty of this at many times in my life.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.040]   I come across an idea that excites me.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.600]   I come across something where I think, "Oh, this is phenomenal and we should just change
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.760]   everything."
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.240]   And then perhaps you go down the path a little ways and you discover that actually there
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.520]   is a good deal of wisdom in what most people were doing.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.720]   Over the years, I've shared with you various podcasts and one of those I talked about why
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.360]   I have decided that I am not interested in being a revolutionary.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.000]   Rather, I'm interested in being a reformer.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.240]   Now speaking broadly, I have come to the opinion that most revolutions are mistakes.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.760]   Revolution is exceedingly dangerous.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.000]   Revolution takes down one system and replaces it with something entirely new and that something
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.160]   that's entirely new is often untested and sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:43.680]   It can perhaps lead to a bold story that indicates success, but oftentimes it leads to a collapse.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.960]   And I don't think it's safe.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.240]   I don't think the outcomes of virtually any revolution are worth the way that they're
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   achieved.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.840]   Rather, I think that reformation is the proper and productive path.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.680]   Change is necessary in many parts of society and many parts of a life, but reformation
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.480]   will in many cases lead to better results.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.040]   I want to be cautious not to make too many blanket statements.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.800]   There may indeed be times in your own life where a complete and total transformation,
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.080]   a complete and total revolution does lead to better results, at least on a personal
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.400]   level.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.120]   But whenever you look broadly, I think that often reformation is better.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.280]   Now I've articulated that concept before.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.480]   Today though, I want to apply it to the concept of simply understanding why certain systems
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.440]   exist.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.520]   Let me share a business example and then an ecological example from first my own life
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:55.280]   and also from just observing how systems change over time.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.860]   When I was in college, there was a book published.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.480]   It was never a popular book.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.280]   It was just a book I found browsing through the bookstore and the title grabbed me.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.200]   I bought it, read it, and was impressed by it.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.000]   The book was called "Why Work Sucks and How to Fix It."
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.680]   At this point, I don't even remember the author's name.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:26.040]   It was two ladies who wrote this book articulating many people's frustrations with work.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:33.160]   They advocated in that book for what they termed a results-only work environment.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.440]   The idea was we should discard any kind of corporate slavery.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.000]   We should discard stated schedules, fixed office locations, and we should hold people
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.920]   accountable exclusively for the results that they achieve in their job.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.560]   At the time, their success story that they were pointing to was the corporate headquarters
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.640]   of Best Buy.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.960]   That book impressed me deeply, and the authors articulated certain things that I wanted to
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.120]   be true for myself.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.440]   At the time, I was working in a salaried job where I was expected to be there from about
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.320]   8.30 to 5 o'clock, something like that.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.480]   I was expected to show up in the office to do my work on regular times, to stay a little
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.520]   bit late and get the work done when I needed to be there.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.960]   With my personality, that didn't feel great.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.400]   I remember distinctly something that those authors wrote in that book about how the modern
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.720]   corporate environment causes people to have to lie to their bosses to justify being 20
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.020]   minutes late to work.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.160]   You come in and instead of arriving at 8.30, you arrive at 8.50.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   "Oh, sorry.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.160]   The traffic was really bad."
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.360]   In reality, you were sitting at home with your family eating blueberry pancakes, and
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.280]   you just wanted to stay and eat blueberry pancakes.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.260]   Their point was you're an adult.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.160]   You should be allowed to do your tasks on your own time.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.520]   Now, I succeeded in my own career of moving into an environment, especially an entrepreneurial
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.360]   environment that included complete and total time freedom and location freedom where I
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.080]   didn't ever have bosses.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:21.160]   From the time I left that job, now going on 15 years, I have not been accountable to a
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.840]   boss for where and when I work.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.800]   That was important to me, and I wanted that sense of personal freedom.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   Hear me clearly.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.280]   I like that personal freedom.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.560]   It means a lot to me.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.480]   It's something that I would be quite loathe to give up.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:48.320]   But having achieved that, I find it fascinating how much my life looks like the life of a
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.160]   conventional employee, a conventional salaryman.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.720]   I tend to work from about 9 a.m. to about 5 p.m.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.400]   I usually work Monday through Friday.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.120]   I find that working in an office is where I work best.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.240]   So although I could go and sit at a cafe in some beautiful seaside resort, I choose not
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   to do that.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.320]   I don't like it at the moment.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:22.600]   I have rented a co-working space for the last few weeks I've been working here in Malta,
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.560]   renting a co-working space, sitting and working at a desk just like I did so many years ago.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560]   I don't go to the beach.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.000]   I don't go to the beautiful cafe.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.200]   I don't go to anywhere except a desk in an office.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.640]   I sit down at the desk.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.800]   I get up in the morning.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.520]   My family and I, we have breakfast together.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   I kiss my wife.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.520]   I walk to work.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   I sit down at my office.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.880]   I work until about 5 o'clock or 5.30.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.480]   Then I pack up my stuff and I go home.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:56.600]   Now I'm not saying that there aren't days that it's really nice not to have to do that.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:07.000]   What I'm saying is when I was 20 years old, I didn't appreciate the power of the conventional
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   lifestyle.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.800]   I didn't appreciate that people had developed this salaried lifestyle because it was a pretty
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.520]   good way of doing things.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.560]   Rather, I wanted to toss the whole thing out on its head.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.200]   I wanted to be a radical revolutionary and say, "I'm not going to live that way.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.760]   I'm going to live the four-hour work week."
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:34.000]   Interestingly, although I haven't followed it closely, I believe that the experiment
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.560]   at Best Buy of their results-only work environment, the thing that the book was written about
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.020]   was a fairly short-lived experiment.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.240]   They did it for a few years.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:50.720]   They weren't getting good results from it and they scrapped that idea.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:57.160]   They imposed more structure and order on the functioning of their company.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.000]   Fast forward to today in 2021, the entire world has changed.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.040]   Remote working is the norm.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:10.040]   But there are a lot of remote workers who want to go back into the office.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.640]   As offices have opened and will open, there are a lot of workers who are glad to go into
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:22.880]   their desks, sit down at 830 in the morning, work at their computer, and leave at 5 o'clock.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:34.180]   There was, perhaps, a list of small changes that needed to happen that have now happened.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:42.600]   But the changes over the last 15 years have looked more like a reformation of sorts rather
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.320]   than a whole-scale revolution.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.300]   I today appreciate more than I ever did why a company should have a physical headquarters,
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.600]   why many, if not most, employees in the company should be gathered together in a physical
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.020]   space.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:04.540]   I appreciate why we people work better when they're physically together as part of a team,
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:10.620]   everyone working at the same schedule on the same tasks in the shared space.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.820]   There's a power in that.
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:23.400]   And as I think about my own businesses, I'm loathe to actually try to build an entirely
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.080]   remote distributed workforce.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.860]   There are companies that are still doing it, but I'm not convinced that it's categorically
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.960]   a superior model.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.940]   I think it can work for certain functions within a company, but it's not the best way
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.100]   that all companies should be run.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.220]   It's not.
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:47.580]   So before we dismantle the old system, we should try to understand it a little bit.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:53.580]   That leads me to the ecological example that I want to use.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:11:03.140]   Over the years, I have come to appreciate ancient cultures far more than I ever did.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:09.840]   By ancient cultures, I mean traditional cultures within the recent past, and I mean genuinely
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.200]   ancient cultures.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:19.580]   Our forebears were in many cases men and women of tremendous wisdom.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:27.600]   And the systems, the ancient systems of life in a local place often had a tremendous wisdom
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.400]   associated with it.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.380]   Even if they couldn't articulate why they do certain things in a certain way, the fact
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.820]   that they did those things that way, there was a reason behind it, even if the person
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.940]   involved couldn't articulate it.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:49.560]   And one thing that I get very concerned about in our day is in many parts of our societies,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.860]   there is something of a revolutionary spirit.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:58.940]   People who are operating under the assumption and idea that virtually everything from the
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.820]   past was marred, was broken, was wrong, was wrongheaded.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.340]   And now we are the enlightened generation, and as the enlightened generation, we should
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:14.620]   wholeheartedly revolt against the oppression and strictures and bonds of the past and replace
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:20.980]   those things in the past with a completely better, improved system.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.640]   Count me out.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:31.540]   It's not that I reject the need for reformation, but before we reform, we need to understand
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:37.460]   what works about the past and why.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.280]   I said I wanted to use an ecological example.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:48.540]   Before I give a farming example, let me talk about something like cities.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:55.900]   I'm fascinated by intelligent engineering and design.
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.080]   It's a real interest of mine.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.080]   I have followed for years, there is a Twitter account, and there are many others, but there's
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.640]   a uniquely interesting Twitter account.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.000]   If you're not following it, I encourage you to consider it.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.080]   It's called Wrath of Non.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.440]   I don't know where that particular screen handle, what it even alludes to, but it's
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:20.700]   called Wrath, W-R-A-T-H of Non, G-N-O-N.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:26.800]   But the anonymous person behind this Twitter account does a very good job of systematically
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:35.240]   profiling the beauty and intelligence of how towns and cities have been constructed for
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:42.080]   millennia and of quite rightly pilloring how we do these things in the modern era.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.880]   And I have been interested over the last couple of weeks, as I said, I've been here in Malta
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.720]   and I have been touring some of the ancient cities here.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.320]   And there are some classic cities.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.360]   What's interesting to me about Malta, Malta is a very hot place, especially here.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.360]   I'm here in the summertime.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:04.240]   It's very hot, it's very dry, and it's an exceedingly unpleasant place during the daytime,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.840]   at least for someone like me, who is not quite as bronzed of a god as I would like to be,
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.760]   and for whom the sun is oftentimes quite unpleasant.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:23.680]   So you can walk around in most parts of Malta, and while it is without question a very pretty
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.720]   place, it's right on the Mediterranean, the island has curves galore, buildings everywhere,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.480]   it's got a lovely European culture, it appeals to tourists, it's a very beautiful place.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.520]   But when you are looking around and walking around, it's a very unpleasant place because
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.120]   of the heat.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.360]   And you feel like you're in these different zones.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.160]   You have the commercial zone and then you have the residential zone.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.800]   So that is, of course, that you travel to one of the ancient cities, and there are a
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:04.520]   number of them, but two popular ones are the city of Limdina, formerly the capital of Malta,
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.480]   and the city of Valletta.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.040]   And both of these cities are ancient walled cities.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.800]   They are absolutely amazing to be in.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:22.200]   They're walled all around, but what you find is that they are very pleasant places to be.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.080]   It's not that they haven't been updated.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   They have been, right?
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.160]   There are now shops with pretty glass windows and whatnot.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.680]   They look a little bit different than they would have looked 600 years ago, but they
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.120]   are pleasant places to be in.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:44.320]   And what strikes me is the value of something as mundane as very narrow streets.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.560]   Now having been interested in architecture a little bit and trying to understand this,
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:55.400]   this is something where I have changed my mind drastically on because now I understand
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.960]   the wisdom that is behind narrow streets.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:04.400]   In 2013, I was living in downtown West Palm Beach, Florida, and at the time, right next
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.920]   to my house, there was a very nice big road.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:14.680]   By nice big, I mean classic American four-lane road, easy flow of traffic, easy cars, and
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.920]   it was in the downtown area.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.520]   It worked really well.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.400]   And then one day I come along and there are construction vehicles, and there's a guy out
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:30.480]   there with a chipping hammer attached to the front of a tractor of some kind, and he's
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.920]   out there chipping and sawing the concrete up in the middle of the road.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:42.200]   And the city workers came in, they tore up a perfectly good road, and they put in medians,
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.360]   and they dropped it from four lanes down to two.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.960]   And they put in these medians full of bushes and trees and whatnot, and they finished their
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   work and they left.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:57.680]   And at the time, I was quite self-righteous about it, and in my indignation, I said, "This
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.800]   is typical.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.720]   These government people, they just want to spend money unnecessarily, and they come in
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:08.800]   here and they take a perfectly good road, and they go and spend money wrecking a perfectly
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   good road."
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.960]   And I felt quite self-righteous about it.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.840]   I felt quite confident in my opinion.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   I was wrong, and the engineers who did that were right.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:26.280]   Because today, because of the restraint on traffic flow, the fact that now not as many
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.480]   cars can get through, the cars that do get through have to drive more slowly, it's made
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.280]   it a much more pleasant place.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.720]   And I found that the city planners and engineers now know this, that if you want to create
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.240]   community, you need to slow down traffic and make it unpleasant for cars to go through.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.320]   And so one of the best things that you can do to create a center of economic activity
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:57.120]   is get the cars out, slow the streets down, lower things, make it small, make it tight,
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.680]   restrict the flow of traffic so that there can be life, because nobody wants to do business
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.020]   next to a busy road.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.000]   Nobody wants to walk next to a busy road, et cetera.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.440]   And so now, if you look at modern urban planners and urban design, there will be a greater
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.320]   appreciation of this.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.240]   Well, to appreciate this, all you need to do is go and look at some of the places that
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.360]   we love to be, right?
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.640]   Go and look at an ancient European city, an ancient Asian city, something preferably more
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:31.840]   than 500 years old, and you'll find that it looks very different than our modern developments.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.360]   Now today, we are in a time, which I'm quite happy about, where people think much more
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.920]   about sustainable design.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:49.520]   But what's ironic is a lot of modern sustainable design is quite the opposite, right?
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.080]   There's the greenwashing of many new products and many new ideas.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:19:01.120]   And if you really want to get sustainable design, you should look to the past and understand
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.960]   what worked then, because chances are what worked in the past would probably actually
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.120]   work really well today.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:16.640]   And you walk through a city like Limdina here in Malta, and I wrote to Wrath of Non on Twitter.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.880]   I said, "I've been in Limdina.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.880]   You're right.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.120]   I would love to live in this city.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.840]   The city is hundreds of years old."
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.840]   It's not been updated.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.720]   There's some...
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.480]   The walls are the original stone.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.480]   They're not been painted.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.200]   They've not been covered.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.360]   Most of the streets are...
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.680]   The original streets are a similar style.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.200]   They didn't take out the ancient cobblestones and put in beautiful tile anywhere.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.760]   It's just the ancient technology.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.760]   And I...
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.880]   Yes, they've added electricity, which certainly I would want.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.080]   I'm sure there's a little bit of climate control, but you walk down those streets and it's
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.800]   a pleasant place to be.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.800]   Why?
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.440]   Well, because the streets are narrow, then they're shaded.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.440]   This is the point.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.960]   I should have made it more clear earlier.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.280]   You have these narrow streets.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.240]   And yes, they were designed in a time before cars.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.280]   But because the streets are narrow, the streets are pleasant places to be.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:18.760]   And I could imagine all of the economic activity that would have occurred in those ancient
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.920]   days right in those streets, because they're narrow, they're shaded, they're cool, they're
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.040]   comfortable.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.800]   Modern Malta is not that.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.160]   The modern streets, even though again, it's because of this ancient development, a lot
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.760]   of the streets are very small, you're forever trying to find a spot of shade.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.360]   It's just unpleasant.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.320]   And so you hit about four o'clock, five o'clock in the evening, and now you think, "I can
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.320]   go out."
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:49.040]   Well, we can improve things.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.040]   We really can.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.920]   But before we go about improving, we would be wise to sit and learn.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:01.080]   Number of years ago, I was deeply interested in permaculture design, which is a form of
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.680]   thinking and design that's applied to usually food production, although it can be viewed
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   comprehensively.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:15.440]   And I took several classes and consumed dozens or hundreds of hours of instruction by a designer,
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.800]   an Australian permaculture designer named Jeff Lawton, amazing guy.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.600]   Had stumbled across him on the internet.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:27.080]   He had done this phenomenal, phenomenal video, very old, but still out there called "Greening
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.600]   the Desert," where he went into the Jordan Valley, a place that was completely and utterly
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   destroyed, and he put in a green oasis and just simply used good design to turn the desert
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.800]   into a green oasis.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.260]   It was amazing.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:50.280]   And when I saw that, it filled me with a sense of optimism because I thought, "If that guy,
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:56.400]   operating on virtually no budget, can come in years ago, install this kind of beautiful
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.600]   design, there's no place in the world that we can't green.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.880]   There's no desert that we can't beat back, and there's no ecological problem that we
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.560]   can't solve."
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.760]   I genuinely believe that.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:12.000]   I have no fear whatsoever of thinking that there's any ecological problem that we can't
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.560]   solve because I've seen intelligent designers work miracles, genuine miracles.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:26.080]   Well, Lawton stressed in his teaching the importance of understanding ancient designs.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.440]   Before you go in and you just start cutting everything down, understand why does this
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.520]   exist?
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.640]   What is it about this place?
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:40.000]   Before you come in and you just raise an entire forest, cutting every tree, every vine, etc.,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   down and plant fields because there's a lot of rain here, understand the fact that it's
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.540]   the forest itself that creates the rain.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.480]   And so what happens in a lot of places is you have this modern mindset that comes in
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.320]   and says, "We're going to get rid of the forest, and we're going to replace it with fields
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.320]   because this is a great place to grow more crops, and with our large, massive amounts
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.720]   of agriculture equipment, we can build a huge farm here that would be very productive."
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.160]   So you come in and you cut down the forest and you put in the farm, but then you turn
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.040]   around and a few years later, you're living in a dust bowl.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   Why?
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.160]   Well, because the forest created the rain, and you didn't understand the fact that it
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.000]   was the forest itself that was creating the rain.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.200]   And so that's not to say that you shouldn't have cut down the forest.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.860]   There's a place and a time to cut down the forests, but you need to first understand
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:30.400]   how the forest works and then put in the appropriate measures to keep some of the forest.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.880]   Maybe you do strip farming, right?
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.160]   You put your farms in other places.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.480]   You think about what's there, understand how the system works to the best of your degree
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.680]   why it works, and don't come in and be a revolutionary.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.400]   Otherwise you might wind up with tremendous problems.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:51.960]   Now I feel the same way now going the opposite direction.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:57.440]   And as I'm getting older, again, I try, I know I'm not good, but I try to do my best
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.200]   to be a self-aware person, right?
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.360]   To think carefully about what I believe and why, and then to constantly test those things.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:10.360]   And I do my best to respect you as a listener and articulate the things that I believe in
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:15.500]   such a way that you can understand not only what the opinion is, but why it is so.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.760]   And then you can decide if that line of thinking is something that serves you.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.640]   This was what always annoyed me years ago before I started creating Radical Personal
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.640]   Finance.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.000]   Somebody would say dogmatically, "This is the reason behind this certain..."
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.640]   Sorry, they would say, "You do this, right?
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.840]   Always do this with your money."
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.960]   Instead of articulating, "I think you should do this and here's why," so that I can understand,
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:45.960]   "Okay, that reasoning, that thinking applies or doesn't apply to my situation."
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:57.640]   So even now, I look and I realize that same thoughtful respect of the past is important.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.600]   So I beat on a moment ago, industrial-level agriculture, right?
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:10.160]   I do not believe that industrial agriculture should be eliminated.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.020]   That would be the revolutionary spirit.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.480]   That would be catastrophic, right?
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.960]   If we came in and I were emperor of the world and I said, "That's it.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.320]   I can see that these giant monocrop farms, these giant estates, these are bad.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.000]   And so as emperor of the world, I'm passing an edict that says they're now banned."
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   People, we would starve, right?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.400]   We would absolutely starve.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:37.760]   I don't want to whole-scale eliminate industrial agriculture.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.000]   The change should occur at the margin and there should be steady change.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   So you can look and say, "Why does industrial agriculture work?"
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.180]   Don't just dismiss it until you understand it and then say, "How can we make it better?"
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:54.340]   And human beings applying their engineering thinking to these problems will improve things
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:59.040]   systematically over time.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:04.520]   The revolutionary spirit that sweeps something aside is something that may be interesting,
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.480]   it may be entertaining, and there may be some of us who actually do enjoy that, right?
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   Being the revolutionaries.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   In fact, often perhaps those people are necessary.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.960]   They're activists, they're agitators, they're people who come in and do something so radically
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:25.600]   different that they can bring attention and carve out a different path.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.480]   I personally, by personality, am often attracted to those people.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.120]   There's a reason my podcast is called Radical Personal Finance.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.080]   But now that I've laid the foundation, I want to talk about the power of conventional personal
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.600]   finance because if I'm going to be honest and consistent with everything that I have
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.480]   said, then I should apply the same basic principle to my own thinking and say, "Before I come
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.920]   in as the radical personal finance guru, the revolutionary who's going to say, 'Build
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.800]   a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less,' or 'Start your own business and become
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.360]   a multi-billionaire,' or 'Live like a wacko in an RV,' or something like that, I should
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:11.040]   understand why the systems that be work and what works well about them because only then
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:18.800]   can I properly identify the changes that could perhaps improve things and then articulate
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:24.440]   to somebody what changes they might want to consider."
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:31.080]   So let me begin with financial freedom.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:39.520]   Long-time listeners know that one radical revolutionary idea that I have mostly rejected
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:46.520]   has been the joy of not working, to steal the title of Ernie Zelinsky's book, which
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.080]   I've read and actually like.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:59.840]   I believe that the revolutionary spirit around financial freedom, financial independence,
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:08.400]   free retirement, etc., is in many cases an overreaction to a modern work environment
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:15.840]   that can indeed place heavy burdens on its participants.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:21.080]   Now this is not one where I've never been a loudmouth advocate to say, "Don't work,"
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.060]   but I wanted to articulate this one because it is something I see around.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:29.760]   There are a lot of people who genuinely believe that if they could just get rid of work, they're
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:36.240]   lives would be better, and I don't think that is true.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:47.320]   Now I have a personal theological conviction that man is meant, meaning designed, to work,
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.720]   and that work is not a curse.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.720]   Work is a blessing.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:59.120]   I do think the use of that word "work" can be a very wide and expansive application.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:06.560]   I don't think that work is work only if you receive financial compensation for it.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.720]   I don't think that work has to be done in an office.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.200]   I don't think that work has to be knowledge work or physical work.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   And so I'm not an advocate that somebody has to stay in a corporate job in order for them
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.160]   to experience all of the joys of working.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.440]   That's not the case.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.580]   There are many people who have become financially independent.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.800]   They don't need to work for money, and they decide that, "I'm going to invest my labors
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.160]   into something else.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.680]   I'm going to invest my labors into my community.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.760]   I'm going to invest my labors into my grandchildren.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.560]   I'm going to invest my labors into my garden."
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.400]   The world is open.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.120]   What I do think is important to articulate is that work is not a curse.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:30:01.920]   And in fact, even some of the most stereotypical work, in my opinion, is actually quite valuable.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:13.840]   As I reflected on this, I realized I miss, I genuinely miss the normal corporate work
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.200]   environment.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.920]   I genuinely miss going to work and seeing my friends every day.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   My sister used to say why she goes to work.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.160]   She said, "I go to work to see my friends every day."
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.680]   And at the time I would laugh at her, but you know what?
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   She's right.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.920]   I genuinely miss it.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:35.440]   I feel isolated doing the independent entrepreneur thing, far more so than I ever thought that
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.640]   I would be.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:43.400]   And while I'm not changing exclusively for that reason, and while I am seeking to make
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:49.400]   sure that I don't remain isolated, it's funny how when I think about the corporate environment,
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:54.920]   I think about going and taking a job, working in an office, one of the things that I realize
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:00.800]   I would appreciate is having that structured social environment.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.260]   It's a tremendous benefit, a tremendous, just simple system.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.560]   And the fact that everyone is all together, the fact that everyone is together at the
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:12.840]   same time, the fact that everyone's in one place, and that there's a diversity of people
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:19.200]   at all different levels coming together to work on the same thing, this is fun.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.320]   This is something that is useful.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.640]   Again, my revolutionary spirit, when I was younger, I thought, "Well, the dream is just
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.720]   going to be me and a laptop, because if I could go with my laptop and I can make money
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:37.320]   around the world, then I can go wherever I want and I can be in the most fun place."
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:43.840]   And I'm glad that I did it, but I miss the corporate work environment.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.220]   So if you're part of a company where you're expected to come to work at a certain time,
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.760]   you're expected to be there, I want to encourage you not to...
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.040]   There's a word.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.800]   In Spanish, the word is "menospreciar."
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.400]   I don't know how to translate that word.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:10.440]   Basically it means to diminish, to not appreciate, to cast off without consideration, to despise.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.960]   I guess that would be the best translation, to despise it.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.360]   Don't despise that.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.420]   There's a good chance that if you're working a job, diligently salting away your money,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.920]   planning for the day of your financial freedom, there's a good chance that on the day that
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.320]   you declare your independence, you submit your resignation and you leave that job, you're
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.520]   going to feel a sense of euphoria.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.920]   There's a very good chance that a week later, when you're sitting on your balcony, drinking
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.840]   your morning coffee, lazing about, reading books and swiping through your Instagram feed,
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.380]   without the need to go to the office, you're going to be even happier with your decision.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:46.280]   And there's a very good chance that one or two years later, after you declared your independence
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:51.440]   from the corporate system, you're going to look back fondly and wish that you could be
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:59.120]   on the same schedule as everyone else, sitting in traffic, going back to your corporate job.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:07.320]   So while you're in it, recognize that the conventional lifestyle of going to work is
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.320]   not a bad thing.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:18.160]   I remember years ago, I had a meeting with my managing director at Northwestern Mutual,
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.960]   where I used to work when I was a financial advisor.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.320]   And my managing director was a neat guy.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.640]   When I came along, he was at the end of his career.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:32.820]   And at the time, I think it's still the case, but at the time, that company had mandatory
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:36.920]   retirement for all management personnel at the age of 65.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.960]   And so he knew that he was going to be retired at that time.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:46.960]   And he was a very successful managing director within that system.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:52.840]   He had built an insurance office, he had insurance agents working for him, investment office,
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.840]   et cetera.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:59.800]   And that business is, as far as I'm concerned, just a wonderful business, because it integrates
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.320]   so many good things.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.600]   It gives you control over your time, freedom, gives you massive financial compensation,
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.640]   especially in the latter end of your career.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.200]   And he was and had been at the peak of his career.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.360]   He had a lot of money.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.320]   He earned a lot of money without a whole lot of difficulty.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.680]   He had all the toys, right?
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.720]   He had the nice cars, a nice motorcycle, had an airplane, had a boat, you know, a nice
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.160]   boat, all the stuff, beautiful house on the water.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.240]   He had all the stuff.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:29.640]   And he was facing up at his mandatory retirement at 65.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:34.960]   And so he retired at 65, but he took a consulting job, continuing to work just as an independent
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.400]   consultant within the same system.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:44.160]   And I remember talking to him, we were close, and he made a comment to me about how glad
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:50.480]   he was to still have that job, meaning the consulting job.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:57.120]   And he said, "I derive a lot of satisfaction and a significant degree of my self-worth
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.040]   from my identity as a businessman."
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.160]   Articulated just like that.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.960]   I'll never forget that because the older I get, the more I've seen that.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:13.680]   Especially, I think this affects men more than women, but there have been so many times
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:18.320]   where I've coached with a retiree, right?
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.760]   Somebody who's 64 years old.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.120]   And that person, you know, that man is at the peak of his career, is at the zenith of
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.560]   his achievement.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:32.520]   He's respected, he's admired, he's well-paid, he is appreciated, his perspective is appreciated.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.400]   And then often he'll retire.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.560]   Pull out of that system.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.040]   "Hey, what do you do?"
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.720]   "I'm retired."
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:47.040]   Loses contact with friends, loses contact with people in that business social circle,
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:52.000]   loses a sense of contribution to the community around, the company at hand.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.120]   It's not a thing to be taken lightly.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:02.360]   How much more if you do that at 30?
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:07.040]   What's the next thing that perhaps the power of conventional thinking?
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:13.600]   Here I would say the conventional power of a job.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:19.560]   I don't see myself as the kind of person who is well-suited for a job.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.280]   I don't.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.600]   I like being an entrepreneur.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.840]   I like the freedom, I like the flexibility, etc.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:30.120]   But there's not a week that goes by that I don't think very carefully and ask myself,
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.120]   "Am I wrong?
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:37.360]   Couldn't I just go and be better off having a job?"
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   A job is a wonderful thing.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:50.080]   A job is one of the most rewarding things that you can do because it simplifies your
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.560]   life.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.160]   When you are a boss or an entrepreneur, you come in so frequently, you sit down, look
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.560]   at a blank piece of paper and you have to figure out what plan, what design, what to
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.480]   build on that piece of paper.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.040]   I find that frequently overwhelming.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.040]   I don't know.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.480]   And even though I'm very good at goal setting, I'm very good at saying this is what I want,
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:18.360]   even though I'm a world-class planner and can often see pathways through complex situations,
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.040]   I look at a blank sheet of paper every morning and sometimes I just can't figure out what
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.320]   to do.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:28.440]   And I long and I wish, I just wish somebody would tell me what to do.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.160]   Because then if somebody would tell me what to do and then I simply do it, I can have
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.480]   the confidence knowing I've done what I needed to do today.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:41.600]   When I was a boy, my dad said, "Joshua, when you go to work, find out who your boss is,
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.120]   figure out what your boss wants and figure it and make him happy and then you're done."
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.560]   And I've always applied that, right?
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.120]   And as an employee, it's a wonderfully simple thing to do.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:55.280]   You go into work, find out what your boss wants and you do it.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.640]   And when you do what your boss wants, your boss is happy, you walk out of work feeling
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.120]   like I did a good job, I'm done.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:06.520]   And you can leave the office with a clear heart, clear head.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.120]   The lifestyle of an entrepreneur is not that way.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.600]   As an entrepreneur, you come to the office, you sit down, you try to figure out what to
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.800]   do, you do it, you wonder, is this good enough?
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.600]   But who do I ask?
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.600]   There's no one that I can ask.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   I'm the one that's responsible.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:26.720]   I'm responsible for everything, the vision, everything.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   So I'm here to tell you that having a job where you're an employee is actually a really
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.280]   wonderful thing.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.720]   In addition, it's a wonderful thing in your personal finances.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:46.360]   I don't withdraw from my opinion that if you want to become wealthy, one of the best ways
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:51.160]   to become wealthy is to build a business that makes a lot of money and/or build a career
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.160]   that makes a lot of money.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:57.040]   And in fact, most of your first investments should be into your income.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   I believe that's true.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.880]   And as far as I can tell, it's almost undeniable.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:09.880]   However, there are so many things that are better in a conventional path, a conventional
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:17.320]   path of simply having a salary, having a paycheck.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.880]   Let me articulate some of those so perhaps you'll appreciate what you have.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:26.080]   The first thing is you have the ability to plan.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:31.520]   For me personally, since the time that I was 21 years old, I have never been able to do
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:36.600]   a budget in the traditional sense.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.840]   Took me years to be okay with that because when I was a teenager, I'd read books about
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.840]   doing a budget.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.600]   You do zero dollar budgeting.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.320]   You sit down, you figure out how much money you have coming in, figure out where it's
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.880]   going, and then you write down what your thing should be.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.040]   And I remember when I was in college, I had an income and it was wonderful.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:55.160]   I would sit down, I had my income, I knew how much it was going to be, I was a salaried
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.640]   employee, I would do my budget, I'd pay my bills.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.280]   I remember it was very simple.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:06.000]   I'd pay my rent, I had a certain amount for gas, but it was really predictable in terms
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.160]   of how much I was driving.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.360]   And I think I had my food bill, as I remember it was $200.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.320]   And so I would just put $200 of cash in my wallet and I knew that for food and fun, I'm
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.080]   going to spend $200 over the course of this month.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:23.200]   And it was so freeing to go out to eat, knowing that if there's money in my wallet, I can
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.720]   spend it.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.120]   And if there's not, I can't.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.920]   It was so freeing to know that if there's money here, I can do it because there'll be
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.220]   more money next month.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.480]   And I could spend money guilt-free because I had planned where the money was going to
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   go.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.000]   Well, then I became an entrepreneur.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.520]   And there would be some months where I would make $0 and there would be some months where
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.000]   I'd make tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.080]   That's a crazy thing to deal with on a daily basis because it makes it very difficult to
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.000]   know where to draw the lines.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.460]   And you have this tension between frugality and enjoyment.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:07.140]   You want to be frugal because you know that frugality is a useful tool along the journey
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.220]   to wealth.
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.840]   But on the other hand, you want to enjoy your money and you want to spend on peak experiences
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.700]   and on peak things.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:18.500]   And a lot of times, the times that you want to spend the money don't line up.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.500]   Maybe you have a $30,000 month and you're thinking, "Great.
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.500]   Awesome.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.500]   I've got a $30,000 month.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.680]   This was great."
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.460]   And so you go out to eat.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.880]   Okay, fine.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.220]   Maybe you go out to eat, nice restaurant, spend money, feel really good about it.
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.820]   But then what about the next month?
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.900]   You had a $30,000 month the previous month.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.980]   The next month, you have a $0 month.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.260]   Do you still do it?
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.100]   Well you're thinking, "Okay, well I made $15,000 between the two months."
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.600]   But then what about the fourth month?
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.460]   You know that in the fifth month, you could make a hundred grand.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:52.140]   But in the fourth month, now your wage is averaged out.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:56.220]   If you had a $30,000 month that took you for four months, now you're down to like seven
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.220]   grand a month.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.540]   Now you don't feel so flush.
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.780]   I've lived this since I was 21 years old.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.060]   Now I like it.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:09.740]   I like it because it inspires me with a confidence to know that whatever it is that I want, I
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.320]   can make a plan to do it.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:15.700]   If I went back and took a job, it would annoy me because I would not know how.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.740]   It's like, "Okay, I want to buy a new toy.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.180]   I want to buy a fancy thing.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.940]   I want to buy, I don't know, a Ford Raptor pickup truck, something fancier.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.580]   I want to buy a Tesla or I want to buy a boat."
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.500]   Well, in my world, I can look at a boat.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.140]   By the way, I found this.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:37.020]   Beneteau makes this center console cabin cruiser boat.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.260]   My entire life, I have lived in South Florida and I've never understood since I don't enjoy
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.260]   fishing.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.620]   I have never understood why everyone buys center console boats.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.140]   They're uncomfortable unless you're fishing.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.140]   They're designed for fishing.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.140]   They're great for fishing.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.980]   But the thing is people buy this fishing boat and they use it 90% of the time for partying
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.980]   and they use it 10% of the time for fishing.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.980]   I don't like center console boats.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:05.460]   I finally came across this last week across the Beneteau line of basically small cabin
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.460]   cruiser.
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.460]   You can get a 34-foot boat.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.900]   It's got two small cabins on it.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.740]   If you're into boats, you're looking for a lifestyle boat to put behind your Fort Lauderdale
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.220]   house, check out the Beneteau.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:16.900]   I forget the brand name on it.
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:21.020]   But anyway, I can come across that and I can look at that and I can say, "This boat is
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.020]   awesome."
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.020]   Right?
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.020]   "300 grand?
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.020]   All right, no big deal.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.020]   Okay, how am I going to make 300 grand?"
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.940]   I think it was 300 grand, something like that.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.300]   To me, I love that sense.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.980]   I love that sense of excitement to know that there is literally nothing that I could say
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:44.320]   to myself that I want and don't have that I can't figure out how to get because my income
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:50.060]   potential is unlimited and it allows me to live in this very pleasant, dreamy world of
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:56.420]   opportunity to go around the world and to be completely and totally unencumbered by
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:02.260]   constraints on my financial thinking because I know that no matter what the thing is that
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.660]   I want, I can figure out a way to do it.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.100]   It's awesome.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.840]   It's also brutal, right?
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.180]   Because there's those other times when things aren't going well and you really love to know
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.700]   when you're going to be able to achieve the goal.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:23.900]   And a normal person can say, "I want to pay off my $300,000 house," and you can sit down
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.700]   and you can calculate, "All right, if I'll pay an extra $2,000 a month, I'll have my
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.500]   $300,000 house paid off in four years."
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:34.540]   And you can scrimp and you can save and you can be frugal and you can feel really good
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.980]   about that because you know you're making progress towards a goal.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:39.980]   You can say no to yourself.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:44.740]   Like one of the things that I used to do, I used to, if I said no, I'd go out to eat
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.460]   and I wanted to buy a $9 glass of wine but I just felt like, "Eh, that's a little excessive.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.140]   I don't need to buy a $9 glass of wine."
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:55.140]   And so I would pull out my phone and I would transfer $9 from my checking account to my
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.140]   savings account.
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.820]   And I'd be like, "Okay, I didn't buy the glass of wine so there's $9 more available in my
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.940]   financial freedom fund."
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.700]   That's a nice thing to know that you're going to achieve it.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.460]   And then you hit it.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.620]   And you have the joy of knowing, "I hit that goal."
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:17.160]   And the ability to plan a fairly direct path from here to there through budgeting because
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.740]   you have a regular salary is a wonderful thing.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:25.340]   The ability to leave your work and go home and feel good knowing that, "Hey, the work
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.400]   was there," is a wonderful thing.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.380]   Even if your job is difficult, even if you don't like it, I'm going to encourage you
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.500]   if you don't care for your job to change to a different job.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:41.100]   I just want to tell you that the conventional thinking behind having a job is not wrong.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.220]   There's a lot of wisdom behind it.
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.140]   What about the good life?
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:50.100]   There are a lot of people whose parents have been very wealthy.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.180]   I remember years ago I read Tom Stanley's book and he talked about how there were so
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.300]   many – I forget which one it was.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.820]   May have been the Millionaire Mind.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.900]   May have been – I don't remember which one.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:07.120]   But he talked in that book about how there's so many very wealthy entrepreneurs that encourage
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:11.380]   their children to become professionals serving the wealthy.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:16.120]   It's very common that you'll have – Dad builds this mega awesome business.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.620]   He's got dozens or hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:24.420]   But he encourages his son, "Son, why don't you go to dental school and become a dentist?
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:30.660]   Son, why don't you become a lawyer, a state lawyer serving the wealthy people?"
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.660]   I didn't understand.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.620]   I was like, "Why do they do that?
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:37.900]   Why wouldn't you, if you had been very successful in business, why wouldn't you look at your
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.980]   son and say, 'Son, why don't you become an entrepreneur and make yourself a couple
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.120]   hundred million dollars?'
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.780]   After all, the entrepreneur is the one who's done it.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.260]   You know it's possible because you've done it.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.980]   Why would you tell your son, 'Go get a job,' basically a highly paid job?"
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.500]   Well, today I understand it.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:47:01.860]   The entrepreneur knows how if just a few things had changed, the success wouldn't have been
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:02.860]   there.
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:09.260]   If she hadn't met the right person at the right time, she would not have made it.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:17.540]   If the bank had not given three extra months of grace period, everything would have collapsed.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:23.820]   The entrepreneur looks at someone who makes $400,000, $500,000, $800,000 a year and says,
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:29.980]   "You can live a great life on $300,000, $400,000, $800,000 a year.
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.980]   You can do really well.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.980]   You can be really wealthy.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.660]   You can have all the toys.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.820]   You can have it at a young age.
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.980]   It's almost a guaranteed path.
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:40.980]   And the work is great."
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:45.460]   You know, the entrepreneur knows that the idea that somehow you're going to work four
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.820]   hours a week and make millions is nonsense.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:53.340]   The entrepreneur knows the weeks of family vacation that you miss because you're putting
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.340]   things in.
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.500]   The entrepreneur knows the early mornings, the late nights, the flying, getting on a
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:01.800]   flight to go and have breakfast with a guy that you don't really want to go and see but
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.220]   you got to do it.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.900]   The entrepreneur knows that.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.220]   The entrepreneur looks at it and says, "Hey, listen.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:13.140]   You're telling me office hours are from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. four days a week and there's
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:18.220]   a $300,000 paycheck sitting there at the end of the year from a business that's fairly
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.220]   stable?
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:23.780]   Two-thirds of the revenues come in from government payments?
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:28.100]   All of a sudden, that sounds like a pretty good deal."
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:37.060]   So don't let my radical thinking cause you to menos preciar, to despise what you got.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.220]   It's pretty good.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.460]   And I could go on forever.
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.020]   I want to give you a few more examples.
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.980]   Living a stationary lifestyle.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:52.100]   Right now, my family and I are living out of suitcases.
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:59.100]   As I have described previously, we have a total of seven bags.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:06.700]   We have six under seat personal item rolly bags and one backpack and that's it.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:10.860]   Everything else is sitting in the storage unit.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.020]   We're traveling the world.
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:20.860]   We've been in one, two, three, four, five countries on this particular trip and on the
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.940]   road for several months.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:23.940]   I love it.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.460]   I really, really enjoy it.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.660]   I really love some of the experiences.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:33.020]   I really enjoy it.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.220]   It's tough.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.220]   It's tough.
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.220]   Right?
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.220]   COVID has made it especially difficult.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:44.140]   You're always looking and saying, "Where do I want to go?
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.140]   Where am I going to go next?"
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.980]   In the same way that I learned that years ago I wanted to be able to live in any country
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.860]   of the world and then I've realized that's too big.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:53.860]   Right?
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:58.100]   A human being is not capable, is not equipped to say, "I'm going to live in any country
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.100]   of the world."
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:05.180]   It's mind blowing to have that ability and then you look at the world and it's a classic
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.660]   problem of too many choices.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.580]   It's like, "I can't do this.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.100]   I just want – give me three choices.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.460]   Let me choose among the three best options."
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:23.940]   So, the travel is great but travel makes you appreciate home.
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:29.820]   As a kid we would go camping and without fail my mom, every camping trip and my dad would
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:33.380]   always say, "The reason we go camping is so that you appreciate home."
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.020]   I think they're right.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:41.100]   The reason I travel is so that I appreciate home.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:44.900]   For years whenever I've gotten on an airplane and gone somewhere I've always come back home
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.140]   and had a totally new appreciation.
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.660]   Every country it's something different.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:54.660]   When I was in Costa Rica in college I came back home and I had been cured of my car lust
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:57.580]   and I knew that, "Hey, just having a car is awesome."
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.580]   I was in Haiti.
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:05.820]   I came home from Haiti and I just was overwhelmed with a sense of gratitude about how easy it
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:11.340]   was to get a job and how amazing it is to simply have a job.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:17.980]   What a vastly better life to have a job versus being unemployed.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.660]   Go home from – I'm here in Malta.
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.140]   Malta is a wonderful place.
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:26.900]   If I were to go back to the United States I would look around and I'd be like all the
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.460]   simple – the little things.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:33.460]   We have air conditioning in our bedrooms and our hotel room but not in the main room.
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:34.940]   Everything here is done with a mini split system.
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:39.420]   I like mini splits but sometimes you just want your house to be a consistent temperature
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:45.140]   or you want your water faucets to be mixed or you want to be able to buy a meal for less
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.140]   than 12 euros.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:49.140]   That's what, 15 bucks or so.
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.140]   All these little things.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.260]   It just goes on and on and on.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.820]   When we were in the United States a few weeks ago after spending time in Mexico and Costa
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:02.740]   Rica and after two years of living abroad I was just flooded with this sense of everything
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:06.380]   is easy here.
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:13.540]   I tell my wife, it's like everything is easy here.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:20.340]   I think very frequently about moving back to the United States and whenever I do it
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:24.020]   I'm mixed with this – I have these sensations.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:27.740]   Number one is everything would be so easy.
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:32.340]   If I just moved back to the United States everything would be so easy.
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.100]   But then maybe I'm taking the coward's way out, right?
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.300]   I'm taking the easy way out.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.180]   Is that really me?
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:43.180]   So travel, right?
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:48.020]   Someone's living the dream but the dream is full of a lot of stress.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.500]   Not trying to dissuade you from it.
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:50.540]   I wouldn't do that.
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.500]   I'm not one who listens to most people when they try to dissuade me from things.
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:55.780]   I'm one who likes to go and learn from experience.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.940]   But what I do want to do is I want to articulate some things so that if you're in a phase of
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.780]   your life where you don't particularly want to get on an airplane just recognize be here
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:07.300]   now and enjoy this particular phase of life.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:13.460]   The conventional lifestyle – having a house, having a yard, having a swing set, having
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:20.540]   a driveway, having bikes in the garage, having a minivan – this is a really great lifestyle.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:23.420]   It's really great.
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:28.860]   And if you don't understand why more people don't want to live in their car or why more
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:34.580]   people don't want to move to a tropical island somewhere, just recognize it's because – it's
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:35.820]   not because people are stupid.
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:43.500]   It's because that traditional conventional lifestyle is really good.
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:48.500]   The reason that most people live fairly conventional lifestyles where they go to work and they
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:53.860]   buy a house and they work a job and they do that for decades at a time is because it's
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.180]   a really good way to live.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:04.300]   Let's not be those who are so convinced of our perspicacious radicality that we just
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:08.500]   wave our hands and say, "We should dump all of this."
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.660]   Suburbia exists for a reason.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:15.300]   Suburbia exists because there have been many, many people who have looked around and said,
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:20.460]   "That's the kind of lifestyle that I want to live."
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:28.460]   Don't despise the wisdom of other people.
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:33.340]   Don't think that you're the only one who's got to figure it out.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:40.580]   Having a house, living in the suburbs, commuting to a job – these are good things.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:44.740]   These are a good lifestyle.
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:45.740]   Go on down the list.
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:49.540]   Let's talk about things like investments.
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:55.460]   I am one who is interested in finding the highest returning investments.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.140]   I understand the mathematical power of good investments.
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:02.980]   But if you came to me and you said, "Joshua, I've got a job that's a good fit for me.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.860]   I feel satisfied with my work.
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.980]   I make $100,000 a year.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.980]   It's enough for us to have the luxuries that we enjoy.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:16.180]   It's enough for us to be out of – we're not in the poor house.
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:22.620]   We don't struggle with financial insecurity.
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.620]   What should I invest in?"
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:29.060]   My answer is probably going to be, "Yeah, probably your 401(k) with some mutual funds."
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:33.140]   I'll talk to you about some other options.
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:40.940]   But the lifestyle where you got a job, you make six figures, you put aside 15%, 20% of
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:46.820]   your income into a 401(k), you do that over the course of a few decades, build up a few
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:51.820]   million bucks in reserves, this is a really great lifestyle.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:56:00.180]   There is no easier investment plan than simply buying mutual funds.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.740]   It works.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:06.220]   It works.
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.820]   Will it work as well 10 years from now as it has in the last 10 years?
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.420]   You and I don't have a clue.
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.060]   Reality is it works.
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.660]   It's good.
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:20.180]   And it's low stress.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:26.180]   I would ask you if you were in that situation, I would say, "Well, you could go into it pretty
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:27.180]   heavy, right?
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:31.980]   You could go and say, 'I'm going to buy 10 rental houses,' or 'I'm going to start a side
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:32.980]   hustle.'
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:38.900]   But do you really want to spend Saturday morning going and taking care of your properties?
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:42.180]   Do you really want to take time off from work on Friday morning to go meet with a banker
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:46.340]   and see if you can qualify for another mortgage just so you can have a few more million bucks
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.500]   down the road?
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:51.140]   Or would you rather just go ahead and buy a ski boat and Saturday morning load up, go
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:56.060]   down to the lake and spend the day out on the water?
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:04.060]   Do you want to be sitting in your office on Sunday afternoon reading stock reports or
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:09.340]   messing around learning how to figure out what the candles on a trading chart mean on
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.780]   Sunday afternoon?
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:17.020]   Or would you enjoy simply sitting in your den, cold drink in hand, watching a football
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.020]   game?
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:25.780]   It's a really good lifestyle."
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:29.780]   I could go on with these examples for a long time.
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:37.620]   I simply want to say that there have been many times where I have engaged in that youthful,
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:44.460]   revolutionary spirit of just waving my hands and casting off the good things that other
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:48.140]   people have.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:54.900]   Reality is if you live in a country, a wealthy country like the United States, Canada, etc.,
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:58:03.540]   living well is not that hard and the conventional formula for success is not entirely broken.
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:09.860]   Going to college will help you to have an easier entree into the job market.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:15.760]   If there is a disruption, a recession, the data from all the past recessions and disruptions
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:21.580]   has been that people with a college degree had a significantly lower unemployment rate
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:24.780]   than those without a college degree.
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:26.980]   Going to college is not a bad decision.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.700]   Getting a job is not a bad move.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.660]   Getting a job can work.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:38.060]   Investing your money in mutual funds, buying a house, buying a car, putting mortgages and
[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.660]   car payments on them and then just steadily paying them off.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:45.700]   None of these are bad things.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:54.220]   There are a lot of us who, whether it's a personality, whether it's a feature or a defect,
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.220]   I don't know.
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:59:02.100]   There are a lot of us who are just going to be happy to chart a different path.
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:09.540]   While I can appreciate so many things about a conventional lifestyle, right, the conventional
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:14.660]   financial planning path, I'm trying to articulate those things so that you know I genuinely
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:16.700]   do think they're good things.
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:21.380]   I'm unlikely to go back to it.
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:30.420]   But if you are enjoying that, don't feel like it's wrong.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:35.380]   I don't talk a lot about some of those conventional pathways just because I'm not that interested
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.740]   in them.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.980]   But if you are enjoying them, you're not wrong.
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:45.780]   Don't think that someone else is wrong.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:51.780]   I don't have buyer's remorse for the decisions that I have made.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:57.060]   All of us make, at every stage of our life, the decisions that we believe are best.
[00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:02.300]   I want to talk about that for just a moment outside of even the context of financial planning.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:08.100]   This is one thing that bothers me and I'm trying as I get older and recognize I'm seeking
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:14.100]   very diligently to do my best to be less critical of other people and to be more cautious with
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.820]   my judgments of others.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:23.140]   I think it's important that we acknowledge both intellectually and then in reality that
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:27.700]   other people are doing the best that they know how.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.220]   Our parents, they did what seemed best to them.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.220]   Our friends, they're doing their best.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.380]   Politicians, they're doing their best.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:47.380]   You can disagree with somebody without seeking to...you can disagree and honestly disagree
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:51.660]   with somebody without impugning their character.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:54.500]   Believe the best about other people.
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:59.420]   Consider others to be innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:07.460]   So when your dad gave you the advice to go to college, get a good job, and you've come
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.660]   to the point where you wish you had gone a different path, don't blame your dad for that.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.540]   Recognize he did the best.
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:20.300]   He did and said what seemed best to him.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:25.900]   When your financial advisor said, "Put money in your Roth IRA," and you wish instead of
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:32.140]   doing that, like I do, you wish that you had taken it and started a business with it, don't
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.900]   blame your financial advisor.
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:40.100]   Financial advisor gave you the best advice, right?
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:47.900]   Said the best that he knew how at the time.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:53.660]   When our city planners looked around at these narrow two-lane roads or one-lane roads and
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.660]   said, "You know what?
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:58.900]   Our life would be better if we had some bigger roads to fit our cars better," and they put
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:02.820]   in four-lane roads, they did what seemed best to them.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:08.820]   And then we've learned that, you know what, four-lane roads are really great in some applications,
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:12.860]   but in other applications they're not so great.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:24.900]   So let's be those who don't pursue radicality as some kind of pre-commitment.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:32.460]   You can indeed get great results if you are committed to a different path.
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.140]   You can get faster results.
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.780]   You can become financially independent quicker.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:48.820]   Be inspired by the radical approaches, but recognize that those radical approaches come
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.620]   with a cost often.
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:58.540]   So don't be scared to embrace the things that seem conventional.
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:06.860]   I don't intend to live as a nomad for the next, you know, 10 years of my life.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:10.580]   It's not an ideal way to live with children.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:11.580]   It's not.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.580]   I'm not sure.
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.580]   It's not great for them.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.700]   It's fine for a time.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.520]   I'm enjoying it.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:22.820]   But what I'm doing is I'm embracing where I am.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:26.580]   I'm enjoying what I'm doing.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.260]   I'm taking lots of pictures, lots of video.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:32.980]   I'm embracing the disruptions.
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:37.880]   Maybe I can't work today because I'm going to go on an excursion, or I don't get as much
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.740]   done tonight because I'm going to the beach.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.900]   I'm going to embrace where I'm at right now.
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:50.500]   But then I think my guess would be in six months or a year I'll be living in a house
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:55.660]   again and what I want to do is I want to embrace where I'm at at that time.
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:00.220]   I don't want to be longing and just saying, "I wish I was on an airplane living out of
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.380]   a suitcase again."
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:08.000]   I want to look back fondly and appreciate the living in a suitcase while appreciating
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.460]   how much easier life is in a house.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:15.380]   And then there'll come a point in time in which I'll move out of the house and I'll
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:20.800]   move back into an RV and then I'm going to appreciate the RV.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:25.460]   So similarly with a career, I'm going to appreciate when things are going well.
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:31.340]   I wish I had taken more time to appreciate previous jobs.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.340]   Who knows?
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.740]   I don't intend to take a job in the future, but maybe at some point I'll take a job.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:39.800]   When I've got that job, I'm going to appreciate everything that comes with it.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.340]   When I'm working in a business, I'm going to appreciate everything that comes with it.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:46.640]   When I'm by myself working from a house, I'm going to appreciate that.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.220]   When I'm in an office with a bunch of people on a structured schedule, I'm going to appreciate
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.500]   that.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:58.140]   My life is but a vapor and it's gone.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.460]   Life is a vapor.
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.180]   Gone.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:12.620]   Let's not be those who spend so much time wishing we were somewhere else that we don't
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:17.380]   appreciate where we are today.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:30.140]   There is power and intelligence and thoughtfulness in the things that are conventional.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:34.220]   The ancient ways of living were not stupid.
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:39.460]   The design that's gone into the modern way that we live is not stupid.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:46.740]   Don't be a revolutionary who just wants to reject everything because it's that way.
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:52.180]   Appreciate the things of the past and then systematically reform and adjust the things
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.700]   that are in your own life.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:57.020]   I'm not saying don't take radical action.
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:01.680]   I don't intend to walk away from being willing to take radical action.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:07.500]   But if you're one who listens to Joshua talk about all the things that you could do, don't
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:13.780]   feel any guilt or judgment because you honestly look at those things and say, "It's not for
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:14.780]   me.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:17.620]   I don't want to quit my job in five years.
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.820]   So although I could save 80% of my income and quit my job in five years, I don't want
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.940]   to do that.
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:26.220]   I want to save 20% of my income and quit my job in 25 years."
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:27.740]   Totally fine.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:31.820]   If you're one who says, "I recognize that I could potentially make millions if I started
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:32.820]   a business.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.540]   I don't want to start a business.
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:38.180]   I just want to put money in my 401k and I want to live a good life now."
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:42.420]   That's totally fine.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:48.380]   I'm going to continue to bring you as much clear-headed radical thinking and as many
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:51.100]   radical ideas as I'm capable of.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:56.780]   I'm going to continue to test as many things as I possibly can to be the human guinea pig
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:01.100]   who does wacky weird things to try them out and see how they work.
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:08.380]   I'm going to continue to tell you honestly that the things that sound awesome often have
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:16.820]   a lot of awesomeness associated with them, but there is also a lot of difficulty that's
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.540]   usually associated with them.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:24.740]   I want to do my best to articulate the awesomeness and the difficulties so that you can have
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:28.220]   a more balanced perspective.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:33.620]   I'm not changing the name of Radical Personal Finance to Conventional Personal Finance,
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:44.340]   but I'm going to try to continue to highlight the wisdom of conventionality for you and
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.340]   for me.
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.700]   Get in zone, AutoZone.

[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.780]   I got to change the oil in my car.
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:57.740]   Right now, get five quarts of Pennzoil Platinum Full Synthetic with an STP Extended Life Oil
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:01.300]   Filter for only $36.99.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.020]   What do I do with my old oil?
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:06.340]   We can recycle your used oil for free.
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.340]   And do you have oil for my old work truck?
