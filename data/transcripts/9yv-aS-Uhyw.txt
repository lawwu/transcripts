[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   We're back with Dr. Albert Moeller, the president of the Southern Baptist Theological
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.640]   Seminary in Louisville and the author of the book, The Conviction to Lead, 25 Principles
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.440]   for Leadership that Matters.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.360]   Dr. Moeller, in the book you wrote this, "In the secular world, leaders worry about the
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.800]   judgment of stockholders and stakeholders.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.680]   Politicians worry about the verdict of history.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.000]   As Christian leaders, we know that we will face nothing less than a divine judgment on
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   our leadership."
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.800]   Those are strong words.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800]   Explain this.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.400]   How important is the final judgment in the life of Christian leadership?
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.040]   Well, it goes back to what we were talking about in terms of why what we do here in this
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.640]   life is important.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.800]   It's not important because it's the end of all things.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.120]   If it were the end of all things, we'd be in trouble because we would have to find all
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.220]   life and meaning and rescue and redemption and salvation in this life, and it's not here.
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.040]   This life is important, and so what we do in this life has a dignity to it and a purpose
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.400]   to it that explains why, for instance, the career we have, the profession that we've
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.040]   been called to, the particular responsibility given to us is important, and the vision of
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.040]   where these things are going is that, for instance, the secular world, he says, we're
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.720]   doing this in order to get to the next quarterly report, to the next annual review, perhaps
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.080]   to the next 10-year plan.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.140]   The Christian does not have no concern at all for those things, but the Christian understands
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.320]   that we are citizens of a heavenly kingdom.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.760]   Our most important existence is not in this life.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.920]   We're not going to try to get all our joys in this life.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.780]   Satisfaction is found only in Christ, and that will be given to us only as Christ brings
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.500]   His kingdom in fullness, but in the meantime, we can do great good, and we're called to
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.300]   do great good, and we can change lives.
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.380]   We can influence many, and what a great and glorious thing that God has given us this
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.380]   opportunity.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.380]   Yeah, amen.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.380]   That is glorious.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.700]   And to influence many, leaders must use authority and power.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.540]   Authority and power, of course, are loaded terms today, and really anyone with authority
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.060]   or power is held in immediate suspicion.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.720]   How does a leader lead, knowing that the folks he may be leading are suspicious of him merely
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.660]   because he's leading?
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.740]   Well, we live in an anti-authoritarian age to only a very limited extent.
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.380]   It is interesting that you have Theodore Adorno and others who back especially after the Second
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.160]   World War said, "We have to get rid of all authority.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.460]   Authority itself is bad because it's always misused."
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.140]   And the problem is we can't live without it.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.620]   God has made us also to desperately need structure, to need authority.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.580]   That's true in the church, and it's also true in the society at large.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.140]   Romans 13 tells us that God himself has put governing authorities in power because there
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.340]   is something worse than a tyrant, and that's anarchy.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.020]   And it turns out that human beings actually long for that kind of authoritative leadership.
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.100]   Now, that doesn't mean that it's the wrong and abusive understanding of authority, and
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.540]   that's where Christians also have to understand that our stewardship is always on behalf of
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.860]   another.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.420]   And so any authority we have is a delegated authority, and we have it always as long as
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.260]   we have it, and we have the stewardship of it so long as we have it.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.620]   And so it's kind of like fatherhood, Tony.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.060]   The last thing we need are fathers who don't father.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.460]   And certainly there are horrible models of authoritarian fathers who didn't love their
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.700]   children, were abusive to their children, and we recoil in horror at that.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.300]   But the last thing we need then, on the other hand, are fathers who sit around looking at
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.740]   four-year-olds and saying, "Okay, what would you have us to do today?
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.700]   What would you have to be our goal in life?
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.060]   How would you discipline yourself?"
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.900]   It just doesn't work, and we know it.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.500]   And so everywhere you find a great leader, you find the exercise of authority, but we're
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.900]   all judged on that exercise of authority.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.780]   And of course, the most important authority is that of influence.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.140]   If it comes down to the fact, just like if the father is always having to say, "You do
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.380]   this because I said so," we've got a problem.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.300]   Now, the child should do it because the father says so, but more than that, the child should
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.940]   want to do it because the father has influenced the child so that the child has intuitions
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.420]   and inclinations to eagerly do what the father suggests.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.740]   And so I think when we look at words like "authority" and it gets tied to "leadership,"
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.380]   we have to understand that honesty compels us to say there is no leadership without some
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.900]   form of authority.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.460]   Because by the way, when you have people talk about authority, they're often thinking merely
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.380]   about positional authority, but there's the authority of influence, there's the authority
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.840]   of charisma, there's the authority of personality, and there's the authority of opportunity.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.340]   So we just have to be honest and say, "Wherever you find a leader, there's some kind of authority.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.820]   The question is whether it's being exercised faithfully or not."
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.820]   Yeah, amen.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.980]   The title of your book is "The Conviction to Lead."
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.980]   Leaders have conviction, and that means they need some level of self-confidence, for lack
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.180]   of a better word.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.020]   Where do we draw the balance between bold confidence or self-confidence and a humble
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.700]   correctability on the other hand?
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.860]   Another great question, but I think it's implied in the title of the book, "The Conviction
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.860]   to Lead."
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:23.140]   I am doing my very best to redefine leadership in terms of conviction that is shared with
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.700]   others and then leads to right corporate action.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.580]   And the fact is that if the Christian leader understands that the conviction to lead means
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.380]   to lead with conviction, then we understand that this is not being done in our own name.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.420]   This is not self-confidence because we're so confident in ourselves.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.580]   We're absolutely confident in truth.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.580]   We're absolutely confident.
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.500]   One of the things I point out is that convictions aren't merely the things you believe.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.420]   They're the beliefs that possess you, that define your life.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.020]   And if you lead that way, you're going to understand that our first confidence is in
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.020]   truth.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.260]   That means for the Christian, our first confidence is in the God of all truth, the God who revealed
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.620]   truth and in Jesus Christ, the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.540]   And thus, our confidence is in the fact we really do know the one true and living God.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.740]   And we really do know the purpose of life.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.540]   And we really do know what it means to find salvation in Christ and then to follow him
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.540]   as his disciple.
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.460]   We really do know right from wrong.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.260]   We really do know a value system that the world does not understand.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.020]   And based on those convictions, we do have a certain amount of self-confidence.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.340]   The last thing you need is a leader that gets up there and isn't sure.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.260]   But again, the issue is we should be sure of the convictions.
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.580]   That should produce the confidence.
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.540]   That was Dr. Albert Moeller by phone from his office.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.040]   He serves as the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and he is the
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.020]   author of the book, "The Conviction to Lead, 25 Principles for Leadership that Matters."
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.900]   Moeller is a master of media, print, digital, social media, video, and audio, you name it.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.660]   And tomorrow I'll ask him about the role of reading, writing, and blogging in leadership.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.820]   I'm your host Tony Ranke, and I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:09.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
