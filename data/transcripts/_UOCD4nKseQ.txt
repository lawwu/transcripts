[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.440]   - You worked and were friends with Richard Feynman.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.260]   How has he influenced you,
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.220]   changed you as a physicist and thinker?
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.960]   - What I saw, I think what I saw
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.860]   was somebody who could do physics
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.680]   in this deeply intuitive way.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.160]   His style was almost to close his eyes
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.640]   and visualize the phenomena that he was thinking about.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.960]   And through visualization,
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.680]   outflank the mathematical,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.480]   the highly mathematical and very, very sophisticated
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.160]   technical arguments that people would use.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.520]   I think that was also natural to me,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.080]   but I saw somebody who was actually successful at it,
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.800]   who could do physics in a way that I regarded as
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.600]   simpler, more direct, more intuitive.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.160]   And while I don't think he changed my way of thinking,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.560]   I do think he validated it.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.760]   He made me look at it and say,
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.360]   "Yeah, that's something you can do and get away with."
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.760]   Practically, you can get away with it.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.320]   - So do you find yourself,
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.240]   whether you're thinking about quantum mechanics
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.040]   or black holes or string theory,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.480]   using intuition as a first step
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.240]   or a step throughout using visualization?
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.760]   - Yeah, very much so, very much so.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.800]   I tend not to think about the equations.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.240]   I tend not to think about the symbols.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.740]   I tend to try to visualize the phenomena themselves.
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.480]   And then when I get an insight that I think is valid,
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.440]   I might try to convert it to mathematics.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.480]   But I'm not a natural mathematician.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.320]   I'm good enough at it.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.880]   I'm good enough at it, but I'm not a great mathematician.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.480]   So for me, the way of thinking about physics
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.720]   is first intuitive, first visualization,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.720]   scribble a few equations maybe,
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.040]   but then try to convert it to mathematics.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.840]   Experience says that other people are better
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.940]   at converting it to mathematics than I am.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.560]   - And yet you've worked with very counterintuitive ideas.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.880]   So how do you-- - No, that's true.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.720]   That's true. - So how do you
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.760]   visualize something counterintuitive?
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.120]   How do you dare? - By rewiring your brain
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.080]   in new ways. - Huh.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.840]   - Yeah, quantum mechanics is not intuitive.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.900]   Very little of modern physics is intuitive.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.640]   Intuitive, what does intuitive mean?
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.960]   It means the ability to think about it
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.880]   with basic classical physics,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   the physics that we evolved with throwing stones,
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.520]   splashing water, whatever it happens to be.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.240]   Quantum physics, general relativity,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.320]   quantum field theory are deeply unintuitive in that way.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.360]   But after time and getting familiar with these things,
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.200]   you develop new intuitions.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.700]   I always said you rewire.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.520]   And it's to the point where me and many of my friends,
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.860]   I and many of my friends,
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.400]   can think more easily quantum mechanically
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.640]   than we can classically.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.600]   We've gotten so used to it.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.360]   - I mean, yes, our neural wiring in our brain
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.520]   is such that we understand rocks and stones and water
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.120]   and so on. - We sort of evolved for that.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.420]   - Evolved for it. - Yeah.
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.840]   - Do you think it's possible to create a wiring
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.280]   of neuron-like state devices that more naturally
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.000]   understand quantum mechanics, understand wave function,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.220]   understand these weird things?
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.160]   - Well, I'm not sure.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.640]   I think many of us have evolved the ability
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.500]   to think quantum mechanically to some extent.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.200]   But that doesn't mean you can think like an electron.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.720]   That doesn't mean, another example,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.000]   forget for a minute quantum mechanics,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.800]   just visualizing four-dimensional space
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.200]   or five-dimensional space or six-dimensional space,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.920]   I think we're fundamentally wired
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.340]   to visualize three dimensions.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.040]   I can't even visualize two dimensions or one dimension
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.120]   without thinking about it as embedded in three dimensions.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.360]   If I want to visualize a line,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.920]   I think of the line as being a line in three dimensions.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.660]   Or I think of the line as being a line on a piece of paper
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.240]   with a piece of paper being in three dimensions.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   I never seem to be able to, in some abstract and pure way,
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.800]   visualize in my head the one dimension, the two dimension,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.880]   the four dimension, the five dimensions,
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.440]   and I don't think that's ever gonna happen.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.640]   The reason is, I think, our neural wiring
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.980]   is just set up for that.
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.280]   On the other hand, we do learn ways to think about
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.640]   five, six, seven dimensions.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.260]   We learn ways, we learn mathematical ways,
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.680]   and we learn ways to visualize them, but they're different.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.840]   And so, yeah, I think we do rewire ourselves.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.280]   Whether we can ever completely rewire ourselves
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.740]   to be completely comfortable with these concepts, I doubt.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.600]   - So that it's completely natural.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.160]   - To the tour, it's completely natural.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.240]   - So I'm sure there's somewhat, you could argue,
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.480]   creatures that live in a two-dimensional space.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.680]   - Yeah, maybe there are.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.280]   - And while it's romanticizing the notion,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.100]   of course, we're all living, as far as we know,
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.720]   in three-dimensional space,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.640]   but how do those creatures imagine 3D space?
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.640]   - Well, probably the way we imagine 4D,
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.520]   by using some mathematics and some equations
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.100]   and some tricks.
