[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   As I understand Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disorder, impacts the hippocampus, among other
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760]   structures.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.560]   There's been some debate in recent years as to whether or not the whole amyloid hypothesis
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.720]   is real or not.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.960]   There's a bunch of unfortunately false data accusations and that whole thing.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.940]   But my understanding is that if you look at a slice of human brain from a patient that
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.200]   died with Alzheimer's, maybe even from Alzheimer's, that you see plaques and tangles.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.360]   You see these sub-cellular structures and buildup and that our basic understanding of
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.320]   Alzheimer's that's in the textbook and that most people have heard of is still correct,
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320]   right?
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.320]   Yes.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.320]   Okay.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.280]   Because I think a couple of years ago it was, you know, unfortunately the way social media
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.640]   sometimes can work is that, you know, the idea was that it was all wrong, you know,
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.640]   all wrong.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.100]   And somebody fudged data, they made up data and that's terrible.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.160]   But Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disorder, includes the hippocampus, plaques and tangles
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.800]   are present in the neurons.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.320]   Those are not good for neurons as I understand.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.080]   So what's the controversy like and why don't we have a treatment for Alzheimer's yet?
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.080]   I feel like almost every other psychiatric disease, including Parkinson's, like there
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.480]   are certain things you can do to at least push the system in the right way.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.360]   Why is Alzheimer's and other dementias so tricky?
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.920]   Yeah, I mean it's very frustrating because the neurodegenerative disorders, it's so many
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.120]   factors that are probably involved in the pathology that there's not, you know, one
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.240]   single transmitter.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.320]   The Parkinson's disease, it's a decreased dopamine and so one transmitter can make a
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.680]   very big difference.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.520]   Early on in Alzheimer's it was discovered that there was low acetylcholine in the brains
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.600]   and the only approved treatment for Alzheimer's disease is a drug that boosts acetylcholine.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   What's the drug?
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   It's called Donepezil.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.560]   There's a few of them, they're anticholinesterase inhibitors that boost acetylcholine.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.840]   They've been around for 20 years or more and, you know, the reality is when you give it
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.720]   to your patients they don't see much of a difference because it's not the primary deficit.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.720]   So the real problem has been trying to find out what is the primary mechanism that's leading
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.640]   to this wide range of cognitive behavioral issues and there doesn't seem to be at least
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.560]   one neurotransmitter that can make the difference and so now the push has been is there one,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.560]   is there something else that we can do?
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   Can we block amyloid?
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.080]   Can we block something in the pathology and again it just has not been successful.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.920]   It's very frustrating because I think it was over probably 35 years ago I saw my first
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.560]   Alzheimer's patients and I don't believe I say that much different to them now, you know,
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.320]   except that we have a lot more things we can do just on the social side of things.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.400]   But unfortunately for drugs we don't have anything that's been really transformative.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.060]   But again that's I think part of being a neurologist it sounds very depressing but I think part
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.960]   of what the family isn't always looking for a cure, of course that's they'd like to have
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.840]   a cure but I think them understanding what's going on, what to expect, how to handle the
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.520]   behaviors is what they're really after at least until we find, you know, a cure.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.640]   Parkinson's, you mentioned, is a deficit in dopaminergic function due largely to degeneration
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.880]   of dopaminergic neurons.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.160]   There there's some effective treatments, right?
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   L-Dopa.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.280]   Did you know there's this over-the-counter stuff that's sold that a lot of people take
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.360]   who don't have Parkinson's?
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.200]   I'm not suggesting they take it called mucuna prurines, it's the velvety bean.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   Yeah, I've heard of it.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   It's 99% L-Dopa.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.360]   I've heard of it, yeah.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.800]   It's in present in like some energy drinks and supplements and people can go buy it.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.240]   I'm not suggesting they do that.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:58.800]   I actually tried it, boy, I feel being really dopamined out does not, to me doesn't feel
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.800]   that good.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.320]   Yeah, I felt kind of agitated, my vision got a little, you know, twinkly, it did not feel
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.680]   like a high of any kind and then I felt lousy for a couple hours after it wore off.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.560]   Yeah, I don't think you can really get in enough L-Dopa to get enough into your brain.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.840]   That happened early in neurology when it was discovered we couldn't give our patients enough
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.520]   L-Dopa without them feeling bad because it's also metabolized in the periphery.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.960]   And so it wasn't until we, Sinemet came along, which has this decarboxylase inhibitor that
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.960]   blocks sort of the breakdown of dopamine that we were able to sort of get enough dopamine
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   into the brain.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.320]   So I'm not sure, yeah, so that's why I think it's not going to probably get the levels
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.940]   up high enough in the brain.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.440]   So Parkinson's patients are given L-Dopa or bromocriptine or drugs like that.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.000]   Going back to Alzheimer's for a moment, I mean, what do you tell somebody who has early
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   stage Alzheimer's?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.080]   You just say, listen, try and get good sleep, try and keep people around you, stay cognitively
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.720]   engaged, try and keep those circuits going through behavioral induced neuroplasticity.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.240]   But we're just going to watch the steepness of the decline.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.360]   Is that really all we've got?
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.000]   - All we've got is to help them with everything that comes up on a day-to-day basis.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.020]   A lot of the problems, the memory problems tend to be something that families can help
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.080]   compensate for, but you do get to a point where you can't be with someone for 24/7.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.280]   It's a real burnout for caregivers.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.880]   A lot of the behaviors that come up, patients get kind of delusions and agitated, and some
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.160]   of the medications that we use for other conditions are helpful for treating that.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.960]   But it's really just a purely symptomatic therapy.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.040]   And the more socialization that patients get, they tend to do better.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.560]   There was a study back at Penn, way back, that if you showed patients some family movies
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.880]   or family albums, it was better than any drug you could give them to sort of help their
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.880]   behavior.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.600]   So there's still those memories that are in there, and they were making some type of contact
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.040]   that was helping them emotionally that you couldn't turn off with a drug.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.520]   So I think the more we do things like that, the more we'll be helpful for them, at least
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   symptomatically.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.160]   - I've seen a number of videos on social media of people with Alzheimer's who listen to a
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.560]   piece of music, or people with Parkinson's that hear a piece of music, and that seems
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.440]   to resurrect some at least context-appropriate emotional state, where it kind of brings the
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.360]   person to the surface again.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.560]   Yeah, it's kind of a tragic situation for Alzheimer's right now.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.720]   It seems like if ever there was a call to arms for the neurology community and biotech
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:59.160]   and behavioral tech, it would be for Alzheimer's, for the treatment of Alzheimer's.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:06.040]   I will never ask a guest to comment on the good or bad behaviors of other people, except
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.320]   my own.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:15.200]   But there's a Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist, and I visited him, he's at a Big East Coast
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.600]   school back in 2010, and during the course of our one-hour meeting, he consumed no fewer
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.920]   than four pieces of Nicorette gum.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.640]   And I said, "I got to ask, what's this about?"
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.120]   By the way, he's extremely sharp still.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.200]   And he said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, I used to be a smoker, but smoking is really
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.560]   bad for you because you can get lung cancer, dipping is bad for you because you can get
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.480]   mouth cancer, but nicotine," these are his words, by the way, "is protective against
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.800]   Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, and it keeps my brain sharp, so I chew Nicorette all day
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   long."
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   And I thought, "Okay, well, he's not, he is an MD, actually."
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.680]   And I thought, "Oh, that's interesting."
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.640]   And I did an episode of this podcast on nicotine.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.840]   It, by the way, can raise blood pressure.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.680]   It's certainly smoking, vaping, dipping, or snuffing, not good, bad, don't do it.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.720]   But there is some interest in the use of nicotine as a cognitive enhancer.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.960]   So I'd love to know your thoughts on that.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.060]   And I'd love to know your thoughts on his statement about nicotine being a potential
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.280]   way to stave off Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, with the caveat that he just kind of threw
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.480]   that out there, and this guy's sort of known for just kind of throwing stuff out there
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   every once in a while.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.960]   I have a feeling you know who this person is, but in any event, what gives?
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:40.840]   Yeah, well, I don't know anything about nicotine staving off any neurodegenerative disorder,
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:46.000]   but nicotine was used, and it was used in a number of early Alzheimer's studies just
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   because of its effect on the cholinergic system.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.640]   So there is some truth to that.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.560]   The cholinergic system is dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease, and boosting the cholinergic
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.880]   system probably is beneficial.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.200]   I mean, the patients that we give the anticholinesterase inhibitors, there are some families that
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.160]   say, "Yeah, he's remembering more, and he's just doing better."
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.860]   So I've seen positive things to it.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.240]   It doesn't really slow the course of the disease.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240]   That's the problem.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.400]   The disease just carries on, even though we're symptomatically improving the symptoms.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.920]   But again, I think it's going to take both acetylcholine and something else.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.080]   I think we don't know, should we give dopamine with the nicotine or the acetylcholine?
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   Should we give norepinephrine?
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.640]   I think it's going to be a cocktail, which, again, pharmaceutical companies have not tried
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.320]   a cocktail of neuromodulators for Alzheimer's disease.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.480]   They've just tried acetylcholine.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:46.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
