[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   Today we have an important missions question from a listener named Zach.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.680]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.040]   A friend and I have been reading your book, Let the Nations Be Glad.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.480]   It has been a blessing to both of us as we each pursue our roles in missions.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.960]   So thank you for that book.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.880]   I've been wondering if Christians will have to reach every unreached people group or at
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.320]   least every unengaged unreached people group before Jesus returns.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.680]   It seems to me that the disciples lived as though they believed Jesus would return any
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.680]   day, and the Bible certainly speaks of Jesus coming at any moment.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.840]   Also looking at Revelation 14, 6, I wonder if that passage is saying that if Jesus returns
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.080]   before we as Christians have accomplished the task to reach all the unreached, the angel
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.840]   will take care of the rest, so to speak.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.040]   Pastor John, what do you think?
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.840]   Let me preface what I'm going to say with the statement that I am so willing to be corrected
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.840]   on this.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.600]   And I'll say more about that maybe as we go along, so please don't hear me having the
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.480]   level of forcefulness in this as I might with other teachings that I find to be clearer.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.620]   But I do have convictions, and I'll tell you what they are.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.920]   The way I would express my understanding of the Bible is that Jesus clearly commanded
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.800]   us to make disciples of all the peoples, tribes, languages of the world.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:33.080]   Matthew 28, 19, Revelation 5, 9, he gave us his Holy Spirit and power to that end, Acts
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.080]   1, 8.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.920]   He promised to be with us to the end of the age for that purpose, Matthew 28, 20, and
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.120]   he said that the end would come, that is, he would come when this task of witnessing
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.000]   to all the nations is complete.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.400]   Yes, I did say that in the book.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   I'm saying it now.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:03.400]   I don't want to claim that I can define precisely the work of world evangelization so down to
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.560]   the detail that I will know the day and the hour when it is complete.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.600]   I'm not even close.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.040]   So there is significant ambiguity.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.920]   Hear me, there's significant ambiguity.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.960]   It may sound like, "Oh, when the nations are reached, he's coming."
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.560]   Well, the nations being reached is not defined in the Bible with any clarity.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.520]   So there's ambiguity in saying the end will come when the work is complete, though I'm
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.560]   saying that.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.720]   One of the main passages in the Bible for believing this is Matthew 24, 14, "This gospel
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.760]   of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.560]   and then the end will come."
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.200]   So the main sentence in Zach's question that I need to respond to is this.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.320]   He says, "It seems to me that the disciples lived as though they believed Jesus would
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.800]   return at any day, and the Bible certainly speaks," he says, "of Jesus coming at any
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   moment."
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.680]   Now, I disagree with both of those statements.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.680]   It's as widely accepted as they are.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.800]   I think the apostles and Jesus both taught and lived as though they expected a significant
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.520]   delay in Jesus coming, not as though he might come at any moment, and I don't think the
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.200]   Bible speaks clearly of Jesus coming at any moment.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.500]   Now, whole books have been written to argue both sides of this issue, and I've got less
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.440]   than 10 minutes now.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:56.960]   Let it be said loud and clear that disagreements about the timing of the coming of the Lord—and
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.360]   may it be so—not the fact of it, but the timing of it, are not the kind of disagreements
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.240]   that separate me from fellowship with other Christians.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.360]   So let me just give a few biblical pointers—I'm going to call it that, pointers—for why
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.080]   I think the way I do.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:27.840]   Jesus said in Matthew 24, 5 through 8, about the time after he would leave the earth, this,
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.760]   "Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.200]   astray.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.960]   See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.600]   For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.280]   and earthquakes in various places.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.960]   All these are but the beginning of the birth pains."
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.560]   Now, that simply does not sound like Jesus is saying, "As soon as I leave, I could
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.200]   come back at any minute," because he's got all this happening before he comes.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:24.760]   In fact, it seems to me that Jesus went out of his way to discourage people in his day
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.640]   from thinking that the end would come immediately, or any minute after he left.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:37.080]   For example, in Luke 19, 11, and 12, it says, "As they heard these things, he proceeded
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:45.360]   to tell a parable," because he was near Jerusalem and because they supposed that the
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.480]   kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.800]   So he's correcting a timing issue.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:06:00.980]   And then he says this, "He said, therefore, 'A nobleman went into a far country to receive
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.080]   for himself a kingdom and then return.'"
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.040]   So what's the point of that?
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:15.880]   The point is, Jesus' departure, his going to heaven, is like a nobleman going to a far
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.440]   country and then return.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.520]   And he tells it to keep them from thinking it would be immediate.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:30.200]   And he said, "Far country," precisely to discourage them from thinking that he'd come right away.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.800]   Or let's take Paul, for example.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:38.160]   When Paul faced a similar misunderstanding in Thessalonica about how soon the second
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.200]   coming would happen, here's how he responded.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.720]   Second Thessalonians 2, verse 1, following.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.600]   "Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:57.840]   him, that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the man of lawlessness is
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   revealed.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:06.560]   And you know what is restraining him now, so that he may be revealed in his time.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.560]   The lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.600]   and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming."
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:22.760]   I don't see how Paul could say that and expect the Thessalonians to believe that Jesus could
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.840]   come that afternoon.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.600]   He's telling them things that are not yet in place, this man of lawlessness, before
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.560]   the Lord will come.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.180]   So what do I make?
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:43.920]   What do I make of Jesus' words when he says, for example, in Matthew 25, 13, "Watch, therefore,
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.320]   for you know neither the day nor the hour."
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:54.260]   Or Luke 12, 40, "You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.320]   You do not expect."
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:04.640]   Now I take these statements to mean that every believer in every generation should be spiritually
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:14.240]   vigilant, watchful, never allowing themselves to become drunk with worldliness and indifference
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.600]   to the Lord's coming.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:25.100]   Because it is possible that in any generation that people may become so besotted, a person
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:32.660]   may become so besotted spiritually that they are utterly oblivious to how suddenly things
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.380]   may develop to issue in the second coming.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:43.220]   Here's the way Jesus says it in Luke 12, 45, "If that servant says to himself, 'My
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:50.260]   master is delayed in coming,' and he begins to beat the male and female servants and to
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:57.140]   eat and drink and get drunk, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:02.260]   not expect him, and at an hour he does not know."
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:09.580]   In other words, the people who will be taken off guard and ruined at the coming of the
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.080]   Lord are those who cease to be vigilant.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.580]   So always stay awake spiritually, be vigilant, be ready, be alert, be doing your Lord's
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.580]   business so that He can find you so occupied when He comes.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.020]   Now when the New Testament says things like, "The coming of the Lord is at hand," or
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:35.900]   "Behold, the judge is standing at the gates," James 5, 8, and 9, both of those statements
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:43.340]   come from James 5, the point is not that He will open the gates immediately, but that
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:51.060]   we better not presume upon His delay as though we could do what we jolly will.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.540]   Please, we don't control His coming.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.700]   He is at the gates.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.700]   He can open them when He pleases.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.660]   He controls the timing.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:05.860]   So I think the most crucial word for us maybe to all agree on here, whatever eschatology
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.060]   you have, and I've got some really good friends who disagree with me on this.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:16.580]   My father didn't see things the way I'm describing them right now, and I love my father to death,
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.420]   and I think he's in heaven now and cheering me on.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.420]   I don't know if he agrees with me now or not.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.300]   I hope he does.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.300]   So the most important thing we agreed on, and all of us who love Christ, love His mission,
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.500]   love the cross, love the gospel, love His second coming, can agree on is Acts 1, 8.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.860]   It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed with His own authority.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.860]   You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.420]   in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:56.060]   So let's seek that power now, and let's finish that mission.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.340]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for the question, Zach, and wherever you're listening

[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.420]   Well next time, an important question from a man who has been freed from the bondage
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.880]   of pornography.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.440]   Now he faces the question of how to battle lust and temptations subtler than porn.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.220]   This is a question we get from men about things like swimsuit issues and lingerie catalogs
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.360]   that show up in their mailboxes.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   That is up next time.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.480]   On the other side of the weekend, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
