[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.780]   - Happy Labor Day everyone.
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.600]   I know many of you had the day off,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.800]   but it's not a day off for the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.840]   And today is a good day to reflect on the luxuries
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.240]   that surround our lives.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240]   We have a question from Rick Siegel,
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.500]   who serves as the Vice President of Advancement
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.280]   and Distinguished Lecturer of Commerce and Vocation
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.600]   at Bethlehem College and Seminary.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.760]   Rick writes in to ask this, Pastor John,
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.740]   how are we to think of luxuries?
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.280]   For example, people were once required to buy ice
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.440]   from an ice man to chill and preserve their food.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.680]   Eventually a fellow invented an electric refrigerator,
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.280]   but at its original price point,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.120]   only the very wealthy could own this luxurious
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.800]   then non-essential product.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.720]   But as more wealthy people bought a refrigerator,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.800]   a greater demand enabled greater supply,
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.480]   driving down the cost of manufacture
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.200]   and making the product more widely available.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.380]   Today, a refrigerator would be considered
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.440]   one of life's essentials,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.040]   even for those who have adopted a wartime lifestyle.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.780]   So are luxury purchases made by those with means to do so
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.020]   to be frowned upon even when the products meet a need
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.960]   that only someone with such sufficient means can afford?
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.420]   What do you say, Pastor John?
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.180]   - Well, what I say is yes, a luxury,
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.820]   the term luxury is relative, isn't it?
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.540]   It's relative to time and it's relative to culture.
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.140]   Clearly it is.
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.820]   So what I look for is a possible definition for me
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.820]   that works, that helps me to discern
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.820]   what would a sinful luxury be so that I could avoid it.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.860]   And here's my best shot to guide John Piper
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.860]   in what to avoid as a sinful luxury.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.660]   That would be a non-essential that one shouldn't buy,
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.980]   which raises the question,
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.540]   well, how do you decide what you should buy
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.940]   if some non-essentials are okay to buy?
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.580]   And here are the questions that I ask myself.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.220]   I've got about four or five of them
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.460]   and I'm sure there are more,
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.420]   but these are the ones that I use
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.980]   as I try to think through.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.980]   Number one, is it good for my soul or for your soul
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.700]   and the souls of the people around you?
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.660]   And I'm thinking here of beauty
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.360]   and various kinds of say artwork
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.220]   that you would hang on your walls
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.340]   that you could live without,
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.740]   but you hang a picture up
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.500]   or flowers that you plant in your garden.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.700]   We are more than biological, physical people.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.100]   We're created in God's image.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.900]   We're made to see and know and love beauty.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.760]   And it's possible to surround yourself with beauty
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.580]   without being rich,
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.620]   but it is in one sense a non-essential.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.180]   And in that sense, you could live without it.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.320]   That would be a kind of survival.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.320]   So is it good for the soul of your family and yourself?
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.220]   Number two, is it good for efficiency in life ministry?
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.520]   So freezer, car, computer,
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.000]   you could spend most of your time walking
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.020]   or riding your bike or typing on a typewriter
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.740]   or making more trips to the store
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.100]   if you don't have a freezer or a refrigerator,
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.860]   but you may conclude efficiency
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.740]   for the sake of using your time more productively is wiser.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.260]   And therefore those purchases are warranted
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.140]   for that kind of reason.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.100]   Third question, is it affordable
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   without saying to the world that you love things
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.180]   and are into the pride of possessions?
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.320]   That's a phrase from 1 John.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.320]   So what's gonna be the impact to the world
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.720]   as they watch you buy something?
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.340]   So I listened to a news thing the other day
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.620]   where a manuscript of Bob Dylan's song,
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.580]   I forget which song it was,
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.500]   "The Times They Are a-Changin'" maybe,
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.220]   sold for $1.2 million.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.780]   - Wow.
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.260]   - One little piece of paper.
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.420]   (laughs)
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.260]   And I thought, I don't think I would buy that
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.460]   even if I could afford
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.080]   because it just would say the wrong thing
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.660]   about where my, I think where my priorities are.
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.140]   So what you say to the world
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.060]   by what you do with your money,
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.540]   I think is also a significant factor.
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.940]   And here's a fourth one.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.940]   Is it affordable without replacing or hindering good deeds?
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.340]   This is a tough one, but I think it's relevant.
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.520]   In other words, is the money you just spent
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.900]   on this non-essential hindering you
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.720]   from a lifestyle of an act of love?
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.740]   And you could always say,
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.500]   well, I could have given that money to the missionary,
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.620]   and that's true.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.380]   Every ice cream cone you buy,
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.400]   you could have sent to somewhere else.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.020]   But I'm thinking of, would you have?
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.100]   Has it gotten in the way of heartfelt calling
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.260]   to do a good thing,
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.620]   but I'm not gonna do that good thing.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.380]   I'm gonna bless me and not them.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.620]   Then you wouldn't wanna do that.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.980]   And the last question would be,
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.980]   is it an occasional, expensive, non-essential
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.100]   that would say an extraordinary, I love you?
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.380]   'Cause I'm talking about something pretty expensive here.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.780]   Is it good for making special celebrations?
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.320]   Now, I'm not thinking of very expensive.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.500]   So the first one would be like an engagement ring.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.200]   We talked about that once before.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.140]   You don't have to buy the most expensive or the biggest.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.420]   It doesn't even have to be a diamond,
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.900]   but it will be more expensive than your usual purchase
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.820]   because there's a big, glorious, beautiful,
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.580]   I think God-ordained, I love you to be said here,
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.300]   and I'm committed to you, and I want you
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.300]   that our culture recognizes as a beautiful and sweet thing.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.260]   In the other category, marking special celebrations,
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.300]   I'm thinking of a Butterfinger Blizzard
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.580]   for John Piper on his birthday at Dairy Queen
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.500]   because I don't eat these but once a year.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.380]   And so I pay for the biggest one
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.260]   or somebody who is buying for me
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.740]   pays for the biggest one,
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.740]   and I love every bite to the glory of God, I hope.
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.380]   Or one other example, we got home from Tennessee
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.260]   a few weeks ago in Minneapolis.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.180]   The house was totally empty, boxes everywhere.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.380]   I had to go out and get some milk
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.580]   'cause we didn't have anything for breakfast
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.320]   the next morning, and I was at CUB,
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.020]   and as I was walking to the counter,
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.780]   there was this display of flower bouquets,
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.940]   and one of them was orange daisies.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.660]   Well, now, my wife loves daisies
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.380]   for reasons we won't go into,
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.760]   and oranges tell us his favorite color,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.760]   and I said, "Perfect, a welcome home bouquet."
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.700]   I think it cost $6.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.780]   Now, I didn't need that.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.820]   They would not have missed it, but I took it home.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.980]   I handed it to Noelle.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.580]   I said, "Welcome home.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.160]   "It's good to be home."
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.580]   So that, I think, fits into the occasion
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.180]   of is there something precious?
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.580]   Is life big and beautiful,
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.420]   and you're not getting rich in doing this.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.340]   You're not living off luxuries in doing this,
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.820]   but you know it's nonessential.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.780]   So those are some of the questions that I would ask
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.980]   in trying to decide if something is a sinful luxury or not.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.200]   - That's very good.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.220]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.020]   And this brings up two related questions.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.060]   First, about hobbies.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.660]   What do we do with hobbies, especially expensive ones?
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.060]   That was the center of episode number 270.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.140]   You can find that in the archive, episode number 270.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.940]   But this episode also raises a question about wealth.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.060]   Should wealthy Christians hold on to wealth
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.340]   as a way of generating future income,
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.580]   or should they simply give the excess wealth
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.740]   away to charity?
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.660]   That's a follow-up question we will address tomorrow
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.140]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.060]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.100]   Thanks for listening.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:41.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
