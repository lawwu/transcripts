[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   There are so many different credit cards that can help you maximize your rewards
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.120]   across dozens of spending categories.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.440]   But what if a single card could not only simplify your wallet,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.400]   but also maximize your earnings?
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.800]   Today, I'm diving into the best single cash back cards
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.200]   that go way beyond earning just 2%.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.760]   There's so many new options, including cards that earn up to 4% back
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.080]   on all your spending.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.880]   So I'll break down the top contenders, their pros and cons
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.800]   and how to choose the right one for you.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800]   And then I'll throw a little bit of a wrench in it all
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.360]   and tell you about an even better way to be earning 13% or more back
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.760]   on all your spending.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.600]   I'm Chris Hutchins.

[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.760]   OK, first, I want to talk about the best cash back cards
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.520]   because a lot of things have changed.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.040]   In episode 170, I had an episode called cash back versus points,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.400]   and I made a case for cash back then.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.240]   But this felt like it needed an update
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.040]   since there's been a lot of changes, most specifically
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.680]   the U.S. Bank Smartly card, which has really forced a lot of people,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.480]   myself included, to decide how much we really value our points.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.600]   Today, I want to talk about the best single cash back card
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.840]   we can have in our wallets.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.400]   And by that, I don't mean the U.S.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.000]   Bank card.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.440]   If there is just going to be one card we can have to handle
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.400]   the everything category, anything you want to spend money on,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.040]   what that card would be.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.360]   And there's a few options.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.760]   And then what that means for the points game.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.840]   That said, I'm not going to cover everything I did in that episode.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.080]   So if you want to go deeper and listen to the best cash back cards
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.960]   for every spending category and how I think about points versus cash back,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.920]   go back to episode 170.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800]   OK, so you know how we're going to handle this.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   We are not going to look at anything 2% or below
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.840]   because there are so many cash back cards out there for 2%
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.960]   that I think now because of the cards that earn more than that,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.360]   a 2% card is actually leaving money on the table.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.800]   So today, I'm really only going to focus on the cards
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.240]   that earn more than 2% on all of your spending.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.960]   And fortunately, there's nine different cards that I found that do that.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.160]   But just to do a quick recap,
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.320]   I am not sharing all of this because I don't think points are valuable.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.200]   And I think we should all just switch everything to cash back.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.800]   I just want to share this because if you're using a one and a half
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.120]   or even a 2x points card for all your spending or just your everyday spending
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.440]   that doesn't fit into a bonus when you could be earning 4% cash back,
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.360]   that means you're valuing your points at 2 to 2.6 cents per point.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.600]   And while I've gotten that much value and even more sometimes for my points,
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.920]   if you look at the Points Guy's valuations or Frequent Miler's
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.480]   Reasonable Redemption values,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.080]   you'll notice that there isn't a single airline or hotel
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.920]   point that gets valued above 2 cents on either one of those lists.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.280]   Now, the Points Guy does say that some transferable credit card
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   points are worth more than 2 cents, but it caps at 2.05 cents.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.680]   And that's not because those points are necessarily transferable
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.680]   to places worth way more.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.480]   It's just that they get a premium
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.200]   because they have so many different ways you can redeem them.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   So given that, I want to start talking about the best cash back cards for everything.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.720]   And so I'm going to start with the new kid on the street,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.120]   the U.S.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.920]   Bank's Smartly Visa signature card, because it earns up to 4%
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.280]   cash back on every single purchase.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.440]   So I'm looking at the website.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   It's stated as a unlimited 2% cash back card,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.800]   because in order to get to 4%, you need to have some money stored at U.S.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.600]   Bank, and that money doesn't have to be in a checking account.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.560]   It could also be in a brokerage account.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.640]   And so you could transfer over an IRA or some stocks.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.240]   And if you transfer 5,000 or more dollars over or you hold
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.280]   $5,000 or more in your accounts, you get 2.5% on everything.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.120]   If you go over 50,000, you get 3% back on your card.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.360]   And if you go over $100,000, you get 4% back on everything.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.440]   Now, that is incredible.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.360]   I don't honestly even understand how this is possible,
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.760]   because as someone who now runs an e-commerce website,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.440]   I'm not paying 4% to run credit card transactions.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.560]   So how they can afford to give you 4%, I have no idea.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.520]   How long this will last, I don't know.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.680]   But I have multiple friends with this card, and they have gotten their 4% back.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.720]   They have not had transactions getting declined, and they've been very happy
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.400]   with their experience with U.S. Bank.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.680]   So a couple of the basics here, $0 annual fee, which is amazing.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.440]   No signup bonus.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.880]   So if you think a lot of credit cards are giving away a lot of value
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.840]   in a signup bonus, that's not happening here.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.640]   So that's some of the way that they're able to justify giving 4% back.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.800]   At least that's my assumption.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.200]   A couple other things about this card.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.400]   One, it's missing a lot of the common things
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.520]   you find from premium travel credit cards.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.880]   And I guess at a $0 annual fee, that's because it's not a premium card.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.000]   But when you look at the return, it is.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.320]   So there are no waived foreign transaction fees.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.120]   So if you use this card overseas, you're going to be paying 3%
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.240]   for all foreign transaction purchases.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.240]   There's also no rental car coverage, travel insurance, TSA or pre-check.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.520]   So a lot of those things are missing.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.480]   A couple of little small nuance things that I've read when I'm doing my research here.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.920]   There's no support for Google Voice phone numbers.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.280]   So if you are someone who doesn't like using your regular phone number,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.240]   that's a problem.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.480]   On the flip side, a good friend of mine has this card.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.560]   And he's really enjoyed the experience of using US Bank as a bank
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.200]   and the card together.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.160]   One example was he had hit his limit on the card
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   and he was able to log into the app,
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.520]   immediately pay off part of the card from his checking account
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.200]   and immediately be able to use that credit card for a purchase right away.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.760]   Now, one of the things that I will point out is that he also had a pretty low limit.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.160]   So this is someone that I know who regularly has high limits on other cards.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.080]   And the highest limit he was able to get on this card was only $15,000.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.080]   And so one of the drawbacks on this card is I have not heard a lot of stories
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.160]   of people getting really, really high limits.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.880]   And from my experience, doing a ton of research,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.360]   US Bank isn't too keen on you getting a $15,000 limit,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.680]   spending $15,000, paying it down, spending another $15,000,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.560]   paying it down, which is called credit cycling.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.520]   They don't love that.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.240]   Now, does that mean that if you do it one time, it's going to be a problem?
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.360]   Probably not.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.880]   But I think if you're consistently doing that and spending $50,000, $60,000 a month
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.520]   by paying your card down frequently, obviously, I don't know
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.040]   any of the underwriting criteria here, but there's a decent chance
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.400]   you could get your card canceled, shut down, your limit lowered, etc.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.920]   So those are some of the drawbacks.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.600]   That said, if you have $100,000 that you can park somewhere at US Bank
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.640]   and because you can do that with brokerage assets, it doesn't cost you anything.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.800]   It's not like you have to put it in a checking account
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.440]   that earns zero percent when you could be earning four percent.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.720]   So in my mind, this card seems like a no brainer.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.560]   Awesome card to be in your back pocket for that everything else category.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.920]   With the exception of a few things I'll bring up a little bit later.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.600]   So that is the US Bank Smartly card.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.840]   Now, there is another US Bank card.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.960]   And funny enough, the day the Smartly card came out,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   they stopped taking applications for it.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.920]   However, I have seen that you can product change into it.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.320]   And that's the US Bank Altitude Reserve card.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.160]   Now, because you can product change into it, I'm still going to touch on it.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.040]   But I'm only going to do that briefly because it's kind of interesting.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.000]   It is not an everything card in that there are plenty of purchases
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.400]   that will only earn one X or one and a half X points, which is not that exciting.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.080]   But the categories where it does earn are so broad
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.280]   that I feel like it's worth including here.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.360]   And that's because it earns three X points on travel and all mobile wallet spending.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.800]   So that's anywhere that you can pay with Apple Pay.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   And whether that's Apple Pay on your phone using tap to pay,
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.040]   or if you've noticed, there are a lot of websites now when you're using mobile
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.720]   or if you have a Mac using Safari, you can use Apple Pay on the web.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.800]   And that's not just Apple Pay.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.880]   It's Google Wallet and Samsung Pay as well.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.760]   That makes it effectively a three X points card.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.080]   However, there's this thing that US Bank has for these cards.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.760]   And I'll put a link in the show notes for more detail called real time rewards.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.560]   And any time you make a purchase in the travel category,
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.400]   they give you a text that says, hey, if you want, you can use your points
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.920]   to pay off this purchase and you can get one and a half cents per point.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.080]   Now, if you just go to redeem your points for statement credits
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.000]   and that kind of stuff, they're worth one cent.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.520]   So if you're earning three X points and you're able to redeem them at one
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.800]   and a half cents, then that makes it an effective four point five percent
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.560]   cashback card on all mobile wallet and travel purchases.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.880]   Now, I don't know about you guys and how you spend your money,
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.480]   but the vast majority of things I spend my money on
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.520]   that are not in bonus categories elsewhere, I can pay with mobile wallet.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.080]   I can pay with Apple Pay online and that kind of stuff.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.560]   So I felt like it was worth mentioning this card.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.840]   I know you can't sign up for it now, but if you do have another US Bank card,
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.080]   I have been told that some people are able to product change over to it.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.560]   One of the examples was the Altitude Go card.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.520]   So I just want to mention it.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.680]   It's also a much more kind of premium like travel card.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.200]   So it does have a four hundred dollar annual fee, but it comes with three
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.680]   hundred twenty five dollars of travel and dining credits
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.800]   that are so easy to use that I didn't even try to use them.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.480]   And they just showed up on the card.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.840]   And it has all the standard benefits that a high end travel card has.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.640]   You get airport lounge access, travel coverage, primary rental car coverage,
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.200]   some statuses on different rental car companies, a credit for global entry,
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.520]   no foreign transaction fees and all that kind of stuff.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.480]   So I've been really happy having the US Bank Altitude Reserve card.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.040]   Will I product change it to a smartly card or get a smartly card for right now?
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.360]   No, because most of where I'm spending money
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.000]   that is not earning more than an effective four percent
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.520]   is where I can use Apple Pay.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.800]   So this card is effectively a four and a half percent
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.920]   on almost everything card for me.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.760]   Costco is a great example of a place where we spend money
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.920]   and I can pay with Apple Pay.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.640]   This episode is brought to you by Viori, which is amazing
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.360]   because they are one of only the few brands I wear almost every single day.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.880]   I've got a shirt on. I've got the core shorts on.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.320]   I love Viori and I love that they bring a new perspective on performance apparel.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.600]   It's so versatile.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   It can be used for just about any activity,
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.920]   whether it's running, training, swimming, yoga, or even lounging
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.440]   or running errands or going out to dinner.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.440]   Seriously, I wear my meta pants out for dinner all the time.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.240]   But today I want to talk about their dream knit collection because it's amazing.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.280]   It is super soft, lightweight, moisture wicking,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.400]   but also has this amazing four way performance stretch
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.320]   that makes it so comfortable.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.960]   While it's almost impossible to narrow my Viori recommendations
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.520]   down to just one thing, I want you to check out the Ponto performance jogger
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.600]   for men or the performance jogger for women.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.880]   I know me and my wife, Amy, absolutely love them and wear them all the time.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.600]   Seriously, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.240]   And for everyone watching, they're offering 20% off your first purchase,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.920]   plus free shipping on U.S. orders over $75 and free returns.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.080]   So get yourself some of the most comfortable and versatile clothing
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.360]   on the planet at chrishutchins.com/viori.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.480]   That's V-U-O-R-I.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.920]   Again, that's chrishutchins.com/viori to discover the versatility of Viori clothing.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.320]   Exclusions apply.

[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.600]   This episode is brought to you by Copilot.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.080]   If you're looking to get your finances organized this year,
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.720]   you have to check out Copilot.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.880]   It's one of my favorite apps, and I check it almost every day
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.680]   because it makes it so seamless and easy to manage your money
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.200]   and track your spending, which for us has resulted in a huge boost to our savings.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.360]   And I've tried dozens of apps that do this.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   I've even made a whole episode about it.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.320]   But Copilot is the only one I've kept using, and I have no plans to stop.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.280]   You can link accounts at over 10,000 institutions,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.160]   and their AI-powered expense categorization is the best I've used
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.440]   with custom Amazon and Venmo integrations to make it even better.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.080]   You can completely design your spending categories and subcategories
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.840]   and easily set up rules to assign transactions to them in the future.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.280]   Thanks to Copilot, I have never had a better grasp on our spending and cash flow,
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.320]   which I'm pretty sure has resulted in thousands of dollars of savings every year.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.840]   So for the best app to track your spending, subscriptions, and investments,
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.200]   go to chrishutchins.com/copilot or click the link in the description
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.000]   to download Copilot and enter code "HAX" during onboarding for a two-month free trial.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.840]   Again, that's chrishutchins.com/copilot and the code "HAX2"
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.480]   for a free two-month trial of my favorite personal finance app.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.920]   Next card is the Robinhood Gold card.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.040]   Now, when this first got announced, it was unheard of.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.160]   3% on everything, that's wild.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.120]   And that was obviously short-lived with the US Bank Smartly card.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.400]   But here you get a 3% on everything card with no foreign transaction fees.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   It technically doesn't have an annual fee, but you can only get it
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.320]   if you have Robinhood Gold, which is $60 a year.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.720]   And there are a lot of other benefits of Robinhood Gold that I won't talk about,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.760]   but it's up to you to determine whether that is an annual fee or not,
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.840]   depending on whether you already have Robinhood Gold
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.160]   or the other benefits make up for it.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.560]   So pretty great option if you, for whatever reason, don't want a US Bank card
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.600]   or if you don't have the $100,000 you need to meet their minimum,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.000]   the US Bank card isn't a 4% card.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.120]   And so Robinhood Gold card is interesting.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.280]   The only hesitation I have, and one of the reasons
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.480]   I didn't get it out the gate, was that there were some mixed messages
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.840]   online about what kinds of purchases were qualifying.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.560]   And there were people who had bought gold at Costco and gotten that declined
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.560]   or made really large tax purchases and gotten that declined.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.720]   And having gone deep in Reddit and reading about this,
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   I don't think that those claims were as widely experienced
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.600]   as they felt in the beginning.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   I think it was a few people were complaining.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.520]   But if you do go read the terms of the card on rewards,
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.520]   they do say that purchases of precious metals, including gold,
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.760]   are not eligible for rewards.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.120]   Same goes for purchasing reloads of balances on gift cards
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.880]   or prepaid cards or cash equivalents, business type transactions,
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.200]   including reselling.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   So if you wanted to buy a bunch of stuff at Best Buy to be able to resell,
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.240]   that was something that the terms explicitly say would not be eligible
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:01.960]   for rewards.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.040]   There might be something like this in other card terms of services.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.960]   I went and looked and didn't find it.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.760]   But they say Robin Hood, in its sole discretion, determines
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.960]   whether a transaction constitutes an eligible purchase
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.440]   and has the right to deny points or remove points
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.640]   if they were already granted on a transaction that is ultimately deemed
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.560]   ineligible.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.360]   So if you're using this for regular spending,
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.960]   I don't think you're going to have a problem.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.200]   But if you're using this to try to do lots of things at scale,
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.360]   I think you might find out that their uncapped, unlimited rewards
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.960]   could come into issues, especially if you're doing a lot of business
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.800]   spending or reselling spending or things like that.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.720]   So I think it's a good option, especially if you don't have the capital
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.360]   to be able to earn the higher rates with the Smartly card.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.840]   Now, another card that I think is one that people probably weren't expecting
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.960]   to hear about is the Discover It card.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.080]   And Discover is so interesting because I'm looking at their website right now
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.120]   and they just say travel credit card.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.600]   So I'm like, which card is this?
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.800]   But when I click on it, it says it's the Discover It miles card.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.600]   And what's interesting here is technically this card only earns
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.000]   one and a half miles for every dollar spent.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.680]   So it's a one and a half X card.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:16.160]   But for the first year, you get two X miles, which makes it a 3% back card.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.120]   No annual fee.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.440]   Also, no sign up bonus, but surprisingly, no foreign transaction fees.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.720]   In fact, I didn't know this, but Discover has no foreign transaction
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.960]   fees on all credit cards.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.040]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.440]   Another cool thing.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.680]   This card seems to be very easy to get multiple times.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.960]   I saw a lot of people on Reddit post that someone had it four or five times.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.520]   And so getting it once, maybe your partner getting it the next year,
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.600]   maybe you getting it again the next year seems to be very possible.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.400]   I do know that Discover is not known for really, really high credit limits.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.760]   So that may be a challenge if you need to spend lots of money.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.200]   But a no annual fee, no need to get Robin Hood gold,
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.760]   like kind of straightforward, easy way to get three X for the first year
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.800]   is the Discover it miles card and potentially to be able to do it
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.200]   over and over again.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.800]   Added bonus, the card right now on their website
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.280]   says that it has 0% APR for the first 15 months.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.920]   And so in addition to getting this card, you also could potentially benefit
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.600]   from not having to completely pay it off right away
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.800]   and be able to invest the money and earn a return there,
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.600]   which is an interesting thing that were the limit of the card
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.840]   to be high enough, that'd be interesting.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.120]   If you have this card and you can earn 3% back on everything for a year,
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.760]   carrying a balance actually limits how much you can spend over the year.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.120]   And so it might not actually be worth it from that perspective.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.760]   But interesting card.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.960]   I've actually never had a Discover card.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.080]   There are a few cards that I've never had.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.200]   I've never had a Citi thank you point card or a Discover card.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.960]   There are things that a part of me wants solely just to have the experience.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.160]   But then another part of me
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   doesn't think it's worth a new slot, given all the other options.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160]   Next on the list is Bank of America.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.360]   And I actually have a lot of recent experience
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.960]   because we've opened a handful of Bank of America cards recently.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.000]   And Bank of America's lineup is pretty interesting.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.520]   And it was incredibly interesting before the launch of the U.S.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.680]   Bank Smartly card and the Robin Hood card.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.600]   And I'll say for a couple of reasons, it's maybe still interesting.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.520]   And if you look at any Bank of America card on face value,
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.320]   it's probably not going to be that exciting.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.560]   And it becomes exciting with their preferred rewards program.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.120]   And I'm pulling up right now.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.360]   They have a gold tier, a platinum tier, a platinum honors tier and a diamond tier.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   And the reason that gets interesting is because whatever you earn
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.920]   on your credit card gets multiplied based on the tier you have.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.200]   And so if you have $20,000 of combined balance
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.720]   across your accounts at Bank of America, which includes any accounts
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   you have at Merrill, their partner brokerage firm,
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.160]   you get a increase of 25% of the points.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.160]   If you have over $50,000, then you qualify for the platinum tier
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.840]   and you get a 50% boost.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.880]   And then at platinum honors, you get a 75% boost.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.320]   And then at the diamond tier, you actually get no extra benefits
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.160]   on your credit card.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.680]   I'm not actually sure what other extra benefits you do get.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.720]   So I don't know why that tier would be interesting to anyone.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.000]   I've never heard of anyone in the points world talk about it.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.560]   Now, as for which cards make this interesting,
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.120]   there are actually a quite a large number of them.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.080]   The main ones are the unlimited cash, travel rewards, premium rewards
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.600]   and premium rewards elite.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.040]   And the unlimited cash and the travel rewards also come in a business version.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.440]   And so one of the reasons that I think this is interesting is
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.880]   it is really tough to get really great cash back on business cards.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.040]   There aren't a lot of business cards offering more than 2% cash back.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.640]   But the unlimited cash and the travel rewards business cards do,
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.840]   assuming you qualify for those higher tiers.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.360]   And so how this works is the unlimited cash and the travel rewards
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.400]   both earn 1.5 X or 1.5%.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.160]   And if you multiply that 1.5% times 1.75,
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.680]   because you get that boost if you're in the platinum honors camp,
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.160]   you go to 2.625%.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.040]   Now, on the consumer side, you might say 2.625% is nothing
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.680]   compared to 4% on the US Bank Smartly card.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.800]   And you would be right.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.240]   And so it's actually potentially pretty interesting to consider this
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.120]   only if you need a business card.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.960]   For some reason, you can't qualify for the US Bank card
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.480]   or if you spend so much money that the limits
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.920]   you can get on your US Bank card just aren't enough.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.600]   And that's because I've had a lot of people I know at Bank of America
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.600]   be successful in getting incredibly large limits with Bank of America
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.840]   that I have not seen with US Bank.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.160]   And so I mentioned the unlimited cash and the travel rewards.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.200]   One other bonus, they do offer sign up bonuses on both those cards.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.000]   $200 or 20,000 points.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.600]   And they both actually offer 0% APR for 15 months.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.760]   The only real difference between the two that I could find
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.560]   is the travel rewards has no foreign transaction fees.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.280]   The unlimited cash has a 3% foreign transaction fee.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.800]   And the travel rewards card seems to earn miles.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:03.080]   But it seems very easy to turn those miles into statement credits worth a penny.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.440]   So it's effectively seems like the same thing.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.480]   So I'm not really sure the difference between those two cards practically,
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.560]   but they are separate.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.000]   And it has not been hard for me on the business side
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   to be able to get the card limit to be up north of $50,000,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.600]   which has been super helpful on the business side.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.760]   The one thing I will say on the personal and business side,
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.560]   obviously, you have to open up an account.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.800]   One cool thing is that once you open that account, you can fund it
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:33.280]   and you qualify for their status for a full year once you have that balance.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.480]   So if you put $100,000 in your account, you can quickly qualify.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.800]   They have a kind of accelerated way to earn your preferred reward status,
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   and it lasts for a year.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.920]   So you don't need to have that $100,000 all the time.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.120]   I believe it's on a rolling three month average to qualify again for a year.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.160]   So probably months 10, 11, 12, you might need to have that $100,000 balance.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.160]   But because you can open up a brokerage account and transfer over securities
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.960]   or IRAs, it makes it pretty easy to not worry about the fact
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.040]   that their checking account or their savings account
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.240]   isn't going to earn a lot of interest.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.200]   I will say opening up the Merrill brokerage account for the business
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.720]   is not the easiest thing to do.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.640]   And so for us, we were able to move some business assets
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.840]   into the checking account and qualify for a year.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.160]   And now we have like six more months to figure out how to open up
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.080]   this business brokerage account.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.720]   I know how to do it, but it requires a physical paper form
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.520]   that I believe needs to be faxed or brought into a branch.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.520]   And so I just haven't gotten around to it.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.680]   The other two cards that they have that are not the travel
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.160]   and unlimited cash are the premium rewards cards.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.680]   And the base one, the premium rewards card
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.080]   practically has the same spending return,
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.760]   except that you also get two X points on travel.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.600]   So instead of one and a half X on everything, you get one and a half X
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.760]   on everything and two X on travel and dining.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.000]   So I did briefly mention the premium rewards and the premium rewards elite card.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.720]   And they also get one and a half X on everything.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.480]   With your platinum honor status would go to two point six to five percent.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.520]   However, the bonus is that they get two X on travel and dining.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.640]   And with your platinum honor status, that brings it up to three and a half X
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.000]   on travel and dining.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.080]   And so depending on how you spend and what the blended
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.400]   average of your travel dining versus non travel dining,
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.720]   this could pretty easily find its way to be close to or even north
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.200]   of a three percent on everything card.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.240]   And these cards both have pretty good signup bonuses, at least relative
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   to the US bank card, which doesn't have one at all.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.400]   And the premium rewards elite card has a seventy five thousand point signup bonus.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.880]   Points are ending up being worth one cent.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.720]   So a six hundred and a seven hundred and fifty dollar signup bonus.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.320]   Now, interesting.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.440]   If you assume that maybe you can average three percent on everything.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.760]   So I was trying to compare this to the US bank card.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.440]   So three percent on everything here, because you're getting three
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.560]   and a half on travel and dining and two point six to five on everything else.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.960]   And you want to compare that to the US bank smartly card.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.240]   Well, you're earning one percent there, but you're getting a seventy five
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.280]   thousand point signup bonus, which is seven hundred and fifty dollars.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.960]   So effectively, because you're getting that seven hundred
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.880]   and fifty dollar signup bonus on the premium rewards elite card.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.280]   It's kind of like getting a four percent return
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.320]   on the first seventy five thousand dollars you spend on the card.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.200]   In a way, so you could view it like that, in a way, it's actually better
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.840]   because you get it all up front.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.920]   So I would say, given the fact that this has a signup bonus,
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.680]   it could be a better card for however long it takes you to spend seventy
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.880]   five thousand dollars.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.040]   And if you had a heavier weighting towards travel and dining spend,
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.640]   then it would actually go up and take you even further
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.840]   because you'd be only earning an incremental half a percent,
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.480]   getting four percent versus three point five.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.800]   Then you would getting four percent versus three or two point six to five
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.120]   if you were to use one of the other Bank of America cards.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.280]   So both those cards do have an annual fee.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.480]   Ninety five for the regular five fifty for the elite.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.440]   But to make up for that, they have a bunch of credits.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.640]   And so the ninety five dollar version gives you a global entry
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.800]   credit every four years.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.040]   It gives you a hundred dollar airline incidental credit, which we've found
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.440]   to be really easy to use without even trying.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.960]   And with the elite card, you get four priority pass memberships.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.960]   Now, that's not four authorized user cards with one premium rewards elite card.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.960]   You get four individual priority pass memberships that include restaurant
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.560]   access, which is something that almost every other issuer has lost.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.840]   And then on the cards, you get rental status, travel, coverage,
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.200]   purchase protection, that kind of stuff.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.240]   There's also no foreign transaction fees.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.400]   And then finally, on the elite card, yes, it has a much higher annual fee at five
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.880]   fifty, but you're getting a three hundred dollar airline credit and one hundred
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.400]   fifty dollar lifestyle credit, which total four hundred fifty.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.800]   So effectively, you're paying one hundred dollars for that card.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.960]   But depending on how you value four priority pass membership
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.640]   and the sign up bonus, you know, it could break even.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.960]   That's the card we went with.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.000]   And so far it's been great.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.520]   There also is one perk of the premium rewards elite card
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.320]   that actually might make it very competitive with the U.S.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.440]   Bank smartly card.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.480]   And that is that if you want to book travel using Bank of America's
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.120]   travel portal on domestic or international airfare in any class,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.160]   you get a 20 percent discount using your points.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.240]   So what that means is if you had one hundred thousand points
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.760]   that would normally be redeemable for a thousand dollar statement credit
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.440]   or a thousand dollars of travel,
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.880]   you actually could go use those points and get a discount.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.480]   So that thousand dollars of travel that you want to book
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.760]   would actually be 80,000 points or that 100,000 points
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.920]   would actually get you one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   worth of travel because you take 20 percent off 1250.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:54.920]   So if you add 25 percent to earning two point six to five percent on everything,
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.840]   you get three point two eight percent on everything.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:02.320]   Or if you add that 25 percent boost to earning three point five X
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.760]   on travel and dining, you end up with four point three seven five percent back.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.920]   So obviously, the requirement here is you book your travel
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.320]   in the Bank of America portal.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.160]   I have not gone through that experience yet.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.960]   I don't know how hard or easy it is.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.080]   I don't know how frustrating it is.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.400]   I've talked to the past about how I prefer not to book in the travel portal.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.920]   But if I'm able to get an extra 25 percent of value from all my points,
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.760]   I don't know, it might be worth it, especially for certain trips.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.200]   But given how easy it is to have a simple straight four percent
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.920]   on everything card with the US Bank Smartly, is this even worth it?
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.920]   I would say probably not unless maybe you're already a Bank of America
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.760]   customer and you love it, or if you really value having a much higher limit.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.640]   Right. If you're spending 30, 40, 50 thousand dollars a month,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.760]   then that US Bank Smartly card can't keep up.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.760]   And so that card might feel like a four percent card.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.240]   But if it can only cover half your spending, then what's the backup card?
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.400]   And what is your effective rate?
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.280]   And so I would say that for someone who spends more than 15,
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.840]   20 thousand dollars, which seems to be about the limit
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.800]   people have been getting for the Smartly card, if you're spending more than that,
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.000]   looking to Bank of America, especially the premium rewards
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.040]   elite, might be a good option.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.080]   This episode is brought to you by Element.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.280]   Now, I love Element and I use it all the time because it helps anyone
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.920]   stay hydrated without the sugar and other dodgy ingredients
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.320]   in popular electrolyte and sports drinks.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.520]   And that's important because electrolyte deficiency or imbalance
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.920]   can cause headaches, cramps, fatigue, brain fog and weakness.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.600]   In fact, Element is a zero sugar electrolyte drink mix

[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.200]   to stop overpaying on taxes.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.400]   The last card I'm going to mention is the Alliant Credit Union Visa Signature card.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.200]   And I don't know anyone that has this card.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.400]   I've never had this card.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.920]   I've never had an account at Alliant.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:44.400]   But the one interesting thing is it is a 2.5% cash back on everything card.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.080]   It does have a few hoops that you have to jump through, but no annual fee,
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.600]   no foreign transaction fees, does have some travel protections.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.560]   It does not have a signup bonus.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.440]   And so if for whatever reason, none of the other options make sense for you.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.960]   I said at the outset, I'm going to talk about cards that earn
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.680]   more than 2% on everything.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.400]   I think this qualifies because it's 2.5%.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.920]   The only catch is it's only on up to $10,000 per billing cycle.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.920]   So $120,000 of spend.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.000]   I know that's plenty for most people.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.880]   So I thought it was worth including.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.400]   After that, it rolls over to 1.5%.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.080]   The requirements you need to jump through to make this work is you
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.800]   do need to enroll in e-statements.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.520]   I imagine everyone listening here prefers getting electronic
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.840]   statements to paper ones.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.600]   And then you do need to open up their high rate checking account,
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.840]   which is not very high rate.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.240]   It's 0.25%.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.080]   And you need to have one deposit a month.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.560]   And that could be a direct deposit, an ATM deposit, a mobile check
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.840]   deposit, or even a transfer from another bank, and you need to
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.960]   maintain a balance of a thousand dollars or more now, if you compare
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.280]   that thousand dollars, what you would earn earning 4% somewhere
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.960]   else relative to a quarter of a percent here, it's going to cost
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.400]   you $37 and 50 cents a year.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.640]   So not too high, but I would effectively assume that, okay,
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.760]   this is kind of a $37 and 50 cent annual fee card.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.040]   If I have to open up that account.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.520]   That said, I think all of the other options are pretty great.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.040]   But if I go through how this looks in my head and I compare them really
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.640]   quickly, if you have a hundred thousand dollars that you can move in
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.000]   brokerage or dollars, US Bank Smartly seems like the easiest, unless you
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.320]   need a really high limit and Bank of America seems to make that a little
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.760]   bit easier, or if you need a business card, that seems to be easier.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.600]   If a lot of your spending is mobile wallet and travel, and you can open
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.200]   up a US Bank card and you're able or eligible to product change over
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.800]   the altitude reserve could be interesting.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.760]   If you're willing to use Robin hood, I know there are a lot of people
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.280]   that have strong feelings about it.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.400]   3% seems to make sense and be the best option.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.600]   If you don't have a hundred thousand dollars to transfer over.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.840]   The discover card seems to be a good backup to that though.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.240]   It's only effective for a year.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.040]   So you'd have to keep reapplying for it or opening it with your partner.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.720]   But if all of those don't make sense, the Alliant as a backup
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.560]   earning two and a half percent is interesting, but at the point
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.200]   we're talking about two and a half percent back on everything you
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.600]   spend money on, I start to think about whether I would actually
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.760]   rather just have two X points with something like the capital
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.520]   one venture X or the venture card.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.640]   So that's the summary here.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.280]   Now I said that was the single best card, but I couldn't help myself
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.200]   from doing a really quick look at the card optimizer tool I built.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.400]   And looking for the best cards that might compliment that.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.160]   Let's say you decide, you know what, this is the year for cashback.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.160]   Let's forget about points.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.400]   What do I do?
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.680]   Are there any other cards that you could pair with a card earning
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.360]   three, 4% cash back that even makes sense?
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.760]   If we start first, assuming you have the smartly card.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.520]   It's a really easy filter.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.400]   You're looking for any card where you can earn more than 4%.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.680]   And there aren't a lot of cards, even on categories that earn that much more.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:55.720]   The most common cards that I would say can beat 4% are there's a handful of
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.120]   cards that do these rotating categories or categories that you pick like the
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.200]   bank of America customized cash, the city custom cash, us bank cash plus.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:11.640]   Where you earn 5, sometimes 6% on some amount of money that when you annualize
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:17.440]   it ends up being around six to $10,000 a year, but if you go all the way to the
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.080]   top and say, okay, let's look at a 5% card.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:26.160]   That's going to earn that on $10,000 a year relative to getting 4%.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:30.600]   You're really just getting an extra 1% on $10,000, which is just $100.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.480]   Now, if I saw a hundred dollars on the side of the road, I'm definitely going
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.120]   to pick it up, but I'm not sure that I would open up a new credit card, add it
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.000]   to my wallet, think about which card I'm using, think about when I've spent too
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.200]   much so that I don't use it anymore to earn an extra hundred dollars.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.440]   So if you've got the smartly card and you're earning 4%, I can't really make a
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.800]   case for any other card unless you're focused on a welcome bonus or you want
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.920]   to earn points and on that welcome bonus point, we're going to get to that.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.440]   Now, if for some reason you don't have the smartly card and you're really only
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.560]   at 3%, then there are a few more options.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.680]   Those category cards now are going to earn you an extra two to 3%, which
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:13.440]   could be worth $200 a year, maybe $300 a year, still probably not worth it
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.160]   relative to what you could get from another card in your arsenal, but where
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.040]   I think it could be worth it is not the rotating cards that have a limit, but
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.000]   there are some cashback cards out there where you can earn four points or 4%
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.200]   back on a handful of categories, and when those cards come into play, I
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.920]   think if you're sitting with the Robinhood card earning 3%, it could be
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.400]   worth putting some of your spend on them.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.000]   And the first one I'm going to mention might really surprise you because I
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.280]   don't think I've ever really considered it, but that is the Verizon Visa card.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.840]   Now, the obvious challenge here is you can only get this card if you're a
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.320]   Verizon customer, which means you're probably already spending way more
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.040]   money on your phone bill than you would need to somewhere else, at least based
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.360]   on my experience as a former Verizon customer, but if you are eligible for
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.920]   this card as a Verizon customer, not only do you get $10 per line discount
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.360]   on your Verizon bill, but you get unlimited uncapped Forex on dining,
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.040]   grocery, and gas, so it's effectively just 4% cash back, you're earning
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.960]   these Verizon rewards, but the one caveat I'd say is those Verizon rewards
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.120]   seem to only be able to be used to offset your bill, and I couldn't find
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.400]   anyone that could explain what would happen if you earned more Verizon
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.920]   rewards in a year than your bill.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.160]   Like what do you do with that money?
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.240]   How do you get it out?
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.960]   Can you pay a negative balance in your bill and get reimbursed?
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:39.560]   That was a little bit unclear, but if you're looking for a supplement card
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.560]   for the Robinhood gold card, and you spend a ton of money on dining, groceries,
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.720]   and gas, and you have Verizon, that could be a pretty rewarding experience.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.880]   There's also a gold card out there from a very popular bank that has Forex on
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:59.680]   dining and groceries, and that is capped at, I believe, $25,000 and $50,000.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:05.120]   And so if you're spending a lot a year in those categories, that could be worth
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.520]   it, because it's not just capped at $6,000 or $10,000, so if you have a 3X
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.480]   card, that could make sense.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.320]   If you spend a ton of money on hotels or flights, there's the autographed journey,
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:19.000]   there's a platinum card, those could make sense, but otherwise, that's kind of it.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.720]   Like if you have a 3% or 4% cash back card, I don't know if you really need
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.080]   a compliment, unless maybe you have the 3% and you spend a ridiculous amount of
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.040]   money in a couple categories that you could earn a little bit more, but we're
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.800]   talking probably, for most people, hundreds of dollars, not thousands or
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.840]   more, but to go back to all those point valuations, there are plenty of options
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.960]   where points are worth more than one cent, right?
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.840]   You can look at almost every airline point and Hyatt points, mostly not the
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.960]   other hotel points, points are worth more than one cent, so doing this analysis
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.200]   that I did, comparing one to one might not always make sense, right?
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   If you're looking at a card that earns 4X points on groceries, is it fair to
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.200]   compare that equally to 4% cash back?
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.880]   Really depends on you, but probably not.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.240]   If you have a 3% cash back card and you're comparing it to earning three
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:16.360]   transferable points on dining, I don't know, I'd probably take the points
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.080]   over three cents almost every day.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.600]   So earning points might change some of this calculus, but when you go back to
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.320]   looking at your everyday spend, if you're buying something online from a random
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.760]   retailer and the best points card you have is going to earn 2X points, I really
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.520]   think for all those transactions, you should consider whether cash back is a
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.840]   better option and in that episode that I talked about earlier, number 170, I
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.120]   talked a lot about how buying points kind of changes this because it doesn't mean
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.280]   you can't benefit from the value of points, you can use that cash back to go
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:51.960]   buy points.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.080]   Sure, it doesn't feel as free because you have these points and you can't really
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.040]   convert them to cash and you get to take these vacations, but practically I think
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.360]   it might be a better ROI for a lot of those purchases if you're only earning
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.600]   one, one and a half or 2X points.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.240]   But I mentioned welcome bonuses earlier and I really need to come back there
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.680]   because I think it makes a case for throwing out everything we just talked
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:19.560]   about and I brought this up before even in episode 170, but I went a lot deeper
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.760]   this time and I think it's worth diving into.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:28.040]   So I went to our site, allthehacks.com/cards and I looked at some of the
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:28.800]   top bonuses.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:34.240]   So for example, the Capital One Spark Cash Plus, it's a $2,000 signup bonus on
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:39.440]   $30,000 of spend and you're getting 2% back on all that spend, makes it
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:46.120]   effectively an 8.7% cash back card on the first $30,000 until you hit that
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:46.600]   bonus.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:53.400]   The Capital One Venture X is 75,000 points or $750 at least on $4,000 of
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:39:00.360]   spend, which makes it effectively a 20.75% cash back card, but again, only on
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.800]   that first $4,000.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:08.240]   There's another offer for 60,000 points on $4,000 spend, makes it 16% back.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:13.720]   There's a hotel card that earns 175,000 hotel points that I'd probably value at
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.680]   around $875 and you get those after spending 6,000.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.840]   So that's 15.5% and I can go on and on and on.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:27.360]   There are so many cards that earn meaningful percentage of cash back if you
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.560]   look at the effective cash back from the welcome bonus.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:36.160]   In fact, I went through all 59 welcome offers I have listed on the page and
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:41.400]   which is normally sorted by best offer and there isn't a single offer where the
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:46.400]   earnings you'd get from spending your way to that offer is less than 7% effective
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:51.560]   cash back and that's valuing every single point in mile at one cent and all the
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.280]   hotel points except Hyatt at half a cent.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.720]   And it doesn't factor in the fact that many of those cards are going to earn
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.320]   more points when you're spending your way towards that welcome bonus in different
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.280]   categories, whether they earn in travel categories, dining categories, et cetera.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:14.240]   So I want to share some of the analysis that I did because it really changes my
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.840]   mind on how I think about spending.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.040]   So from the analysis, I learned a lot of things, but first off, there are actually
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.800]   way more than 59 cards out there.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.200]   That's how many I had listed on the site with a welcome bonus.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   So as I was going through the list, first I decided to add another 30 to the site.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.920]   So hopefully by the time you're here, there's 89 or more cards on the site and
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.920]   there will always be some cards I don't include, but I am trying to include
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.600]   everything I find that's worth adding.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.920]   If you look at the long tail of random cruise cards, cards, just for people that
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.480]   have poor credit and are unsecured cards and have no bonuses or even earning, I'm
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.640]   not including all of them.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.880]   And I think you all know that some of the links on the website are partners of the
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.760]   show, and we earn an affiliate commission when you use those links.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.360]   So first off, thank you to everyone who does use those.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.960]   They're a big way to support the show.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.920]   And it means a ton to me, Amy, and all of us, but there are many cards where we
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.600]   don't have a partnership and I'm still going to add them to the site.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.560]   I'm still going to try to link to the best offer.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.160]   And what we're going to do is I'm going to ask all the members from the All the
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.000]   Hacks membership if they have any referral links and I'll use those links.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.960]   And if they don't, I'm just going to find the best offer I can on the website,
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.000]   probably on the issuer's website.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.680]   However, I do want to make one big change today, which will definitely cost us
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.120]   money, but I think is worth doing in the long run.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.360]   And that is that even for cards where we do have links that we earn an affiliate
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.800]   commission from, if there is a better link out there, whether it's a public
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.120]   offer or a referral link from our members, I'm actually going to use that
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.360]   link instead of our affiliate link.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:44.040]   But it also means that you can hopefully learn to rely on our site as the best
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.720]   place to find any card offer anytime.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.560]   Now, I know I'm supposed to make business decisions that increase
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.800]   our revenue, not decrease it.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.000]   But my hope is that in the long run, it doesn't matter.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.920]   And that this actually ends up being a great choice.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:01.400]   And the first reason is that if we make our site the best place to find the best
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.560]   offer for any card, I think more of you will come to the site.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.320]   I think it'll save you time.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.920]   You won't need to go searching around.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.520]   If that happens, maybe the links where we do have partner links and the offers we
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.280]   have are the best offers out there.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.160]   Maybe those links will get used more.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.960]   Second, it will help us continue to earn your trust as being a valuable resource.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.920]   And I can't quantify how much that's worth, but I definitely know it's not zero.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.240]   And finally, since we'll be sharing a lot of member referral links, the value of
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.200]   being an AllTheHacks member will go way up.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:37.160]   In fact, most credit card referral offers are worth anywhere from $100 to $500.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:42.160]   So if your link gets used even just once or twice a year, you'd earn way more from
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.160]   that credit card referral than you even pay for the membership.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.040]   And it would be such an obvious decision for people to join.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.360]   And in fact, we do that currently with some referral links.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.600]   And I know one member that told me she's made back over 10x the cost
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.200]   to join just in a few months.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.280]   So obviously if you have credit cards with referral links and you're
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.120]   interested in joining the membership and participating, you can
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.960]   go to allthehacks.com/join.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.720]   Now, keep in mind that offers do change all the time.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.720]   So it's not possible that the site will be perfect.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.560]   If you ever find a better offer out there, please email us,
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.880]   podcast@allthehacks.com, but also I want you to get the most points.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.720]   So by all means, if you ever find a better link, use that link.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.120]   But for everything where we do have the best offers, thank you so much in
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.760]   advance for supporting us and using the links on the site at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.480]   Okay.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.680]   Sorry for that detour.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.640]   Back to my analysis of what I found digging into all these welcome bonuses.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:42.240]   The median welcome bonus was $600 and the medium spend needed to hit that
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:49.680]   bonus was $4,000, which is an effective 15% cashback or 16% cashback when you
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.960]   account for the points earned from spending to get that bonus.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.040]   And I'm just assuming that card earns at least 1% back on its spend.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.400]   Now, the biggest bonus on the list was the Spark Cash Plus card with a $2,000
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   bonus on $30,000 of spend, but accounting for the 2% back you'd get on that $30,000
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.000]   of spend, it's really a $2,600 bonus that you'd end up earning from that spend.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.880]   8.67%, pretty interesting.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:21.480]   But 8.67% is not actually that high given that 21 of the cards on this site, which
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.840]   is over a third of them, had an average cashback rate or effective cashback rate
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:34.120]   on the welcome bonus spend of over 20% with the top card earning 61% back in the
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.880]   form of a $300 bonus after only $500 of spend.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:43.800]   So obviously that's a small bonus in the absolute terms, but in terms of the
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.720]   percent back, 61% is pretty amazing.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.920]   Though part of what I realized when I said that was there were a couple of cards I
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.400]   forgot.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.560]   So the Barclays Hawaiian card, which hopefully is on the site by the time you
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.720]   look at this, is 70,000 points after your first purchase.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.400]   So let's assume that first purchase is $1.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.800]   That means that if you get the card, put $1 on it, you'd earn what I'll call at
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:13.440]   least $700 of value on $1 of spend, which is actually a 70,000% effective cashback
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.520]   rate, which is just wild.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.560]   This episode is brought to you by Built Rewards, which is an amazing points
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.440]   program with so many ways to earn, including on your rent, where you don't
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.960]   even need to check with your landlord.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.760]   So let me explain.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.640]   First, there's no cost to join Built, and as a member, you'll earn valuable
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.880]   points on rent and on your everyday spending.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.600]   Built points can be transferred to your favorite hotels and airlines, and
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.920]   even the ones you haven't heard of.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.920]   There are over 500 airlines and 700,000 hotels and properties around the world
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.720]   you can redeem your built points toward.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.200]   Points can be redeemed towards a future rent payment and unique experiences
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   that only Built members can access.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.720]   So if you're not earning points on rent, my question is why not?
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.800]   Start earning points on rent you're already paying by going
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.000]   to chrishutchins.com/built.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.640]   That's chrishutchins.com/built, B-I-L-T.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.600]   Make sure to use our URL so they know we sent you chrishutchins.com/built or
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.440]   the link in the description to start earning points on your rent payments today.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.160]   Finally, if you were to somehow be able to sign up for all 59 cards on the site
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:20.880]   today, you would need to spend $307,000 to get all 59 bonuses, which would be
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:29.360]   worth $41,925, which is a 13.66% return on all your spend effective cashback.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.600]   Now, obviously that doesn't include the 30 cards I mentioned I'm going to try to
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.160]   add, and if you have a partner or a player two, you can double all those numbers.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.160]   So my guess is by the time I add all these cards and all these bonuses, and if you
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:45.880]   and your partner got them all, you'd probably be able to earn at least 13%
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.080]   back on a million dollars of spend.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.800]   Could you practically get approved for that many cards in a year?
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.720]   Probably not.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.840]   But I do know there are tons of people who open five to 10 cards a year and their
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.160]   partner does the same thing.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.720]   And as they do it, their credit score continues to go up.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.200]   So I think that number seems totally reasonable.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:07.280]   So I just looked at 10 offers that you could get to hit $30,000 of spend.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:13.000]   And if you really want to maximize things, you'd get $6,800 back, which is
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.880]   effectively a 23% cashback rate.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:21.200]   And if you wanted to do that same $30,000 of spend on just five cards, you'd lower
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:29.160]   the bonus to $4,125, but it's still 13.75% back, at least as an effective cashback
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:33.000]   rate, obviously some of these points can be worth a lot more if you use them the
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.240]   right way, but even if we're just valuing them at one cent a point, that is an
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:41.760]   incredible amount of cashback compared to the first half of this episode, we were
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.320]   just talking about earning a max of 4%.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.440]   So I could obviously keep going.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.480]   This is a lot of fun for me, but I think this is a good place to stop.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:54.160]   And the big takeaway here is I think that you should be thinking about earning the
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.000]   most back by first deciding how many cards you're comfortable opening up each
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.920]   year to hit bonuses.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.800]   Then look at the best cards at the time you're opening them and the best bonuses
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:09.800]   on them, and if you can account for all of your spending in a year, right, if you
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:14.040]   only spend $30,000 a year, I would make a case that you shouldn't open up any of
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:19.320]   these cashback cards and you should instead open somewhere between five and
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.320]   10 cards a year.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:24.040]   And if you're with your partner, that's two to five cards per person, and that
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:30.240]   would get you 13 to 23% back on all of your spending and more if you value
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.720]   points more than one cent.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.320]   And so I think that's the right strategy.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.800]   Now, if you're someone who spends a million dollars a year, I don't think you
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:40.640]   can do this strategy.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.120]   I think you're going to run out pretty quickly because by the time you open
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.680]   your 30th credit card in a year, I think you're going to get a lot of declines
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.120]   from banks and issuers.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:53.080]   That said, if you're someone who's spending a much smaller amount of money,
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:57.120]   which is probably more like all of us, I think there are a lot of options that
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:01.840]   give us way more cash back, way more points than any of these other things.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:07.560]   So I just push you all to think about whether welcome bonuses is actually the
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.200]   best way to manage your spend.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.720]   And you can go look at all the cards to decide what the effective earning is and
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.160]   also how much you have to spend.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.440]   Because if you're someone who spends a lot of money, yes, you might get the best
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:24.040]   absolute value from that Hawaiian card, but you only have to spend $1 on it.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.120]   And so it doesn't last very long.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:32.440]   Whereas that Spark Cash Plus card, sure the earning rate was lower at sub 10%,
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.360]   but you could use it for $30,000 of spend.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.360]   And so obviously also that's a business card.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.520]   So those kinds of things come into play as well.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:44.440]   But I'd say if you're listening to this show, there's a decent chance that you do
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.760]   something in your life that would qualify you for a business card as a sole
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.880]   proprietor at a minimum.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:52.360]   So I'll put a link in the show notes to an article about that.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.160]   But there are a lot of ways that you might be eligible that you weren't even
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.120]   thinking of after you figure out how much you're comfortable opening up cards for
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.320]   welcome bonuses, whatever spending you have left, then look at whether it makes
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.040]   sense to go get a cash back card, like the smartly card or one of the others we
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:07.560]   talked about.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.880]   I know for me, this is an area where I struggle.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.760]   I just went through this analysis to tell you that you shouldn't be spending money
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:21.800]   on a 4% card, a 3% card, or really any card, because I can't think of any card
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.920]   that earns better than welcome bonus spend.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.560]   But I can tell you that I'm not going to go open 10 cards a year.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.280]   And I don't know why, because I know that it's not going to really affect my
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:31.720]   score.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.160]   I actually understand the mechanics of it and the different approval rules.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.360]   But for some reason, it just feels like a lot of hassle.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:42.360]   And that's something I'm going to work on this year because it's not actually that
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:42.960]   much hassle.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.680]   And in fact, it's January 30th as I record this.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.400]   And I think between Amy and I, we've probably opened at least two cards so far
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.040]   in January.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:56.040]   So I am trying to live by this new thing, but I get why it feels like a lot because
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:56.600]   I've been there.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:59.720]   It feels like, "Do I really want to open another card?"
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.800]   But then I meet people who opened 30 cards last year and had zero issues.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:08.880]   And because they were earning an average of 10% to 20% back throughout the year,
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.920]   they just got so much more out of their spend.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:16.120]   And so I challenge you all to think about this and push yourself to look up some of
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.640]   the different rules for issuers.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:21.320]   There are rules that limit how many cards you can open in a window.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.480]   There are some issuers that are more sensitive to recent card openings.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.360]   I believe back in an episode I did with Sebastian Fung from AskSebi, we talked
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.800]   about some of the sequencing here.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.400]   So go back and look for that episode.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.160]   But I hope this was helpful.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.560]   If you want to go deeper on some of these questions or even ask me or our
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.800]   community, I invite you to join the All The Hacks membership where I try to answer
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.920]   everyone else's questions.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.760]   And I even put out some mini episodes in the last few months that go deeper and
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.440]   into areas that I just can't share too publicly about.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.640]   So you can find more of that on all thehacks.com/join.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.200]   I hope those stories were awesome.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.960]   If you have some of your own, please continue sending them in.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.120]   I love hearing them.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.560]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.160]   I really appreciate all the time you put in here.

[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.320]   earn status, maximize your cash back and everything else.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.040]   That is it for this week.
