[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Well, why does the Bible stress the power of Jesus' name?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   The question comes from a listener named Jared.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.000]   Hello, Pastor John, a question for you
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.540]   that my wife and I have wondered about for a while now.
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.040]   Why the biblical emphasis on praising the name of Jesus
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.600]   and praying in the name of Jesus?
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.400]   Of course, we want to, and it's a pattern we see
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.160]   all over the New Testament, especially in the book of Acts.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.120]   And here he cites Acts 2, chapter 3, chapter 4,
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.680]   chapter 5, chapter 8, chapter 9, chapter 10,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.880]   chapter 16, 19, 26, and in Paul,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.000]   in 1 Corinthians 1, 2, Philippians 2, 10,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.520]   it's all over the place.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.200]   To ask it another way, why is there power in Christ's name
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.400]   rather than saying there's power in Christ's person?
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.200]   What would you say to Jared and his wife?
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.320]   - Well, the answer to that last question is easy.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.160]   There isn't.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.400]   There isn't power in Christ's name
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.400]   rather than saying there's power in Christ's person.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.040]   There is power in Christ's name
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.040]   because there is power in Christ's person.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.920]   But Jared knows that.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.240]   That was just a freak of wording.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.080]   He knows that.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.720]   What he really wants to know, I think,
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.440]   is what he said at the beginning.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.440]   Why do we see such an emphasis on praising
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.560]   the name of Jesus and praying in the name of Jesus,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.400]   doing all these things in the name of Jesus?
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.400]   What does the focus on name imply in the New Testament?
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.840]   So let me try to answer that in maybe three steps.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.360]   One, the fact that in the Old Testament,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.520]   God went out of His way to make a connection
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.440]   between someone's God-given name
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.320]   and the essentially important thing
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.040]   about that person is significant.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.120]   For example, Genesis 17, five.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.760]   Abram changed to Abraham.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.180]   No longer shall your name be called Abram,
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.840]   but your name shall be Abraham,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.840]   for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.780]   Or Sarai changed to Sarah.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.060]   As for Sarai, your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai,
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.920]   but Sarah shall be her name.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.260]   I will bless her, and moreover,
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.120]   I will give you a son by her, and I will bless her,
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.160]   and she shall become nations.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.160]   And then Jacob changed to Israel.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.760]   God says your name shall no longer be called Jacob,
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.520]   but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.320]   and have prevailed.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.400]   And most importantly is God's own name.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.520]   He names Himself.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.040]   This is one of the most important passages in the Bible,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.680]   I think, Exodus 3, 13 to 14, where Moses says to the,
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.240]   "The people are gonna ask me when I go down there
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.960]   "to deliver them in Egypt, what is God's name?
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.920]   "What shall I tell them?"
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.120]   God says to Moses, "I am who I am."
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.940]   And He said, "Say this to the people.
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.840]   "I am sent me to you."
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.720]   So Yahweh, the name that's used over 600 times
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.000]   for God in the Old Testament,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.120]   it's usually capitalized L-O-R-D in our English versions,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.120]   Yahweh is built on that phrase, I am, I am who I am.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.800]   In other words, every time we read the name of God,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.880]   it's a proper name, Yahweh,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.720]   every time we read the name of God,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.200]   He wants us to remember His essence.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.280]   That's the point.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.960]   When you say my name, remember my essence.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.920]   I absolutely am.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.420]   That's why I gave myself a name with a meaning,
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.440]   a name with a meaning, no beginning, no ending,
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.800]   no becoming, no changing, I absolutely am.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   I am true, I am reliable.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.180]   Every time you say L-O-R-D, all caps, Yahweh,
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.440]   remember that.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.760]   So that's the first observation.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.880]   Second, when the Son of God came into the world
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.160]   as the very presence of God Himself,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.220]   He was given a name, Jesus.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.440]   You shall call His name Jesus
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.800]   because He will save His people from their sins.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.080]   Jesus means Savior.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.520]   He's more, but He's not less.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.920]   You should call His name Emmanuel
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.440]   for it means God with us.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.440]   Call His name Christ
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.600]   because He's the Son of the living God, Matthew 16, 16.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.520]   You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.520]   Philippians 2.10, Jesus replaces the very name of Yahweh
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.640]   from Isaiah 45.23.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.360]   When He quotes that text,
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.940]   Paul puts Jesus' name in there,
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.980]   that every knee will bow to Jesus,
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.600]   where the Old Testament says
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.760]   every knee's gonna bow to Yahweh.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.080]   So boldly, Jesus is saying,
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.700]   I mean, Paul is saying that Jesus is Yahweh
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.760]   and that whatever was true of that name
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.060]   is now true of the name Jesus.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.060]   So just as Jared said in his question at the beginning,
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.160]   the name refers to the essence,
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.880]   the defining reality of the person.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.840]   And you see it repeatedly
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.760]   that the word stands in the place of some defining aspect
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.680]   of the person.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.600]   You see it again and again
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.360]   where the name and the person are interchangeable.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.240]   For example, in Colossians 3.17, it says,
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.640]   whatever you do in word or deed,
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.680]   do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.580]   and then continues like this,
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.700]   giving thanks to the Father through,
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.900]   and instead of saying the name of Jesus again,
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.840]   which could have said, he said through Him.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.060]   So do everything in the name of Jesus,
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.820]   giving thanks to the Father through Him,
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.540]   because Him and the name of the Lord Jesus
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.740]   are interchangeable in that verse.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.900]   So that's observation number two.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.900]   Number three, Jared's real question,
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.680]   my real question is why?
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.280]   We can all see this in the Bible,
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.320]   that the name really matters,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.600]   and the name really stands for the essence.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.520]   And we've adapted our language to that.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.920]   We don't even blink when we pray in Jesus' name
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.140]   or do something in Jesus' name.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.140]   But why this remarkably frequent reference to the name?
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.740]   And here's my effort at an answer,
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.780]   since the Bible doesn't come right out
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.620]   in a theological, systematic way and say,
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.860]   here's the explanation why I use name so many times.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.860]   Try to imagine what would happen if there were no names,
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.660]   if nobody had any names, there's no designations,
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.660]   not even numbers, you don't have a number,
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.260]   you're not like seven, two, three, eight, nine.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.340]   What would we miss if nobody had a name,
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.600]   nobody had a number, nobody had any personal designation?
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.420]   What would we miss?
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.660]   Well, it seems to me we would miss the ease
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.520]   of talking to someone personally.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.020]   How would you get their attention?
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.100]   It's not very personal to say, hey you,
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.500]   and it's hard to say, hey you, so many times.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.680]   And you couldn't endear yourself to anybody in conversation
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.060]   by constantly saying, hey you,
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.680]   and never, never using any personal designation
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.340]   for who they are individually.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.360]   So that's number one, we'd miss that personal way of talking.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.740]   Number two, we would have a hard time talking about someone
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.000]   if we wanted to say, discuss them in hiring.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.040]   I don't mean talking about them in any kind of gossipy way,
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.020]   I just mean normally talking in a positive way
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.000]   about somebody, we couldn't even name them.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.940]   How would we even know who we're talking about
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.540]   if we couldn't name somebody?
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.900]   So talking about them, say even to praise them,
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.880]   which is number three, we would have a hard time
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.700]   singing anybody's praises if we couldn't ever name them.
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.780]   So without names, all of this collapses,
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.120]   all this relational communication collapses,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.700]   and God knew that, and he began the world by naming things.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.180]   Then after God named things, Adam named things.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.420]   He named all the animals, he gave his wife a name,
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.060]   and that makes communication possible.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.660]   And early on, God gave names that corresponded
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.140]   to something important that a person had or would have,
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.360]   which, by the way, just a little passing comment here,
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.540]   I would just encourage parents to think hard
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.460]   when they name their children to give them names
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.900]   that have meaning that they can grow into.
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.180]   Don't just think, oh, that's a cool sound.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.060]   Surely life is more than a cool sound.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.260]   Okay, close that parenthesis.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.820]   That's another APJ, another time.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.860]   So here's the implication.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.860]   Referring to the name of Jesus so often is a way of saying
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:48.740]   this person is not to be dealt with in private.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:53.820]   He is not to be hidden, a hidden essence in your heart
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.500]   or in your closet.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.140]   He is to be public, globally known,
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.740]   acknowledged as a person with an identity
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.340]   that people talk to and people talk about,
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.860]   that people praise and sing about.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.980]   The emphasis on his name goes with an emphasis
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.980]   on his public, outward, global claim on people's attention.
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.820]   Romans 1:5, "We have apostleship to bring about
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.500]   "the obedience of faith for the sake of his name
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.380]   "among all the nations."
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.980]   Romans 9:17, "That my name might be proclaimed
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.300]   "in all the earth."
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.620]   Romans 15, 19, "Therefore I will praise you
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.340]   "among the Gentiles and sing to your name."
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.000]   Romans 10, 13, "For everyone who calls upon
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.600]   "the name of the Lord will be saved."
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.020]   So one way to think about it is that the name of Jesus
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.820]   goes hand in hand with the fame of Jesus.
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.460]   I think that might be the shorthand way
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.060]   to remember what I'm trying to say,
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.260]   that the name of Jesus goes hand in hand
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.820]   with the fame of Jesus.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.700]   A name is a way of communicating with
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.520]   and a way of communicating about all over the world
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.700]   who you're talking about.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.220]   And Jesus exists to be known.
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:21.220]   He exists to be addressed and praised all over the world.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.460]   The word name calls attention repeatedly
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.460]   to the public verbal goal of his fame.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.820]   - That's really good.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.320]   So the name of Christ has no magical power in itself
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.180]   like some incantation.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.000]   - I don't think so.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.300]   I don't think there's anything magical about it.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.220]   - Yeah, and I think the seven sons of Sceva
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.300]   found that out the hard way.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.100]   - Yeah, that would be a good illustration.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.020]   I know Paul, I know Jesus, who are you?
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.300]   - Oh, yeah, don't wheel that name around
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.340]   if you don't know what it means.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.260]   And thank you for listening along
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.100]   and for subscribing to Ask Pastor John
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.900]   in your favorite podcast app or in YouTube.
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.500]   Next time we will look at asexuality
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.100]   of people who experience no general
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.600]   sexual attraction to others.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.620]   Is this a sure sign of the permanent gift
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.700]   of singleness or not?
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.900]   Could this change?
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.820]   It's a really good question.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.340]   Up next on the other side of the weekend,
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.620]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.820]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:31.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
