[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.340]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.400]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.900]   Today, we are discussing working memory.
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.620]   Working memory is a special category of memory
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.560]   in which we are able to hold small amounts of information
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.120]   in our mind for short periods of time.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.280]   Working memory is also very closely related to attention.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.860]   So for any of you that are interested
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.000]   in how to develop better focus and attention,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.840]   understanding what working memory is
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.360]   and some of the things that you can do
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.540]   to improve your working memory can be very beneficial.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.240]   Today, I'm going to talk about what working memory is,
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.280]   including some of the underlying biology,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.720]   although I promise,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.120]   irrespective of whether or not you know any biology
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.300]   or you are an expert in biology,
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.860]   I'll make the conversation accessible to you.
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.680]   In addition, I will talk about tools
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.280]   to improve working memory,
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.160]   and I'll also compare working memory to other forms of memory
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.180]   like long-term memory and short-term memory.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.320]   And through that understanding,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.600]   I'm confident that you'll be able to develop better focus
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.060]   as well as be able to commit certain forms of information
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.640]   to your short and long-term memory stores.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.480]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.220]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.360]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.240]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.280]   about science and science-related tools
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.740]   to the general public.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.840]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.760]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.600]   Our first sponsor is Matina.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.980]   Matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink Yerba Mate.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.040]   I often discuss Yerba Mate's benefits,
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.580]   such as regulating blood sugar,
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.020]   its high antioxidant content,
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.300]   the ways that it can improve digestion,
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.500]   and possible neuroprotective effects.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.100]   I also drink Yerba Mate because I love the taste.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.480]   While there are a lot of different choices
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.500]   of Yerba Mate drinks out there,
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.720]   I love Matina because, again, they have the no sugar variety
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.960]   as well as the fact that both their loose leaf
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.000]   and their canned varieties are of the absolute best quality.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.840]   So much so that I decided to become a partial owner
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.800]   in the company.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.160]   Although I must say,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.460]   even if they hadn't allowed me to do that,
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.840]   I would be drinking Matina.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.640]   It is the cleanest tasting and best Yerba Mate you can find.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.920]   I love the taste of brewed loose leaf Matina Yerba Mate,
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.520]   and I particularly love the taste of Matina's new
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.840]   canned cold brew zero sugar Yerba Mate,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.600]   which I personally help them develop.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.100]   If you'd like to try Matina,
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.580]   go to www.drinkmatina.com/huberman.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.240]   Right now Matina is offering a free one pound bag
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.300]   of loose leaf Yerba Mate tea and free shipping
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.720]   with the purchase of two cases
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.560]   of their cold brew Yerba Mate.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.000]   Again, that's www.drinkmatina.com/huberman
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.640]   to get the free bag of Yerba Mate loose leaf tea
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.960]   and free shipping.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.060]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.840]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.760]   with a licensed therapist carried out online.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.480]   - I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.920]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.380]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.960]   but pretty soon I realized
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.800]   that therapy is extremely valuable.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.100]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.840]   just as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.160]   including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training,
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.240]   which of course I also do every week.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.200]   The reason I know therapy is so valuable
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.960]   is that if you can find a therapist
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.560]   with whom you can develop a really good rapport,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.840]   you not only get terrific support
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.800]   for some of the challenges in your life,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.400]   but you also can derive tremendous insights
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.520]   from that therapy.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.300]   Insights that can allow you to better
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.960]   not just your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.240]   but of course also the relationship to yourself
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.840]   and to your professional life,
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.560]   to all sorts of career goals.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.820]   In fact, I see therapy as one of the key components
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.520]   for meshing together all aspects of one's life
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.400]   and being able to really direct one's focus and attention
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.120]   toward what really matters.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.320]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.800]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.460]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.440]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.680]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.080]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.680]   I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.020]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.960]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.640]   is to make sure that your mattress
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.520]   matches your sleep requirements.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.380]   The Helix website has a brief two-minute quiz
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.220]   that if you go to it,
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.460]   we'll ask you questions such as do you sleep on your back,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.420]   your side, or your stomach?
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.740]   Do you tend to run hot or cold
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.860]   during the middle of the night?
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.700]   As well as some other questions that allow you
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.140]   to determine the optimal mattress for you.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.980]   When I took the quiz,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.420]   I personally matched to their Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.120]   which has allowed me to significantly improve my sleep.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.100]   So if you're interested
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.140]   in significantly improving your sleep,
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.300]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.800]   Take their brief two-minute quiz
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.040]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.520]   And you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.800]   and two free pillows.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.240]   So again, if you're interested in trying Helix,
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.880]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.740]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.960]   Okay, let's talk about working memory.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.620]   And let's start off this discussion
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.640]   by comparing working memory to other forms of memory
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.340]   that most people are more familiar with.
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.120]   Or at least when most people hear the word memory,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.720]   they typically are thinking about long-term memory,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.820]   like one's ability to remember the capitals of states
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.040]   or countries, the different continents,
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.800]   directions from one location to another, even one's name.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.920]   All of those things are examples of long-term memory.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.880]   Now I want to emphasize that long-term memory
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.720]   really has two components.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.640]   There are what we call declarative long-term memories.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.520]   So these are the things that we can declare,
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.840]   things like facts about ourselves or the world or others.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.800]   And then there are procedural long-term memories.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.620]   Procedural long-term memories, as the name suggests,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.560]   are aspects of our memory that allow us
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.360]   to perform certain procedures.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.960]   They are literally action steps that we take
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.700]   to, for instance, ride a bicycle or drive a car,
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.220]   which, by the way, we might not be conscious
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.160]   of ourselves doing after we learn,
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.520]   that is, after we pass information
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.260]   into our procedural long-term memory.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.580]   But even once those things become reflexive,
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.740]   they are stored in our long-term memory.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.200]   Now, a discussion of long-term memory
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.920]   is not the focus today, but me being a neuroscientist,
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.280]   and I like to think you all generally being interested
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.520]   in the underlying biology,
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.980]   I'll just mention that there is a key structure
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.160]   within the brain that is part of a larger neural network
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.420]   that is a collection of structures,
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.940]   which is absolutely essential for the formation
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.500]   and storage of long-term memories.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.940]   And that's the hippocampus, which in Latin means seahorse.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.060]   And it does look a little bit like a seahorse,
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.440]   but we actually have one on each side of your brain,
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.460]   so we say hippocampi, plural.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.100]   And so what we know is that if people have damage
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.080]   to their hippocampus of any kind,
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.340]   that people have trouble accessing
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.220]   or forming long-term memory, sometimes both.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.960]   And there's a lot more that we could say
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.880]   about long-term memory.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.020]   Indeed, I did an entire episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.460]   about the formation and storage of long-term memories,
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.760]   including some tools to improve long-term memory.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.980]   We'll touch on a few of those tools later today,
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.760]   but you can access that episode
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.080]   if you go to HubermanLab.com and just put memory
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.480]   into the search function and you'll find it there.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.400]   In the meantime, if we want to understand working memory,
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.700]   we not only have to understand
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.740]   how it's different from long-term memory,
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.460]   but also how it's different from short-term memories.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.620]   Short-term memory is a capacity that we all have
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.940]   that, as the name suggests,
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.080]   represents a short-term memory bank for information
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.840]   that may or may not get passed into long-term memory.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.640]   So for instance, if you've learned anything,
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.620]   and of course you have,
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.120]   if you can understand what I'm saying,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.220]   you've learned English language.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.760]   If you can write, you've learned how to write, et cetera.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.020]   Well, in order to learn those things
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.420]   and to commit them to long-term memory,
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.700]   the information required to do those things
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.300]   and to have that knowledge
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.620]   needed to be held in short-term memory.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.460]   And short-term memories are the sorts of memories
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.200]   that we maintain for somewhere between a few minutes
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.440]   and potentially a few hours, maybe a little bit longer,
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.200]   but only a certain percentage of that
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.040]   is passed into our long-term memory.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.320]   So for instance, if you listen to this podcast
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.720]   or you go to a course lecture,
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.400]   whether or not that lecture is about cognitive material
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.340]   or whether or not it's about learning a new physical skill,
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.560]   regardless of what you learn,
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.600]   you're only going to learn
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.840]   a certain amount of that information.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.820]   But were we to examine
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.640]   how much of the information you just heard
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.900]   or that you're hearing now,
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.680]   you remember immediately after this podcast episode,
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.800]   as compared to say a week later,
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.200]   we know based on, gosh,
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.720]   probably millions of scientific papers and studies,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.980]   that you are going to have more information
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.640]   in your short-term memory stores
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.860]   shortly after being exposed to new information
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.220]   than you will later.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.880]   In other words, only a small percentage of what we perceive,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.120]   what we see, what we hear, et cetera,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.880]   gets passed into short-term memory.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.600]   And then only a fraction of that
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.520]   gets passed into long-term memory.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.940]   Now, the neural circuits for short-term memory
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.040]   and the passage of short-term memories into long-term memory
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.700]   involve a lot of different brain structures.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.820]   But here again, we can implicate the hippocampus
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.720]   because the actual passage of short-term memories
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.480]   into long-term memories
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.520]   occurs in part within the hippocampus.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.840]   And then, a lot of people don't know this,
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.740]   some of the memories that we think of as long-term memories
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.900]   are actually distributed into the neocortex,
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.120]   which is the outer portion of the brain.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.340]   Now, the point here is less to fill your mind
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.700]   with different names of things and nomenclature,
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.940]   but rather to get you thinking about
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.000]   what's involved in creating short and long-term memories.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.480]   And equally important,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.200]   that even though the hippocampus is critically involved
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.440]   in the formation of short and long-term memories,
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.760]   that the formation of short and long-term memories
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.540]   is really a network phenomenon.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.240]   In fact, among the more important themes
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.520]   that comes up again and again on this podcast,
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.640]   anytime that we're talking about neuroscience,
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.980]   or actually biology in any case,
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.120]   is that rarely, if ever,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.560]   is there one location in the brain where something happens.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.260]   Typically, it's a network phenomenon,
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.600]   meaning it's the collaboration
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.200]   of a bunch of different brain areas,
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.760]   passing information from one location to the next
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.660]   and storing it in a kind of distributed way.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.980]   Now, another key thing to understand about working memory
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.100]   and how it is different from short and long-term memory
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.340]   is that the formation of short and long-term memories
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.640]   almost always involves neuroplasticity.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.980]   Neuroplasticity is the nervous system's ability to change
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.820]   in response to experience.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.420]   Now, there are different types of neuroplasticity.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.760]   So often when we hear about neuroplasticity
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.320]   in the popular sphere,
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.780]   people don't emphasize that there are different types
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.700]   of neuroplasticity,
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.380]   and it's worth paying a little bit of attention
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.460]   to what those different types are.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.200]   There is, for instance, what we call long-term potentiation.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.140]   Long-term potentiation, or LTP, as the acronym goes,
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.380]   is the strengthening of connections between neurons
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.740]   as a consequence of their repeated firing
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.220]   very closely together in time.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.860]   Okay, there's a lot more to it,
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.460]   but if you've ever heard the phrase
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.500]   fire together, wire together,
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.580]   sometimes that is misattributed to Donald Hebb,
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.340]   who did talk about neuroplasticity.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.820]   By the way, Donald Hebb was a psychologist up in Canada
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.820]   who talked about neuroplasticity in the context
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.700]   of lots of different forms of learning,
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.620]   but that fire together, wire together phrase
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.580]   was not actually stated by Donald Hebb.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.660]   It was stated by Carla Schatz, my colleague at Stanford,
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.560]   and she was referring to LTP,
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.420]   but other forms of neuroplasticity
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.340]   that occur mainly in development
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.980]   when neurons fire very closely in time
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.040]   and thereby strengthen those connections,
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.380]   which can include LTP, okay?
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.980]   So for now, think of LTP as any time
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.540]   that some small group of neurons, could be two neurons,
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.780]   could be 2,000 neurons,
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.260]   are very active closely together in time,
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.380]   and they have access to one another physically,
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.640]   and the consequence is often, not always, but is often LTP.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.100]   That is the strengthening of those connections
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.340]   such that after that barrage of activity subsides,
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.280]   those neurons can speak to each other.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.280]   They can communicate through electrical activity
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.980]   and chemical activity much more easily.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.740]   Their communication is more robust.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.740]   It's like removing a wall between a conversation
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.500]   such that the conversation can take place more fluidly.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.340]   Now, there are other forms of neuroplasticity,
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.260]   including LTD, long-term depression,
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.100]   which unfortunately the name often calls to mind
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.620]   ideas about depression as a psychiatric
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.860]   or a psychological symptom,
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.200]   but it has nothing to do with that.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.120]   Long-term depression is simply the inverse of LTP.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.880]   It's actually the weakening or the removal of connections
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.220]   that we call synapses between neurons.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.420]   I want to emphasize that both LTP and LTD
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.320]   are both critically involved
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.300]   in lots of different kinds of learning,
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.720]   and both of them tend to be involved in the formation
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.220]   of both short-term memories and long-term memories.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.540]   And this is very important in the removal
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.980]   of short-term memories and long-term memories,
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.960]   literally forgetting of certain things,
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.180]   because as we all know,
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.420]   there are many things that we will never forget,
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.240]   and there are also things that we almost always forget.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.060]   Now, there's a third form of neuroplasticity
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.220]   that's involved in the formation
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.460]   of short and long-term memories
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.840]   that's important for us to discuss just briefly.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.780]   But I do want to emphasize
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.780]   that there are not just three forms of neuroplasticity.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.300]   There are many other forms, dozens, if not more,
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.620]   things like spike timing-dependent plasticity,
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.080]   paired pulse facilitation, and on and on.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.680]   But the third type of neuroplasticity
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.560]   that I'd like to mention now is neurogenesis.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.040]   Neurogenesis is the formation of new neurons.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.140]   Now, neurogenesis is robust
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.420]   in the developing nervous system.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.260]   We know this.
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.120]   Neurogenesis is robust in the developing nervous system
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.520]   of animals and humans.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.500]   However, neurogenesis,
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.140]   the literal formation of new neurons in the brain,
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.040]   is a very exciting idea, and it does occur.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.400]   And it's very exciting in a way
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.660]   that has motivated lots of popular press outlets
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.100]   to talk about or to discuss papers
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.180]   that have discovered neurogenesis in the adult brain.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.820]   Because let's be honest,
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.140]   what's more exciting than the idea
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.100]   that your brain can add new brain cells later in life?
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.740]   And indeed, that has been shown,
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.280]   even in people well into their 80s and 90s.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.700]   However, it's very important to know
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.280]   that the total amount of neurogenesis that occurs
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   in the adult human brain is infinitesimally small
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.240]   as a mechanism for neuroplasticity and learning
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.200]   as compared to the other forms of neuroplasticity
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.040]   that we discussed,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.220]   such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.720]   So I don't want to throw cold water
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.220]   on the topic of neurogenesis.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.700]   It's an incredibly interesting and important topic,
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.320]   but all too often they tend to eclipse
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.840]   the much more common mechanism
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.220]   for the formation of short and long-term memories,
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.920]   which are those other forms we just talked about,
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.580]   LTP, LTD, et cetera.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.460]   So the point here is that, yes, indeed,
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.800]   there are new neurons that can be added in the adult brain,
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.640]   maybe even in the adult human brain.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.300]   And there is some evidence that some of those new neurons
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.660]   are added to the hippocampus.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.980]   In fact, a particular region of the hippocampus
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.240]   called the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.680]   And there's been a lot of controversy
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.500]   about how much neurogenesis occurs or doesn't occur
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.500]   and whether or not it occurs after puberty or not.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.800]   There's a whole field of people battling over this,
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.260]   now for several decades.
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.180]   But one thing is very clear.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.800]   Neurogenesis, while it's very exciting and intriguing,
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.360]   is not the main mechanism by which the formation
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.360]   of short and long-term memories occurs.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.820]   When you learn new information, as you are right now,
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.240]   the storage of that information
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.280]   in your short-term memory networks,
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.200]   which is then passed on to your long-term memory networks,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.120]   and that can be recalled,
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.760]   that allows you to state certain facts about,
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.120]   for instance, the existence of this thing
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.960]   called a hippocampus.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.920]   Hopefully you will remember that going forward.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.520]   Or your ability to perform any kind of motor movement
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.720]   that you learned now or way back in childhood.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.320]   Most of that is the consequence of the strengthening
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   of particular connections
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.740]   and the weakening of other types of connections.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.520]   Those are the two major forms of neuroplasticity.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.920]   Okay, so I don't want you to get the impression
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.620]   that there's something wrong with my memory
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.120]   and that I forgot that this episode
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.880]   is not about short or long-term memory,
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.440]   but it's about working memory.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.380]   And indeed, I have not forgotten.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.800]   So now is where I tell you why I've been talking
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   about short and long-term memory and the mechanisms of those
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.960]   because I want them to provide a stark contrast
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.480]   for what we call working memory.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.980]   Working memory, as far as we know,
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.480]   does not involve neuroplasticity, or at least if it does,
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.120]   it's not a particularly robust aspect of working memory.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.080]   Rather, working memory is the reflection
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.680]   of a particular neural circuit
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.060]   running an algorithm over and over and over
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.900]   for different types of information,
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.880]   but the information isn't stored,
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.900]   it is actually intentionally discarded.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.600]   Now, what sorts of daily activities and life activities
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.320]   would require working memory?
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.080]   The answer to that is basically everything
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.440]   that you need to do, but that you don't want to remember.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.960]   Now, what types of things would those be?
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.280]   Well, let's think about it.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.480]   Most all of us learned at some point in our life
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.800]   to tie our own shoes.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.680]   Presumably, you know how to tie your own shoes.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.920]   If you don't, perhaps you should learn
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.820]   or wear Velcro or slippers, I don't know,
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.760]   but assuming you can tie your own shoes,
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.340]   that's something that you know how to do
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.080]   and you can do it as a procedural long-term memory.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.320]   You can do that action.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.320]   You don't have to think about it too much.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.800]   Working memory would come into play
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.880]   when say you wake up in the morning
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.880]   and you know that you need to head out for a jog,
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.200]   but you also need to make a cup of coffee first
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.840]   and you need to remember where the coffee is,
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.920]   where your shoes are,
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.800]   and perhaps you're making a phone call
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.900]   or you're having a conversation
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.040]   while you need to tie your shoes and so on and so forth.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.440]   Working memory is basically the taking in of information
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.400]   that's critical for you to sequence your actions
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.440]   over a short period of time and then forget that sequence.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.420]   For instance, I'm willing to bet
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.400]   that you put your shoes on to go running
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.720]   before you go running.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.000]   That's sort of a duh.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.480]   And if you're like me, you drink your water, your coffee,
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.600]   your Yerba Mate before you go running.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.400]   The point here is that if you wake up in the morning
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.800]   and you like caffeine before you go for a run,
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.560]   there are certain series of action steps
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.360]   that you need to carry out to hydrate,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.480]   make that cup of coffee or tea,
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.680]   drink it, put on your shoes, head out the door.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   You need to sequence things properly,
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.440]   but you don't want to commit your long-term
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.600]   or even your short-term memory stores
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.520]   to carrying out that sequence.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.720]   You simply want to be able to carry out that sequence
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.120]   and then discard that information about the sequence
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.320]   and focus your attention on, for instance,
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.460]   what trajectory you're going to run through the park
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.240]   or around your neighborhood.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.880]   Then you want to discard that information
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.880]   and you want to lean into the next portion of your day
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.800]   and so on and so on.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.480]   In fact, working memory is involved
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.560]   in essentially every activity, both cognitive and motor
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.240]   from the point you wake up in the morning
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.520]   until the time you go to sleep at night
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.280]   for every single day of your life.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.200]   And we know this because there are indeed people
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   who have diminished working memory
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.140]   or even lack working memory entirely,
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.320]   although the latter is somewhat rare, it has happened.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.240]   And as you can imagine, they have a complete failure
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.400]   of ability to sequence activities
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.200]   and their lives are extremely difficult.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.000]   They need a ton of assistance from other people,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   even more assistance than do people
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.360]   who have minimal or no long-term memory, okay?
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.960]   So this is really highlighting
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.100]   just how important working memory is.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.920]   Working memory is basically the way
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.320]   that you navigate any immediate environment.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.480]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.520]   it's very closely tied to attention
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.640]   because in order to know what to do now
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.200]   and then what to do subsequently
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   and then subsequent to that,
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.320]   you need to be able to hold your attention
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.480]   to the things you need to do.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.400]   So working memory and attention collaborate
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.040]   literally at a neural circuit level
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.760]   and at a neurochemical level
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.120]   in order to allow you to move through your day
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.360]   in an adaptive, functional way.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.520]   And people who have challenges with attention or focus
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.360]   or working memory, and sometimes it can be hard
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.940]   to dissociate which one they're having challenges with,
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.020]   really have a hard time moving through life
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.860]   as compared to people whose attention
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.720]   and working memory is more robust.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   Now, the good news is today,
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.000]   we're going to talk about working memory,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.640]   some of the neural circuits involved
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.920]   and some of the neurochemicals involved
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.440]   that can augment or improve working memory.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.280]   And we're also going to talk about what one can do
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.320]   to directly increase the amount of neurotransmission
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.520]   of those particular chemicals within the circuits
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.760]   that control working memory.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.060]   In other words, to improve your working memory.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.640]   Now, I can talk about working memory
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.720]   and the mechanisms, et cetera, all day long.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.000]   But as is often the case, sometimes it's better
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.040]   to not just learn about concepts,
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   but actually to experience them in real time.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.240]   So what we're going to do now
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.640]   is I'm actually going to give you a working memory test.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.860]   This is the sort of working memory test that you would take
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.780]   if you were to go into a psychology laboratory
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.240]   or a neuroscience laboratory
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.040]   and they were studying working memory in humans.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.600]   Now, there's another advantage to us doing this in real time
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.460]   right here as you're listening
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.240]   or as you're listening and watching.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.160]   And that's because you're going to get data.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.540]   You're going to get information
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.680]   about what your baseline working memory capacity is.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.120]   And you're going to want to keep those data
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.960]   in your short-term memory stores,
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.600]   maybe even your long-term memory stores,
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.280]   but certainly your short-term memory stores
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.760]   because shortly later in this episode,
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.960]   I'm going to talk about different ways
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.320]   to improve your working memory
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.720]   depending on where your baseline working memory starts,
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.320]   which by the way, turns out to be a pretty good proxy
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.280]   for the levels of a neuromodulator called dopamine
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.640]   within the neural circuits that control working memory.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.620]   So right now, let's take a working memory task.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.880]   We're going to do this purely through audio form
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.360]   because I realize some people are watching
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.680]   and listening to this on YouTube
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.060]   and others are just listening to this episode.
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.960]   So there are not going to be any visual cues
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.640]   or slides that I present.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.800]   And that's perhaps what distinguishes what we're about to do
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.640]   most from what would happen in a laboratory.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.760]   Typically in a laboratory,
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.760]   there would be some visual presentation
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.120]   of what I'm about to say.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.680]   But here, because of the format
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.740]   that most of you are consuming this information by,
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.300]   we're going to do this purely by audio.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.260]   So the first test of your working memory is very simple.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.800]   I'm going to read off a series of letters.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.160]   And your task is to remember
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.960]   as many of those letters as you can.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.360]   The first string of letters is J, K, Z, P, I.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.600]   Okay, just to make this really easy,
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.080]   I'm going to say it twice.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.320]   Although typically in a working memory task,
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.380]   it would just be said once,
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.000]   but I'm going to make this extra easy.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.840]   J, K, Z, P, I.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.400]   Okay, now you in your own head
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.640]   can try and recite back those letters if you like.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.640]   Okay, second string of letters, R, O, M, K, L, E.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:37.320]   I'm going to make this extra simple and do it again.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.920]   Not typical for a working memory task,
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.500]   but there are some working memory tasks where that happens.
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.740]   R, O, M, K, L, E.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.120]   Okay, now a third string of letters.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.020]   This one's going to be a little bit longer.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.640]   So cue up that working memory and attention.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.560]   W, A, C, Q, V, D, N.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.020]   I'll repeat that again.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.920]   W, A, C, Q, V, D, N.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.720]   How many of the letters I just read can you remember?
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.960]   Okay, so depending on how many letters you can remember,
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.140]   perhaps you have a low, moderate,
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.280]   or high degree of working memory.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.420]   Keep in mind that some of you are perhaps
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.760]   doing other things, you're attending to driving
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.120]   or other tasks within your home or your office.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.520]   And so perhaps you weren't able to pay full attention.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.480]   So there'll be some variation there.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.320]   But nonetheless,
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.960]   after reading each of those strings of letters,
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.720]   you were asked to recall those letters in your mind.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.800]   And if you wrote them down and you're rereading them,
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.640]   yes, that's cheating.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.480]   But how about this?
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.420]   What if I were to ask you now
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.060]   about the simplest first string of letters,
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.580]   the one that consisted of only five letters?
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.140]   How many of you can remember any of those five letters now?
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:58.460]   Okay, I can't hear you if you're shouting them out.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.340]   I can't see you if you're raising your hand.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.380]   But chances are most of you have forgotten
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.700]   the first series of letters,
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.920]   even though it was quite short
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.140]   and you could remember it early on.
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.380]   That ability to remember that string of letters
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.660]   when you first heard them, and indeed I read them twice.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.220]   So I'd be very surprised if any of you
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.540]   couldn't remember that string of letters
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.020]   after hearing them twice.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:21.140]   But I also read you some other letters in the interim, okay?
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.380]   So that now, just a couple minutes later,
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.420]   I'm asking you to remember
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.260]   that first string of five letters.
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.900]   And assuming that you didn't write it down
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.120]   and you're not cheating,
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.320]   chances are you remember anywhere from two to zero
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.740]   of those letters in that first word,
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.860]   which is a perfect example of your working memory.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.940]   Nothing got committed to short-term,
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.960]   much less long-term memory.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.340]   Rather, your working memory
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.420]   was able to work with that information
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.460]   and hold it in mind for just as long
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.580]   as you thought you needed to know that information,
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:54.220]   but then, thank goodness, that information was discarded.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.680]   You didn't know that I was gonna ask you
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.740]   for that first string of letters,
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.160]   again, after reading you the longer string of letters,
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.520]   but I did that deliberately
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.060]   to show you how your working memory works.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.140]   So in some sense, the working memory task is a bit unusual
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.460]   in that it's a test of, yes, memory
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.500]   in the very, very short term,
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.020]   but also a test of your ability to forget,
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.500]   to discard information that's not critical.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.540]   And that gets us back
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.460]   to the original definition of working memory,
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.180]   which is our ability to attend
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.900]   to specific small batches of information,
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.180]   remember it for just as long as we think we need to,
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.180]   and then to discard that information.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.380]   And by the way, if you want to know
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.380]   what those first five letters were, they were J-K-Z-P-I.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.380]   I'd like to take a brief moment
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.340]   and thank one of our sponsors, and that's AG1.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.960]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.260]   that also contains adaptogens.
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.380]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.620]   The reason I started taking it,
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.420]   and the reason I still take it every day,
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.780]   is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.560]   for vitamins and minerals,
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.420]   and it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.940]   to support gut health.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.400]   Now, gut health is something that over the last 10 years,
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.380]   we realized is not just important
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.200]   for the health of our gut, but also for our immune system,
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.380]   and for the production of neurotransmitters
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.920]   and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin,
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.900]   in other words, gut health is critical
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.760]   for proper brain functioning.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.440]   Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.860]   for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.820]   but there are a number of things in AG1,
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.520]   including specific micronutrients
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.080]   that are hard to get from whole foods,
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.960]   or at least in sufficient quantities.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.380]   So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.140]   that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens,
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.180]   and critical micronutrients.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.740]   So anytime somebody asks me
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.860]   if they were to take just one supplement,
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.460]   what that supplement should be,
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.140]   I tell them AG1, because AG1 supports
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.260]   so many different systems within the body
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.500]   that are involved in mental health,
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.120]   physical health, and performance.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.020]   To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman,
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.160]   and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.260]   and five free travel packs of AG1.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.120]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.540]   So now's where we talk a little bit about
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.200]   the neural circuitry and the neurochemistry
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.580]   of working memory.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.100]   Now, it's important that we do this,
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.500]   because in a few minutes, you're also going to learn
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.500]   that people generally fall into two broad bins
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.660]   of having a high or low baseline
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.600]   of a certain neurochemical in the brain
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.340]   that affords them either high or low
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.820]   working memory capacity.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.860]   Now, in reality, it's a distribution.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.180]   In fact, it's what we call a normal distribution.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.320]   So it really isn't two bins.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.500]   But during today's discussion,
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.460]   and in fact, in a lot of laboratory studies,
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.540]   we can actually bin people into these two groups.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.700]   The neural circuitry underlying working memory
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.900]   involves a lot of different brain locations,
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.260]   that is, a lot of different neural networks
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.740]   collaborating to create this thing we call working memory.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.740]   However, there are a couple of key hubs,
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.180]   that is, locations within the brain,
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.620]   that are especially important for working memory.
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.820]   The ones that I'd like to focus on today
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.800]   involve the prefrontal cortex.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.420]   So this is neural real estate
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.540]   that resides just behind the forehead.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.500]   And the neurons in the brainstem,
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.100]   so further back in the brain,
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.720]   that manufacture dopamine and that send their little wires
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.260]   that we call axons up to the prefrontal cortex
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.860]   to release dopamine.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.340]   Dopamine is a neuromodulator.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.380]   Many people are familiar with dopamine
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:25.340]   and familiar with it in the context of motivation and drive.
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.020]   Sometimes people mistakenly think
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.620]   it's only involved in pleasure,
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.940]   but dopamine is involved in motivation and drive.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.180]   When dopamine systems go awry,
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.220]   that is, if their levels get too high,
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.760]   that can create manic states,
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.900]   it can create addictive states.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.540]   When dopamine levels are too low,
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.700]   you can get movement challenges such as in Parkinson's,
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.840]   which is a deficit or a literal destruction of the neurons
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.340]   that manufacture dopamine.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.280]   There are a bunch of different areas of the brain
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.840]   that those dopamine neurons in the brainstem project to.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.600]   But for right now, we're going to focus almost entirely
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.060]   on the dopamine projections from the brainstem
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.700]   to the prefrontal cortex,
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.100]   which is called the mesocortical circuitry.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.560]   I'm not going to get into the origins
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.360]   or the meaning of the mesocortical
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.360]   versus other dopamine projection systems.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.880]   I did that in a couple of episodes
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.260]   about ADHD and attention and dopamine in particular.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.340]   And you can find those at hubermanlab.com.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.580]   Just put dopamine and circuits into the search function
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.380]   and it will take you to those particular timestamps
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.420]   where I described that.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.340]   But since we want to keep things fairly top contour
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.340]   at the level of neural circuitry here,
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.680]   just know that there are a bunch of neurons
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.540]   that manufacture dopamine back in the brainstem
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.460]   that send their axons, those little wires,
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.780]   up to the prefrontal cortex,
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:39.780]   and that the amount of dopamine released per unit time,
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.520]   so in a certain amount of time,
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.680]   strongly dictates the extent to which
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.480]   working memory capacity is going to be high, medium, or low.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.500]   Now, I want to be very clear
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.200]   because I'm going to come back to this
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.380]   a little bit later again and again.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:30:00.020]   It is the case that when dopamine levels are lower,
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.820]   that is either there are fewer neurons
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.600]   that have the potential to release dopamine
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.760]   in the frontal cortex, or for whatever reason,
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.020]   less is being released in the frontal cortex,
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.700]   that working memory performance tends to be lower
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.220]   as compared to conditions where dopamine release
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.640]   or the availability of dopamine is higher.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.440]   However, it is not the case that more dopamine
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.720]   is always going to equate to improved working memory.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.040]   This is so important that I'm going to say it again.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.420]   It is not always the case that increasing
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.220]   the amount of dopamine transmission in the frontal cortex
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.100]   leads to improvements in working memory.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.500]   There is a specific criteria that allows us to predict
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.200]   whether or not it will improve or maintain
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.020]   or actually degrade working memory performance.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.880]   So before you head to the end of the podcast
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.800]   to try and figure out ways to increase dopamine
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.400]   to improve working memory, please keep that fact in mind.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.700]   Don't just commit it to your working memory,
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.580]   commit it to your short and long-term memory
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.840]   because that's very important
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.100]   if your goal is to improve your working memory.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.940]   With that said, I do want to describe
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.880]   just a little bit of research showing the relationship
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.340]   between having a low working memory span, as it's called,
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.980]   the ability to only remember a few letters or numbers
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.900]   or short batches of information
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.380]   as compared to a high working memory span,
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.220]   meaning longer strings of letters,
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.580]   longer strings of numbers,
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.340]   which of course in the real world translates
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.980]   to being able to carry out shorter
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.460]   versus longer action sequences as described earlier
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.820]   in the scenario where you're getting up in the morning
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.700]   and you're making coffee and you're heading out for a run,
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.540]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.500]   People do differ in terms of their working memory capacity
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.640]   and there's a classic study done by Kules
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.040]   and Desposito and colleagues, this was published in 2008,
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.600]   where they had a way to label the amount of dopamine
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.900]   that is available for release in the frontal cortex
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.880]   in human subjects.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.580]   They did this by the injection of a specific dye.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.020]   That dye gets taken up specifically by the neurons
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.720]   in the brain that manufactured dopamine.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.680]   Then they were able to image the brains of those people
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.360]   while those people were wide awake
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.940]   using something called positron emission tomography.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.400]   Again, the specific tool isn't necessarily important,
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.200]   but since some of you like to know,
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.540]   and what they found is that for people
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.580]   that had a high working memory span,
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:10.000]   that is could remember long strings of numbers or letters
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.560]   or other information,
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.880]   they tended to be the people that had more dopamine
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.120]   available for release in the frontal cortex,
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.440]   either because they had more of the dopamine neurons
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.740]   themselves or similar number of neurons,
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.480]   but those neurons had more dopamine to release, okay?
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.860]   And they also found the converse.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.400]   Individuals that had a low working memory span and ability
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.940]   had less dopamine available for release.
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.580]   So that establishes a correlation, but it's not causal.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.940]   A different study, which is also a classic,
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:45.420]   was carried out by Brzozki, Brown, Rosvold, and Goldman.
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.340]   And this is a really important study
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.180]   because in this study,
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.380]   they were able to introduce small amounts of dopamine
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.560]   directly into the cortex
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.320]   and evaluate working memory capacity.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.640]   Now, anytime a working memory test is done,
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.500]   the same pattern always emerges.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.280]   This is regardless of any dopamine
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.360]   being infused into the brain,
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.760]   which is people and animals for that matter
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.040]   are very good at remembering short spans of numbers,
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.720]   letters, or other types of information.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.840]   So if you tell them one thing, like the letter A,
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.260]   and then you ask them, do you remember the letter?
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.440]   Almost everybody remembers that,
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.500]   but if you give them a string of 10 letters,
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.320]   they remember fewer of those 10 letters.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.740]   That's sort of obvious,
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.320]   but it's an important point to emphasize nonetheless.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:29.280]   And so there's a kind of a dropping off curve of performance
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.540]   as one progresses from fewer to greater number of items
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.840]   to be remembered.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.600]   In this study, when dopamine was introduced
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.460]   to the frontal cortex,
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.280]   the number of things that individuals could remember
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.960]   simply increased.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   It was a very straightforward result.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.640]   More dopamine introduced, allowed longer letter, number,
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.840]   and information strings to be remembered.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.720]   And of course, forgotten,
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.280]   because that's what working memory involves,
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.780]   remembering and then discarding of information
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.240]   shortly thereafter.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.800]   Now, the findings that I just described
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.200]   compliment what I said before,
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.900]   which is the naturally occurring experiment.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.740]   Bring people into the lab,
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.180]   measure their working memory span,
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.640]   look at how much dopamine they make,
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.120]   higher dopamine, better working memory,
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.000]   lower dopamine, lower working memory.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.820]   The experiment I just described
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.920]   was one in which dopamine is introduced,
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.300]   showing that dopamine is very likely the rate limiting
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.920]   or the capacity limiting,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.880]   that's probably the better way to put it,
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.800]   the capacity limiting neuromodulator
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.760]   for improving working memory.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.920]   That's a fancy nerd speak way of saying
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.360]   more dopamine allows for better working memory.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.280]   But a critical feature of this experiment
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.860]   is that they did a number of experiments
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.480]   where they didn't introduce dopamine,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.680]   but instead they introduced other neuromodulators
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.920]   to the prefrontal cortex,
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.820]   such as norepinephrine or serotonin.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.300]   And the interesting finding is that
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.380]   the addition of norepinephrine or serotonin,
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.420]   which of course are other neuromodulators
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.360]   that can change the firing patterns of neurons
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.500]   in the prefrontal cortex, but elsewhere as well.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.380]   It's just that in this case,
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.220]   they were added to the prefrontal cortex,
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.840]   had no effect on working memory.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.080]   It neither improved nor degraded working memory
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.320]   when those neuromodulators were introduced.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.100]   In other words, dopamine, and perhaps only dopamine,
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.860]   seems to be the dominant neuromodulator
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.140]   for regulating the degree,
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.560]   that is whether or not you have small, medium,
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.300]   or large amounts of working memory capacity
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.820]   in the prefrontal cortex.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.020]   And of course, there have been a bunch of other experiments
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.140]   that are worth mentioning briefly in this context,
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.480]   such as taking people
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.380]   that have a high working memory capacity
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.900]   and then indeed have their brains imaged,
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.220]   and one sees that they have
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.240]   high levels of baseline dopamine,
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.580]   especially the dopamine projecting
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.280]   to the prefrontal cortex.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.700]   And then they're given a drug that depletes dopamine
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.440]   within the prefrontal cortex and their performance drops.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.900]   And so what's so nice about the literature
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.500]   around working memory is that
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.100]   while I'm not covering all of that literature exhaustively,
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.220]   it all tends to jive.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.420]   It all points in a direction
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.140]   whereby the levels of dopamine being released
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.040]   in the prefrontal cortex during working memory tasks
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.620]   correlates very strongly
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:07.100]   with capacity to perform working memory tasks.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.660]   Lower dopamine, lower working memory span, as it's called.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.860]   Higher dopamine, higher working memory span.
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.700]   Okay, so next we're going to do another working memory task
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.900]   different than the one we did earlier.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.260]   And we're going to do that with a specific purpose in mind,
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.660]   which is for you to be able to determine
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.760]   what your working memory capacity is,
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.140]   and by extension, your baseline levels of dopamine,
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.540]   or at least the levels of dopamine
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.180]   that are likely being released into your prefrontal cortex
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.180]   while you do these working memory tasks.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.020]   In other words, we're going to try and figure out
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.280]   whether or not you are of the low, medium,
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.100]   or high working memory capacity.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.400]   And of course, we're doing that in part
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.160]   to try and establish whether or not
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.960]   you likely have low, medium, or high amounts of dopamine
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.760]   available for release in the prefrontal cortex.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.960]   Now, of course, we're not putting you
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.120]   into a positron emission tomography scanning device.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.760]   We aren't able to do that for obvious reasons,
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.540]   but keep in mind that what we were about to do
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.400]   is very similar, and in some cases,
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.500]   identical to laboratory studies
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.920]   where the researchers were trying to determine
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.120]   what people's levels of dopamine
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.660]   within these particular neural networks
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.860]   we've been discussing, the mesocortical pathway,
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.240]   are likely to be.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.160]   In other words, performance on the working memory task
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.240]   that we are about to do is a decent indication
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.920]   of what the dopamine levels that are available
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.740]   for release in your prefrontal cortex perhaps might be.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.100]   Now, I say perhaps might be
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.760]   because I don't want to cause any unnecessary alarm
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.040]   if, for instance, you fall into
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.620]   the low working memory span group.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.580]   In fact, if you fall into the low working memory span group,
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.820]   there are actually some terrific tools that you can use
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.860]   to improve dopamine transmission in those pathways
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.400]   and improve your working memory.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.060]   I also don't want people to get the impression
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.660]   that somehow performance on this working memory task
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.880]   is reflective of some larger dopamine issue in the brain,
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.720]   and certainly it is not, I repeat,
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.800]   it is not diagnostic of Parkinson's
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.720]   or any kind of neurodegenerative condition.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.320]   Although I will say that deficits in working memory
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.360]   are common in patients with Parkinson's for obvious reasons.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.080]   Those patients have deficits in dopamine neurons,
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.120]   not only production, but the number of dopamine neurons,
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.320]   it's one of the hallmark features of Parkinson's,
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.840]   but also in things like traumatic brain injury, et cetera.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.960]   But the working memory tasks that you're about to take
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.680]   when given to a general population
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.000]   or a group of undergraduates or so-called normals
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.200]   or typical control subjects, which all of you are, okay?
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.660]   So unless you're dealing with a traumatic brain injury
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.020]   or you know you have Parkinson's,
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.520]   we know that the data that you're going to get back right now
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.880]   is very similar to the data that people get back
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.740]   when they do these sorts of studies in a laboratory.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.780]   That is, it's typical for some people
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.320]   to have a short working memory span,
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.040]   some people to have a medium working memory span,
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.200]   and some people to have a high working memory span.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.940]   And today we're actually just going to divide into two bins,
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.600]   short working memory span and high working memory span.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.700]   And we can have some degree of confidence
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.520]   that correlates with the amount of dopamine available
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.800]   for release in the frontal cortex.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.320]   But, and this is a very important point,
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.640]   as we progress along this discussion of working memory,
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.620]   the neural circuits, dopamine, et cetera,
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.380]   I want to make clear something that I said earlier,
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.600]   which is that it is not the case
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.640]   that increasing the amount of dopamine that's available
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.240]   always increases working memory span.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.080]   In fact, there's a common circumstance whereby people
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.240]   with a relatively high degree of working memory capacity
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.040]   increase their dopamine levels even further
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.480]   using pharmacology or other methods that we'll discuss,
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.000]   and their performance actually can degrade, okay?
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.720]   So if any of that is confusing now,
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.960]   we'll make it all very simple going forward
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.320]   so that if you decide to implement any of the protocols
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.740]   discussed in this episode,
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.440]   that you are aware of what you can expect
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.200]   and whether or not you were in the category of people
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.700]   that should or perhaps should not
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.240]   incorporate those protocols.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.560]   Okay, let's test your working memory again.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.540]   This time, the working memory task is going to be
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.240]   a little bit different than the one you did previously.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.540]   This working memory task involves me reading
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.560]   six different sentences to you,
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.720]   and your job is to pay attention to these six sentences
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.680]   because you're going to be asked some information
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.280]   about these sentences in a few moments.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.740]   The first sentence is real estate costs are going up.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.240]   The second sentence is the Atlantic Ocean is warm in summer.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.280]   The third sentence is there's a lot of interest now
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.580]   in electric cars.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:27.300]   The fourth sentence is some reptiles eat only once a year.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:32.400]   The fifth sentence is kids nowadays look at screens
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.060]   more than 60% of their waking life.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.640]   And the sixth and final sentence is football can mean
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.120]   different sports depending on the country.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.060]   Okay, so I read you six sentences.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.980]   They were moderately long, I confess.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.160]   Your job for the working memory task is now to recall
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.760]   as many of the final words of each of those sentences
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.080]   as you can.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.440]   I'll give you a few moments to do that.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.160]   Now, before I tell you what the final word
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.840]   of each of those sentences actually is,
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.640]   I want to remind everybody that working memory capacity
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.460]   follows a normal distribution.
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.280]   So some of you will be able to remember the final word
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.200]   of perhaps five or even six of those sentences.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.040]   Although I must say that is exceedingly rare.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.520]   Some of you are going to be able to remember three to four
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.560]   of the final words of those sentences.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.740]   And that's more typical.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.440]   That actually represents the average or the mean
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.840]   as we call it.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.160]   And then fewer people, although still many of you
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.640]   will only be able to remember one or two
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.840]   of the final words of those sentences.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.300]   Okay, so now I'm assuming that most of you
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.120]   have tried to call to memory the final word
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.960]   of as many of those six sentences as you can.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.180]   And maybe you've written them down
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.780]   or you've typed them into your phone
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.160]   or you have some record of what you recall
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.200]   those six final words of those sentences are.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.220]   Now I'm going to tell you the actual final word
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.560]   of each of those sentences.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.300]   The final word of the first sentence was up
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.540]   because as you may recall the sentence was
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.440]   real estate costs are going up.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.880]   The final word of the second sentence was summer
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.360]   because the sentence was the Atlantic ocean
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.580]   is warm in summer.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.720]   The final word of the third sentence was cars
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.560]   because the sentence was there is a lot of interest
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.540]   in electric cars.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.160]   The final word of the fourth sentence was year
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.380]   because the sentence was some reptiles eat only once a year.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:34.040]   The final word of the fifth sentence was life
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   because the sentence was kids nowadays look at screens
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.040]   more than 60% of their waking life.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.200]   And the final word of the sixth sentence was country
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.720]   because the sentence was football can mean different sports
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.420]   depending on the country.
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.400]   Okay, so be honest with yourself and tell yourself
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.000]   and you don't have to tell anyone else if you don't want to
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.680]   how many of the final words of those six sentences
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.360]   you could remember correctly.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.460]   It's important that you remember them correctly.
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.420]   Again, the number of words that you can recall
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.920]   that is your working memory span is going to vary
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.200]   from person to person.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.820]   But we can take the normal distribution of those scores
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.460]   and sort of draw a line down the middle
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.300]   and say that if you could remember three to six
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.160]   of the final words of those sentences correctly
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.900]   you're going to fall into the high working memory
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.240]   span group.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.160]   Whereas if you could only remember one or two
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.660]   or maybe zero of the final words of those six sentences
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.000]   then you're going to be in the low working memory
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:29.840]   span group.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.420]   Again, I don't want to alarm anybody.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.300]   This doesn't mean that you have any global memory deficits
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.520]   or dopamine deficits, but it is important
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.460]   especially if you plan to apply any of the protocols
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.300]   to improve working memory that you faithfully
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.100]   that is you accurately report your working memory
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.840]   performance at least to yourself.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.480]   Now, as you recall, whether or not you have low or high
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.320]   and here we are just binning into low and high
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.160]   there's no medium.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.760]   We've divided right at that line.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.400]   We're saying, if you can remember three to six
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.920]   we're calling that high working memory span
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.120]   at least for this discussion.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.600]   And if you can remember fewer than three, even down to zero
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.200]   of the final words of those sentences
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.720]   that's low working memory span.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.280]   We're dividing it in two.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.680]   We divided you into two groups.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.280]   And we do know when this has been done
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.200]   in large numbers of human subjects
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.400]   and some, in some cases, all of those subjects
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.360]   have their brains imaged for the amount of dopamine
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.280]   available for release in their prefrontal cortex
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.720]   that short working memory span correlates
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.080]   with lower amounts of dopamine.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.280]   Whereas higher working memory span
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.460]   or longer working memory span
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.920]   whatever you want to call it correlates
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.060]   with more dopamine available for release
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.920]   in the prefrontal cortex.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.880]   Now, this is where things get really interesting
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.120]   and frankly, really exciting for everybody
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:48.000]   especially the folks in the low working memory span group
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   work from Martes Bizito and colleagues at UC Berkeley
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.520]   as well as other laboratories
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.560]   have explored the consequences of increasing dopamine levels
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.200]   in the brain of typical populations of individuals.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.840]   So these are not people with Parkinson's or TBI
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.400]   but undergraduate students
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.960]   which we do realize is not completely representative
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.360]   of the quote unquote normal population
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.400]   outside the university, but also people from the community.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.320]   So people who are not university students and so on.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.480]   And the ways that they've increased dopamine
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.920]   in those individuals had tended to rely on pharmacology.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.920]   So these are prescription drugs
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.680]   that most often have been developed
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.820]   for the treatment of Parkinson's
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.480]   in order to increase dopamine levels
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.320]   but for some other purposes as well.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.000]   Drugs like bromocriptine
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.320]   which we know are so-called dopamine agonists.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.800]   And agonists is a drug that has the consequence
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.560]   of increasing the amount of a given neurochemical
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.720]   in this case, dopamine.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.000]   Whereas an antagonist is a drug that either blocks
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.660]   or prevents or somehow lowers the total available amount
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.800]   of a certain chemical
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.040]   such as dopamine or serotonin, et cetera.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   So bromocriptine is a drug that increases dopamine.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.700]   So when human subjects came into a laboratory
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.200]   didn't take any drug, no bromocriptine yet.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.240]   And of course they were being evaluated
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.520]   for whether or not they were taking any meds for ADHD
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.180]   their caffeine consumption, et cetera.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.960]   There were certain rule ins and rule outs for that study
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.280]   but certainly people that were taking any kind
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.080]   of prescription medication for ADHD
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.440]   were not included in the study
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.760]   or were eliminated from the study
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:21.400]   because those drugs can indeed increase dopamine
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.080]   as well as some other neuromodulators
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.160]   such as norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.780]   I covered all that in the two ADHD episodes that I did
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.520]   which again, you can find it human lab.com
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.720]   just go to the search function, put in ADHD.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.360]   In any event, in these studies,
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.480]   they took people that had not taken any drugs
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.960]   to increase dopamine, had their working memory measured
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.360]   very similarly to the way
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.520]   that you measured your working memory a few minutes ago
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.840]   with the six sentence business that we did.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.160]   And then they took bromocriptine
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.280]   and they either took a low, a moderate
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.960]   or high dose of bromocriptine.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.500]   And 90 minutes later, they took a working memory task.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.240]   And what was observed was very interesting.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.480]   You can probably predict what it is
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.560]   based on everything I've said up until now.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.320]   Individuals that initially had low baseline levels
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.880]   of dopamine and therefore shorter working memory span.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.000]   So they only remembered zero to about three
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.320]   of the final words of that six sentence series.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.280]   Their performance significantly improved.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.720]   They were able to remember four and in some cases
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.920]   up to six of the final words of those sentences.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.600]   Now that is in complete agreement
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.920]   with everything we set up until now.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.140]   Simply says that dopamine is important for working memory.
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.840]   If you start off with lower dopamine stores
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.380]   or dopamine availability for release in the prefrontal cortex
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:42.040]   lower working memory performance,
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.080]   increased dopamine through ingestion of bromocriptine,
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.620]   which is this dopamine agonist.
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.740]   All of the circuit changes that we want
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.100]   and would expect to improve working memory occur
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.920]   and indeed working memory improves.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.360]   Very straightforward.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.200]   That's interesting.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.020]   But the even more interesting part of the study
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.720]   is that individuals that already had
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.160]   high working memory span, when they took bromocriptine
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.800]   at a low or a moderate dose,
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.180]   their working memory did not increase further.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.460]   Now, if somebody was already getting six of the final words
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:14.980]   of those six sentences, well then of course
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.780]   they couldn't improve their performance anymore.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.060]   But many of the people in the high working memory span group
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.560]   of course only remembered four, in some cases three,
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.160]   typically it would be four, five or six
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.860]   of the final words of those sentences.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.860]   When they took bromocriptine at low or moderate doses
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.080]   their working memory did not improve significantly.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:36.280]   There was either no change or a very modest change.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.180]   And here's where things get really interesting.
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.060]   When individuals who already had a high working memory span
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.140]   took the highest dose of bromocriptine.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.540]   And by the way, studies verified that the amount
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.700]   of dopamine available indeed increased.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.260]   So that was important to do and they did that.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:54.480]   Well, their working memory performance actually decreased
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.400]   such that now they had a short or a low working memory span.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.980]   So what this tells us is that the relationship
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.260]   between dopamine and working memory follows
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.820]   an inverted U-shape function.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.020]   So imagine a U and then just flip it over,
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.740]   meaning if you have low dopamine availability
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:13.140]   in the prefrontal cortex, working memory span is short.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.940]   As you increase that amount, working memory becomes greater.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.700]   But if you increase the amount of dopamine
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.800]   in the prefrontal cortex too much,
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.000]   working memory span actually drops significantly
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.740]   below the baseline that you started with.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.320]   Now, this is important for a number of reasons,
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.900]   not the least of which is the known relationship
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.940]   between working memory and attention.
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:36.380]   Now, this is very important to understand
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.060]   in the context of ADHD,
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.100]   but also for people who don't have ADHD
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:43.280]   and are struggling to maintain focus and attention
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.060]   and carry out working memory tasks
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.480]   throughout their normal everyday life,
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.260]   not in the laboratory, but just moving through life.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:51.860]   Because these days we hear a lot, a lot, a lot
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.320]   about people struggling with focus and attention.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.700]   Perhaps, we don't know, perhaps in part
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.900]   due to overuse of smartphone, social media, et cetera,
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.420]   although there's not yet a direct causal relationship
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.100]   that's been established, the data that are emerging
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.780]   suggests that indeed overuse of those things
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:08.740]   can cause problems.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.260]   But regardless of the source,
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.980]   there does seem to be more ADHD,
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:17.580]   both in kids and in adults and subclinical challenges
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:18.860]   in focus and attention.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.940]   And here's where things get really interesting
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.660]   as it relates to the neural circuitry.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.620]   Work from Desposito and colleagues
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.220]   and other laboratories as well
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.440]   have shown using the similar paradigm
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.500]   that I described before,
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.600]   giving people drugs to increase their baseline levels
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.520]   of dopamine above their initial starting point
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.620]   of short or long-term memory span capacity.
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.660]   And then had people can perform different types
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:43.460]   of working memory tasks that tap into two different aspects
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:44.960]   of attention and working memory.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.880]   Up until now, we've been talking about working memory,
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.280]   it's kind of just one thing.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.860]   But working memory actually involves two things
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.100]   or at least two things.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.340]   The first is that in order to carry out a working memory task
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.780]   and to attend to something, to really focus,
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.680]   we need the ability to rule out distractors.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.660]   We need to be able to not pay attention
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.460]   to things that would otherwise distract us.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.320]   In addition to that, we need to be able to switch
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.440]   from one context to the next, right?
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   Making the cup of coffee to putting on one shoes
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.280]   and heading out the door.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.820]   And in some cases, layering different contexts together,
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.720]   talking on the phone while tying one shoes
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.620]   and so on and so forth.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:24.040]   What this work shows us is that the ability to task switch
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.900]   and context switch that is to shift around
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.300]   what it is that we're paying attention to
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:29.440]   and interleave different things
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.560]   that we're paying attention to,
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:31.880]   something that's so critical
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.500]   for moving through our daily lives,
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.460]   is largely dependent on the dopamine projections
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.160]   to a structure in the brain called the basal ganglia,
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.120]   which is a structure I've talked about before
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.920]   on this podcast, but if you didn't hear about it,
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.940]   we can just broadly define this structure
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.140]   as being involved in movement generation
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.180]   and stopping movement generation.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.020]   In fact, it's often discussed as the neural circuitry
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.160]   that generates go, as in do commands,
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.380]   and no go, don't do commands.
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.180]   So the basal ganglia are involved in task switching
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.120]   and they're involved in task switching
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.020]   in part by sending certain commands to go,
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.740]   do certain things and no go, to not do other things.
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.920]   Okay, task switching, stop doing this, start doing that,
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.780]   start doing that, stop doing this.
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.680]   And sometimes to varying extents, right?
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.680]   I mean, we could take any real world scenario
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.480]   of tying one shoes while talking on the phone
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.620]   and we could micro analyze it in the context of this,
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:23.480]   but I think if you think about it just a little bit,
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.000]   you understand that in order to perform daily tasks,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.280]   we need to be able to task switch
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.700]   and that's not always a start one task end,
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.920]   start a new task end.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.680]   Oftentimes we're interleaving different tasks
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.840]   to varying degrees.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.360]   Now, the other aspect of working memory and attention
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.360]   is to eliminate distractions, to not pay attention
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.800]   to the irrelevant stuff in one's environment
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.000]   or even the irrelevant stuff on your own body.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.960]   Like you can't get distracted by, you know,
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.400]   a button that, you know, might be only partially buttoned
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.040]   or maybe some little something on your sleeve
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.040]   if you're trying to do something else at that moment.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.360]   Okay, and people with ADHD
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.940]   and people who have subclinical challenges and focus
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.040]   really have a hard time with this, right?
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.660]   You know, the sort of stereotype is, you know, the,
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:03.320]   oh look, a squirrel, that whole thing.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.080]   But really this typically exists as a more subtle
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.900]   and challenging phenomenon for people
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.720]   where they either can't remember what they were doing
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.680]   or they're simply drawn down different trajectories,
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.180]   different thought trajectories or action trajectories
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.560]   and then they have a hard time making it back
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.160]   to the original thing that they were trying to focus on.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.060]   And we know based on these studies of dopamine
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.200]   and neuroimaging that eliminating distractors
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.440]   is largely the consequence of dopamine neurons
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.000]   projecting to the prefrontal cortex.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.360]   Okay, now, why am I telling you
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.740]   all this neural circuitry stuff?
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.040]   Well, yes, there are a bunch of studies
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.160]   showing that if you selectively activate the neurons
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.520]   that send dopamine into the basal ganglia,
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.880]   you improve task switching ability
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:47.040]   without an improved ability to rule out distractors.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.520]   Or if you selectively increase the amount of dopamine
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.440]   from neurons projecting the prefrontal cortex,
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.760]   that you're able to selectively improve
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:58.280]   the elimination of distractors without improving
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.840]   task switching ability.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.200]   For practical purposes, in this discussion,
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.880]   we want to pay careful attention
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.640]   to whether or not the data tell us
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.400]   that those particular protocols, those particular approaches
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.560]   are globally increasing dopamine,
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.280]   that is increasing the activity of dopamine neurons
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.040]   projecting to the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:20.180]   or selectively to the basal ganglia
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:22.080]   or selectively to the prefrontal cortex.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.320]   And what I can tell you now is that fortunately,
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.480]   there are several protocols, some of which are behavioral,
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.800]   some of which involve specific over-the-counter supplements
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.360]   and some of which involve prescription pharmacology
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.240]   that can tap into each of these systems independently
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.880]   as well as globally increased dopamine
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.060]   to improve focus and working memory at large.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.200]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.800]   to acknowledge our sponsor, Element.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.280]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.400]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.320]   That means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.400]   of the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.160]   And that correct ratio of electrolytes
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.320]   is extremely important because every cell in your body,
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.600]   but especially your nerve cells, your neurons,
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.680]   relies on electrolytes in order to function properly.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.180]   So when you're well hydrated
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.060]   and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.900]   in your system, your mental functioning
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:13.000]   and your physical functioning is improved.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.840]   I drink one packet of Element dissolved
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:17.240]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.800]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.760]   as well as while I exercise.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.840]   And if I've sweat a lot during that exercise,
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.320]   I often will drink a third Element packet dissolved
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.280]   in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.460]   Element comes in a variety of different flavors,
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.400]   all of which I find really tasty.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.060]   I like the citrus, I like the watermelon,
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.140]   I like the raspberry.
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.980]   Frankly, I can't pick just one.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.080]   It also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint,
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.540]   which I find tastes best if they are put into water,
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:43.340]   dissolved, and then heated up.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.780]   I tend to do that in the winter months
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:48.380]   because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.840]   and in the summer and spring months,
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.920]   but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.920]   and the environment tends to be dry.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.080]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.340]   you can go to drink element spelled element.com/huberman
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.580]   to try a free sample pack.
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:05.180]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.900]   Okay, so let's talk about protocols
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.500]   to improve working memory,
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:11.500]   specifically by way of changing levels
[00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.100]   of dopamine in the brain.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.220]   Now I've discussed dopamine many times before
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.060]   in this podcast.
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.100]   In fact, we have entire episodes devoted
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.460]   to optimizing and regulating dopamine.
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.740]   And of course, dopamine comes up within the context
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:26.060]   of the ADHD episodes and other episodes as well.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.800]   And again, if you have specific questions about dopamine
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.140]   or any other topic for that matter,
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:32.740]   if you go to hubermanlab.com,
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:33.940]   that website has been engineered
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.260]   so that you can put one word such as dopamine,
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:37.780]   but also multiple keywords.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.500]   So perhaps dopamine exercise or dopamine cold plunge,
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:43.000]   et cetera, into the search function.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.600]   And it will take you to the specific timestamps
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:49.300]   of multiple episodes where those topics were discussed,
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.560]   as well as newsletters where some of that information
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.160]   has been condensed into short PDF form, et cetera.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.920]   So we certainly are going to cover some material
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.040]   about improving dopamine
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.140]   for sake of improving working memory now.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.880]   But if you're generally interested in the science
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.280]   and pharmacology of dopamine
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.600]   and protocols to modulate dopamine levels,
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.220]   all of that can be found at hubermanlab.com.
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:09.560]   Okay, so let's say you have a short working memory span
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.000]   or a moderate working memory span,
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.740]   and you want to experiment with increasing levels
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.380]   of dopamine for sake of improving working memory.
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.980]   Now, there are a lot of different ways
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.180]   that one could imagine doing that.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.980]   Let's start with the behavioral tools
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.120]   known to increase dopamine stores.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.920]   That is shown in peer reviewed studies
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.980]   to increase dopamine stores within certain circuits
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.100]   of the brain that are relevant
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.660]   for working memory performance.
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:33.780]   And the protocol that immediately leaps to mind
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:38.140]   is the use of certain non-sleep deep rest protocols.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:40.800]   Now, non-sleep deep rest or NSDR
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.300]   is actually a term that I coined
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:45.340]   because there is a practice that's been established
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.460]   for many hundreds of years called yoga nidra,
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.220]   which actually means yoga sleep,
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.900]   whereby individuals, potentially you,
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:55.440]   if you decide to do them, lie down, listen to a script,
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.820]   that is listen to an audio script,
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.620]   which generally instructs you to do long exhale breathing,
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:03.100]   to deliberately relax your musculature of your face
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.260]   and of your body.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.260]   And yoga nidra typically also involves
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.860]   doing certain intentions.
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.080]   And the instruction always given
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.340]   at the beginning of yoga nidra
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:12.900]   is that you should try to not fall asleep.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:14.780]   Now, some people sometimes fall asleep,
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.020]   some people don't fall asleep,
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:18.460]   but the idea, and there are data support,
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:20.220]   that yoga nidra puts people
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.780]   into kind of a shallow pattern of sleep,
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.460]   certainly not deep sleep and not rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:29.080]   but it's a very interesting and unusual brain state
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.900]   for which we're starting to understand more
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:34.820]   and actually have some plans in the not too distant future
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.860]   to collaborate with Matthew Walker,
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.180]   the author of the book, "Why We Sleep,"
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.140]   and some other colleagues
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.280]   to try and figure out what exact patterns of neural activity
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.700]   are taking place in the brain and rest of nervous system
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:47.960]   during yoga nidra and this similar protocol,
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.580]   which I call non-sleep deep rest.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:52.120]   The difference between yoga nidra and non-sleep deep rest
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.400]   is that non-sleep deep rest
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.380]   doesn't include any of the intentions
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:58.380]   and removes a lot of the kind of opaque
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:01.100]   or sometimes called mystical language from the protocol.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:04.560]   Now, a great thing is that yoga nidra scripts or protocols,
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.040]   as well as NSDR scripts or protocols are available,
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.100]   totally zero cost.
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.560]   You can find them certainly on apps like Waking Up,
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.640]   but also on YouTube.
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:16.000]   For instance, if you put NSDR and my last name,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.760]   there's a 10 minute NSDR script there.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.680]   There are a lot of yoga nidra scripts.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.700]   If you prefer a female voice,
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:22.540]   there are a lot of different,
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:24.160]   excellent female voices out there.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.200]   One in particular that I like very much is Kelly Boyce,
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.700]   first name Kelly, last name B-O-Y-S.
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:32.120]   She has both yoga nidra and NSDR scripts
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.380]   of various durations of anywhere from eight minutes
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.260]   all the way out to, I believe, 45 minutes.
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:38.380]   Why am I telling you all this?
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.380]   Well, there've been several studies, but in particular one,
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.220]   and I do realize we're talking about only one study,
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.780]   but the results are really intriguing
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:48.280]   as it relates to what we're talking about today.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.120]   In this study,
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.500]   they had individuals do effectively an NSDR protocol.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.620]   They call it yoga nidra.
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.640]   And the protocol they used
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.120]   was essentially a yoga nidra script.
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.020]   They had people lie down and listen to a yoga nidra script
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:01.220]   and to perform yoga nidra.
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:05.740]   And they evaluated the amount of dopamine available
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.540]   within the brain both prior to
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:10.240]   and after performing this yoga nidra script.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.140]   And what they discovered was that
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:16.360]   after performing a yoga nidra protocol,
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.420]   the baseline levels of dopamine,
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.100]   that is the amount of dopamine available
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.820]   in the basal ganglia and a few other structures
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.400]   of the human brain, of course, these are humans,
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.840]   was increased by as much as 60%
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.560]   as compared to individuals that did a different protocol,
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.800]   not yoga nidra, not NSDR.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.900]   Now, did that study evaluate lots of different durations
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.540]   of yoga nidra, AKA NSDR?
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.380]   No.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:46.940]   They looked at fairly long hour plus yoga nidra sessions.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.700]   However, there's some other data
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:52.900]   that have explored yoga nidra, AKA NSDR,
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.560]   in the context of cognitive performance
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.440]   and a few other circumstances,
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.680]   all of which point to the fact that cognitive performance
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.940]   and in particular cognitive performance tasks
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.740]   that have a working memory element to them.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.500]   So they weren't the exact working memory tasks
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.500]   that you did earlier,
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.580]   but they have a working memory element to them.
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.640]   That is, subjects had to keep certain small batches
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.400]   of information in mind and then discard that information
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.120]   in order to be able to perform the task well.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.440]   All of those show significant improvements
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.800]   in task performance.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.900]   So while something like NSDR or yoga nidra
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.100]   might sound kind of mystical or kind of wishy-washy,
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.700]   or I guess as the kids say, weak sauce to some of you,
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.880]   it is anything but weak sauce.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.520]   It is really powerful stuff.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.260]   And it's powerful stuff as it relates
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.720]   to the very neurochemicals and neural circuits
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.420]   that are involved in working memory.
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.460]   So if I were to take a step back and just say,
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:46.580]   okay, what are some zero cost, very low,
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:50.260]   if any risk protocols that one could perform
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.160]   in order to improve dopamine levels
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.760]   without having to ingest anything, take anything,
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.180]   really do much of anything at all, except lie there,
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.260]   do this progressive muscle relaxation.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.600]   There are a few other things involved in NSDR as well,
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.180]   which you'll learn if you decide to try them,
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:07.420]   and improve or increase the levels of dopamine availability
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:11.380]   in the brain significantly, well, then NSDR and yoga nidra
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.620]   really are the first line tools if one wants to do that.
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.980]   I think it's reasonable to say that.
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.100]   And as I mentioned before, there's no reason to think
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.940]   that there's any risk of doing NSDR yoga nidra,
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.500]   provide that you're lying down in a safe place
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.660]   as opposed to like in the middle of the road or something.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.980]   But assuming you do it in a safe location,
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.340]   I would encourage you to try it for,
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:33.240]   really for 20 to 30 minutes when you first explore it,
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.340]   perhaps you do longer.
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.880]   Although I personally have a hard time
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.180]   doing long yoga nidra scripts regularly,
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.940]   a full hour is a big commitment.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.780]   I don't generally have that much time.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.080]   I often will do a 10 minute NSDR.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.200]   Have there been brain imaging experiments done
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.100]   for each and all of these yoga nidra scripts
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.780]   to determine the amount,
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:53.540]   or if there's any dopamine increase within the brain?
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.260]   No, but I think that we can safely extrapolate
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.520]   from that wonderful study out of Scandinavia
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.180]   that showed that when human subjects
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.260]   do this yoga nidra protocol,
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.940]   that there's a significant increase
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:06.700]   in baseline dopamine levels within key neural structures
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.420]   that relate to working memory.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.820]   Now, many of you perhaps heard that getting in a cold plunge
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.660]   or taking a cold shower, or provided you can do it safely,
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:18.380]   getting into a cold ocean or a cold lake can significantly,
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.700]   maybe even double or even triple
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.680]   your circulating dopamine levels.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.480]   And indeed that is true.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.080]   It has been shown that when people get into cold water,
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.800]   typically up to their neck,
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.780]   and that cold water, by the way,
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:36.580]   can range in temperature anywhere from low 40s to low 60s,
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.220]   depending on how long you stay in,
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:40.040]   that there is a significant increase
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.480]   in the so-called circulating catecholamines.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.520]   What are the catecholamines?
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.980]   The catecholamines are dopamine,
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.680]   norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.640]   Now, the evidence for the catecholamine increase
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.660]   in response to cold water mainly stems from two studies,
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:52.720]   and in particular one.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.940]   And in that particular study,
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.260]   they had people get into, I wouldn't say super cold water.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.080]   It was in the low 60 degrees.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.780]   And by the way, I'm speaking in Fahrenheit here.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:05.340]   And they had those human subjects submerged in water
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.180]   up to their neck.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.860]   I think they actually had them sitting in lawn chairs
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.280]   on the bottom of a pool.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.780]   But again, their heads were above water
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.900]   so they could breathe.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:14.060]   And they stayed in for quite a long while,
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:15.400]   45 minutes or longer.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.580]   And it was observed that there was a big,
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:20.540]   big statistically significant increase
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.740]   in epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:25.060]   that lasted several hours or more.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:26.300]   This is one of the reasons why,
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.880]   if you've ever done deliberate cold exposure as it's called,
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.800]   it often is uncomfortable when you get in,
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.020]   but then when you get out, you feel different.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:36.300]   You feel really good in most cases,
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.660]   provided if you're me, you take a warm shower afterwards.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.620]   Yes, I like to do that.
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:41.340]   I realize if you want to increase your metabolism,
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.540]   perhaps it's better to not warm up afterwards.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.220]   I like a nice warm shower or to get in the sauna afterwards.
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.300]   That's just me.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.660]   But nonetheless, deliberate cold exposure
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.900]   clearly induces a state shift of mind and body
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.020]   that most people, provided they do it correctly
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.140]   and they don't go into water that's far too cold for them
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:00.700]   for too long, they report as pleasant.
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.500]   And I think it's reasonable to assume
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.940]   that some of that is the consequence
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.800]   of these increases in catecholamines,
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.120]   which is why many people opt for a cold shower,
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:09.960]   which if you're me,
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.080]   cold shower followed by a warm or hot shower
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.420]   or a cold plunge in the morning,
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:15.680]   or maybe even just once or twice a week.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.740]   Many people like them.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.780]   Typically people like getting out of them
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.180]   and the feeling that they have after they do them.
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:23.160]   Although some of you sickos really like the feeling
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.060]   of getting in and being in it, but not me.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.160]   The point here is that if we were to take a look
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.860]   at the landscape of zero cost behavioral tools,
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:32.660]   in fact, behavioral tools that could potentially
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.380]   save you money, meaning reduce your heating bill,
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.660]   that are known to increase the very neurochemicals,
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.700]   AKA dopamine, that are involved in improving working memory,
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:45.020]   I think it's reasonable to assume that a cold shower
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:47.300]   about 30 to 60 minutes prior
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.060]   to doing any kind of working memory tasks
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:50.060]   or any kind of activity
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:53.540]   that would require increased focus could be, okay,
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.560]   we don't know, the specific studies have not been done,
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.540]   but could be in theory.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.140]   It makes sense mechanistically, it's logically sound,
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.860]   could be done after deliberate cold exposure.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.180]   And indeed many people report not just feeling
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:09.000]   a bit of mild euphoria or feeling good
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.180]   after deliberate cold exposure,
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.620]   but also an increased capacity to focus.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.540]   In fact, so much so that a lot of people
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:16.580]   who do deliberate cold exposure say that they don't require
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.300]   as much caffeine in order to maintain
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.340]   their alertness and energy,
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:21.980]   which shouldn't be surprising to us at all, right?
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.700]   I mean, it's increasing catecholamines, we know this.
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:27.580]   So that's another protocol that you could explore as well.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.420]   Is there an important difference or not
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:32.420]   between deliberate cold exposure done by cold shower
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.700]   or deliberate cold exposure in a cold plunge or the ocean?
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.400]   Frankly, there haven't been a lot of studies
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.960]   comparing those, but I think it stands to reason
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.240]   that if you have access to a cold plunge
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.260]   or a cold body of water that you can safely get into
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.460]   up to your neck for 30 seconds to a minute,
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.660]   if it's 50 degrees or less, right?
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:50.980]   If you get in colder water, we know, for instance,
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:53.300]   if you get into say 45 degree water
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.820]   and you only get in for 30 seconds,
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.220]   you're going to get a big increase in the catecholamines,
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.260]   perhaps as big as the catecholamine increase
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.920]   that you would get from being in 60 degree water
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.880]   for 45 minutes.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.500]   Most people don't have 45 minutes to sit around in water
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.340]   up to their neck.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.300]   So most people opt for 30 seconds
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.540]   to as much as three minutes deliberate cold exposure
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:15.740]   in a shower or cold plunge or other body of water.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.200]   Again, only do this if you can do it safely.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.640]   Never, ever, please, for the love of God,
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.360]   please never, ever do any kind of hyperventilation breathing
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.980]   or breath holding while doing deliberate cold exposure
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.640]   because you can pass out, you can die.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.740]   Don't combine breath work and deliberate cold exposure.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.700]   Just don't. Separate those two things completely, okay?
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.540]   But deliberate cold exposure, we know,
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.960]   is a very reliable way to increase the catecholamines,
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.820]   which includes dopamine.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.900]   So if you want to explore deliberate cold exposure protocols
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:46.060]   and get into the nuance of temperature and duration, et cetera,
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.780]   you can find that, completely zero cost.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.980]   Go to Hubermanlab.com, go to the menu tab,
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:51.140]   scroll down to newsletter
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.240]   and go to the cold exposure newsletter
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.040]   where it details all of that in short PDF form.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.460]   Now, some of you are probably asking,
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.180]   hey, what if I was in the high
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.860]   or long working memory span group?
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.420]   I ought to have high baseline levels of dopamine.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:08.180]   Should I not do yoga nidra or NSDR?
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:11.460]   Should I not do deliberate cold exposure?
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.260]   Well, there, you're just going to have to experiment.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.580]   Again, there's essentially zero risk
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:18.980]   to doing yoga nidra, NSDR, as I mentioned before.
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:19.940]   Deliberate cold exposure,
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.340]   there's always some risk getting into water, cold water.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.180]   People always want to know how cold.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:25.620]   Well, the newsletter gets to this,
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.840]   but I'll just tell you right now as well.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.580]   The ideal temperature is the temperature
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.260]   that you can safely get into and stay in
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:34.660]   for a duration of 30 seconds to three minutes
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:35.920]   before getting out.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.180]   Some people opt to go longer,
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.660]   but I think 30 seconds to three minutes
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.580]   is a good duration to work with for most people,
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.480]   especially if you're going to do it frequently.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.160]   So the temperature should be safe
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.580]   for you to stay in for that duration,
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.840]   but uncomfortable enough that there's some impulse
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.700]   to want to get out,
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.140]   that you have to work to stay in there,
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.860]   that you have to kind of overcome that adrenaline release
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:57.300]   and the impulse to get out.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.100]   So for some people that's going to be 45 degrees,
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.580]   for some people it'll be 40 degrees,
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.040]   depends on how cold adapted you are,
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.180]   depends on how rested you are.
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.980]   There is no specific temperature.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.660]   You have to really gauge for yourself.
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.380]   And so err on the side of caution
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.220]   and you can experiment provided you experiment
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:12.700]   within the margins of safety.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.460]   So if you found during the working memory tasks
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:15.300]   that you took today,
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:17.340]   that you have a very good working memory,
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.280]   I don't think there's any reason to avoid
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.680]   yoga nidra, NSDR, and deliberate cold exposure.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:24.340]   In fact, there may be reasons to increase your dopamine
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:27.180]   and other catecholamines by way of NSDR, yoga nidra,
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:29.000]   deliberate cold exposure.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.560]   Perhaps for working memory performance,
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.160]   maybe it could increase further.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.840]   Perhaps it would decrease performance,
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.380]   in which case there, you got your answer.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.860]   You don't have to do those protocols again,
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.780]   and you certainly wouldn't want to do them before anything
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.900]   that involves a lot of working memory and attention.
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:44.420]   But of course, those protocols have other benefits as well.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.100]   So there's no reason to avoid them entirely,
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.220]   just perhaps avoid them within the context
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.780]   of trying to improve working memory.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.680]   However, if you're somebody that has challenges
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.900]   with working memory, challenges with attention,
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.380]   challenges with focus,
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.380]   well then I think that the protocols I've been talking about
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.880]   up until now would be an excellent first foray
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.220]   into the sorts of things that you could do
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.680]   to increase dopamine.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.620]   And of course those other catecholamines
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.960]   as a way to see whether or not it augments
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.040]   your focus and attention and working memory capacity.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.880]   Now, some of you are probably shouting, shouting, shouting.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.760]   What about exercise?
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.240]   Doesn't exercise increase dopamine?
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.180]   It does, yes.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.060]   There are other things that increase dopamine.
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:21.520]   It's not just exercise.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.160]   There are activities that increase dopamine.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.000]   Some people are probably saying,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.200]   wait, doesn't playing video games increase dopamine?
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.740]   Sex increases dopamine.
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.080]   Chocolate increases dopamine.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:32.280]   Yes, yes indeed, those things can increase dopamine.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.000]   What's interesting and important about the protocols
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.680]   I've been talking about however,
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.120]   NSDR, yoga nidra, deliberate cold exposure,
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.200]   is not just that they increase dopamine,
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.820]   but the duration over which they increase dopamine.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.960]   Okay, this is very important.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.800]   If you want to understand more about the relationship
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.640]   between dopamine spikes as they're called
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.720]   and dopamine baseline,
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.240]   and why I'm emphasizing these tools that cause large,
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.040]   long lasting increases in baseline dopamine,
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.440]   check out the episodes I did on optimizing dopamine.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.580]   We've got a link to them in the show note captions.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:05.080]   Now, before I talk about other ways to increase dopamine
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.680]   for sake of improving working memory,
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.600]   things like over-the-counter supplements like L-tyrosine,
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.640]   Macuna purine, things like that.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.180]   I do briefly want to mention, and I promise briefly,
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.340]   I know sometimes I say briefly,
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.560]   and then I spend 20 minutes telling you about something,
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.860]   but very briefly, I just want to spend two minutes
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:24.740]   telling you about protocols that we do not yet know
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.160]   whether or not they increase dopamine levels,
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.200]   but we do know that they improve working memory,
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.040]   because after all this episode is about working memory,
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.640]   not just about dopamine and working memory.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.560]   It has been shown that the use of binaural beats, okay,
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.880]   binaural beats being the presentation or the listening
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.440]   to sounds of different frequencies in the two ears,
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.840]   typically by headphones,
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.800]   I think that's been shown to work best.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.760]   And there's a subtraction between the two frequencies
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.000]   such that the brain tends to entrain or start to follow
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.400]   a particular frequency within not the entire brain,
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.720]   but certain neural circuits.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.400]   So if you've heard of say 15 Hertz binaural beats
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.360]   or 40 Hertz binaural beats,
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.060]   that doesn't mean that you listen to a 15 Hertz sound
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:05.920]   or a 40 Hertz sound.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.160]   You listen to two different frequencies of sound,
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.360]   like Hertz is just a measurement of sound frequency
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.740]   in each of the two ears.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:16.640]   And then the difference between them is 40 Hertz or 15 Hertz.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.860]   And there are several studies that show not enormous, okay,
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:20.840]   I want to be clear,
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.440]   small to moderate improvements in working memory performance,
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.760]   but in some cases, significant improvement.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.600]   And I'll provide a link to these two papers
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.480]   in the show note captions,
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.380]   but I'll just briefly describe them by way of their title
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.640]   and their major conclusions.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.320]   The first is a study entitled,
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.000]   the effects of binaural and monaural beat stimulation
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.560]   on cognitive functioning in subjects
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.060]   with different levels of emotionality.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:43.860]   A really interesting study published in 2019,
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.680]   it was a relatively small number of subjects,
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.420]   only 24 participants, 16 males, eight males,
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.380]   between 19 and 31 years old,
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.600]   listen to these 40 Hertz binaural beats.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.800]   And by the way, it's very easy to find apps
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.240]   and other sources of 40 Hertz binaural beats at zero cost
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.780]   or nominal cost out there.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:03.120]   You simply look for 40 Hertz binaural beats
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.880]   and looked at performance on working memory tasks,
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.280]   as well as some other cognitive tasks
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.960]   and found in some cases, a small to moderate,
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.320]   but significant improvement in cognitive performance
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.440]   on working memory tasks.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.540]   The aspect of the study looking at emotionality
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.240]   did not find a significant effect.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.620]   So it doesn't seem that emotionality impacts things there,
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:26.540]   but nonetheless, that study plus the other one entitled,
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.820]   the effect of binaural beats on visual spatial
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.440]   working memory and cortical connectivity.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.920]   This was a study published in 2016,
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.000]   found generally something similar.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.300]   In this case, they were using 15 Hertz binaural beats,
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.440]   and here I'm paraphrasing,
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.280]   produced network activity characteristic
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.600]   of high information transfer
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.920]   with consistent connection strengths.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.100]   What they're really talking about
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:51.400]   is changes in neural activity patterns within the brain
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.880]   that led to, or at least were correlated with,
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.040]   improvements on visual spatial working memory.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.680]   Visual spatial working memory tasks
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.220]   are different than the working memory tasks
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.500]   that you performed earlier.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.480]   Visual spatial working memory tasks
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.300]   involve the cognitive generation that is within your head
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.780]   of the so-called visual spatial sketch pad.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.800]   So it's this idea that you see something
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.620]   and then you got to sketch it out in your mind.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:15.320]   You have to know the relationships between things in space,
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.640]   pay attention to what they are, keep those in mind again,
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.500]   'cause it's working memory
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.220]   just as long as it's necessary to perform a task.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.360]   That's what visual spatial working memory is.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.300]   As you can imagine,
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:27.380]   it translates to an enormous number of everyday activities
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.040]   required for focus and attention
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.760]   and learning and performance.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.820]   And indeed, 15 Hertz binaural beats
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.700]   was able to produce a small but significant improvement
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.300]   in that sort of working memory tasks.
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.640]   So I want to emphasize again,
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.880]   we don't know the relationship
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.420]   between binaural beats and dopamine,
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.020]   at least not from these studies,
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.600]   but I felt I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:52.080]   these two studies that show that 40 Hertz binaural beats,
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.740]   15 Hertz binaural beats
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.160]   can indeed improve working memory performance.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.620]   And in these sorts of scenarios,
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.200]   individuals are listening to the binaural beats
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.440]   while they are doing the working memory task
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.280]   and in some cases,
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.820]   before they are doing the working memory task.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.660]   Either seems to work, it depends on the study.
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:08.620]   There are a bunch of other studies,
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:10.520]   but I thought I'd mention binaural beats
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.960]   because I know a number of people are interested in them.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.960]   Again, non-pharmacologic, zero cost
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.480]   because you can find tools for binaural beat generation,
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.020]   zero cost out there,
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.380]   approaches to improving working memory.
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:25.340]   Okay, what about over-the-counter compounds
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.320]   that are known to increase circulating dopamine
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.500]   that can potentially improve working memory
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.060]   and that indeed have been shown in peer-reviewed studies
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:37.100]   to improve working memory by way of increasing circulating,
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.060]   presumably brain levels of dopamine?
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.260]   Well, I can think of two specific categories of supplements
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:45.020]   that is over-the-counter compounds
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.600]   that at least at this point in time
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.240]   are legal in the United States
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.680]   that can increase dopamine levels.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.500]   Those two are L-tyrosine,
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.240]   which is an amino acid precursor to dopamine
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.140]   and mucuna prurines, which is a,
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:01.060]   believe it or not, it's a velvety bean
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:03.860]   or the outer component of this velvety bean
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:08.860]   that contains or is equivalent to 99% L-dopa.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:12.860]   L-dopa is a key component in the biochemical cascade
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.660]   leading to the production of dopamine.
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.780]   In fact, L-dopa is often prescribed
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.340]   for Parkinson's patients
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.660]   as a means to increase their dopamine levels.
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.020]   There are at least three studies that I am aware of
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:26.220]   of the use of mucuna prurines to increase dopamine
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.860]   for the treatment of Parkinson's.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:30.740]   In other words, mucuna prurines increases dopamine levels
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.500]   and yes, it has been shown to improve
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.680]   some of those symptoms of Parkinson's patients.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.540]   We're not talking about treatment of Parkinson's today.
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:39.740]   I want to caution people against any sort of
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:42.420]   use of supplements to treat Parkinson's or other conditions
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:44.100]   without consulting your doctor, all right?
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.340]   That's very, very critical to point out.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.420]   If we're talking about ways to increase dopamine
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.840]   for sake of improving working memory
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.340]   by way of supplementation,
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.280]   I think we should start with L-tyrosine
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.080]   because L-tyrosine, unlike mucuna prurines,
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.580]   is a bit further up, actually it's way further up
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.540]   the biochemical cascade leading to dopamine production.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.260]   However, it has been shown in several studies
[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.980]   that L-tyrosine supplementation
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.940]   can indeed increase dopamine.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:11.460]   And moreover, and here I'm quoting the title of a study
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.140]   published in 1999, which I realized is a few years back,
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.700]   but of course there's some excellent studies
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.700]   from a few years back or more,
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.160]   tyrosine improves working memory
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.940]   in a multitasking environment.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:24.380]   Now, this particular study from Thomas et al
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.500]   has some interesting aspects and some aspects
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.660]   that made me go a little bit wide-eyed,
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.840]   but not necessarily wide-eyed
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.900]   because the results are so dramatic.
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:34.820]   In fact, when one looks at all of the data in this paper,
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:37.020]   what you find is that supplementing with L-tyrosine
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.680]   as they did in this study,
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.440]   did indeed lead to improvements in working memory
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.440]   under multitask conditions as the title suggests.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.300]   Those improvements were significant,
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:47.880]   but they weren't enormous, okay?
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.300]   They were statistically significant,
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.840]   but they were not enormous increases.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:54.560]   Now, what was enormous and the reason I got wide-eyed
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.960]   and still get wide-eyed is that the dosages
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:01.460]   of L-tyrosine used in the study are really big.
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:05.240]   They had subjects take 150 milligrams per kilogram
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.620]   of L-crystalline tyrosine.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.780]   I had them take it in applesauce for whatever reason
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:12.720]   or placebo and they did a number of different
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.900]   control conditions to make sure that whatever effects
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.120]   of L-tyrosine they observed were in fact due
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.320]   to L-tyrosine supplementation.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:22.660]   Why am I going wide-eyed when I see this 150 milligrams
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.100]   per kilogram of tyrosine?
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:30.100]   Well, I weigh 220 pounds, so that's about 100 kilograms.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:35.540]   So if I weigh 100 kilograms and it's 150 milligrams
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.560]   for every kilogram, that means that if I were a subject
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.180]   in the study that they would give me 15,000 milligrams,
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:47.580]   that is 15 grams of L-tyrosine prior to doing
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:48.660]   these cognitive tasks.
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:53.440]   Now, 15 grams of tyrosine to me seems like a very,
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:56.300]   very high dose and I frankly can't in good conscience
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.260]   recommend that.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:58.100]   Why?
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.300]   Well, maybe I'm just hypersensitive to L-tyrosine,
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:05.820]   but I've taken 1000 or 1500 milligrams of L-tyrosine
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:08.980]   and I've definitely experienced an increase in alertness
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:13.980]   from taking 1.5 grams, not 15, 1.5 grams of L-tyrosine.
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.980]   And in fact, at a subjective level,
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.700]   I can feel a meaningful increase in alertness and focus
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.340]   from 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.020]   So I can't in good conscience suggest that people replicate
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.540]   the exact dose protocols within the study.
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:29.620]   Nonetheless, the study as the title suggests shows
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:33.300]   that supplementing with L-tyrosine can indeed increase
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:34.420]   working memory capacity,
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:36.140]   especially in a multitasking environment,
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:38.740]   which in many ways carries over to the sorts of requirements
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:41.460]   for working memory and attention capacity to get through
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:45.280]   life in a very focused for lack of a better word way,
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.940]   in a very regimented, do this, do that, task switch,
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.180]   multiple things, interleave.
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:52.580]   That's what moving through one's day or at least workday
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:55.700]   or anything that requires cognition and focus entails.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.560]   So first of all, I'll just say what I always say
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.960]   when discussing any kind of compound or prescription drug,
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.420]   never add or remove any supplement
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.960]   from your supplement regimen, if you have one,
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.000]   without consulting with your health provider first
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.840]   to make sure that you are safe
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.260]   to take that particular supplement.
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:12.240]   Now, many physicians, MDs,
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.700]   are not familiar with most supplements.
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:16.020]   So you'll probably need to bring some literature
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.860]   to the phone call or to the visit.
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:19.620]   But of course there are many healthcare providers,
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.940]   including some MDs that are open to supplementation,
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:26.460]   especially these days as supplements have become,
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:28.380]   I would say generally more accepted.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.860]   I mean, there are certain ones like vitamin D3
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.380]   and fish oils and things like that
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:33.820]   that are more common than L-tyrosine,
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:35.980]   but there are many physicians who are open to discussions
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.800]   about supplements such as L-tyrosine.
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:41.140]   If you know that you can supplement with L-tyrosine safely
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.500]   and you opt to do so, what dosages
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.140]   would you potentially take?
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:48.940]   Well, here we have to look at the dosages
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:50.160]   used in these studies.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.060]   I think it's only fair, it's only safe,
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:53.400]   that we acknowledge that these dosages
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.740]   are really, really high.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:57.340]   And I think the logical, the safe thing to do
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.080]   would be to start with the minimal effective dose.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:04.980]   So if you weigh 50 kilograms rather than start right off
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:07.700]   with the equivalent dosage to this study,
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:11.560]   maybe you start with 250 milligrams of L-tyrosine.
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.700]   If you weigh a bit more like me or 100 kilograms
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:17.240]   or 75 kilograms, maybe you take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.940]   and see whether or not you experience a significant effect
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:22.180]   on working memory, attention, and performance.
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:25.140]   So the idea here is to establish the minimal effective dose.
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.520]   I should also point out that some people, not all,
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.660]   but some people experience a bit of a crash
[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:31.340]   after L-tyrosine supplementation,
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:33.720]   such that they feel more alert, more focused,
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.620]   better ability to perform working memory tasks,
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.720]   move about their day, but then three or four hours later,
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.940]   experience kind of a drop.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.480]   So you need to be mindful of that.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:43.160]   In fact, you need to be mindful of any kind of pharmacology
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.460]   where you're increasing dopamine.
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:45.680]   This is one of the reasons why I like
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:47.580]   the behavioral protocols that we talked about earlier,
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:50.540]   because they're known to create big but long lasting
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:53.820]   and slowly tapering off increases in dopamine
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:55.100]   and other catecholamines.
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.660]   Now, for those who are curious about,
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:21:58.540]   and perhaps even want to try mucuna purines,
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.340]   please absolutely talk to your doctor first.
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.340]   Mucuna purines is essentially the equivalent of L-dopa.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:07.300]   L-dopa is a prescription drug, as I mentioned before,
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:11.460]   and mucuna purines potently increases dopamine.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:14.500]   What dosages of mucuna purines can increase dopamine?
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:17.700]   Well, typically in studies of Parkinson's patients,
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.580]   but also studies exploring typical people
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:23.260]   who don't have Parkinson's in cognitive tasks
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:25.220]   or in sports performance have explored
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:28.060]   anywhere from one to five grams of mucuna purines.
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.180]   Mucuna purines, again,
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:31.140]   is a very potent way to increase dopamine.
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:34.180]   And here, if your healthcare provider approves it
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.400]   and you decide to try it,
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.340]   I would suggest starting with a very, very low dose,
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:40.140]   again, to find the minimal effective dose.
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:42.540]   So maybe even just 500 milligrams,
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.100]   not even going to the one gram dose,
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.540]   maybe even 250 milligrams,
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:48.820]   and really evaluating how much mucuna purines
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:51.180]   can produce a meaningful impact
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:53.580]   on working memory and attention for you.
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:55.600]   So mucuna purines is kind of a bridge
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.700]   between over-the-counter supplements and prescription drugs.
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.140]   I say it's a bridge because it is oh so similar
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:02.960]   to that prescription drug, L-DOPA.
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:06.300]   And of course, there is a long list of prescription drugs
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.860]   that are known to be dopamine agonists,
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.460]   several of which, many of which, in fact,
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.220]   have been shown to improve working memory.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.060]   You already learned about one of those before,
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.240]   which is bromocriptine.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.100]   Now, you need a prescription from a physician
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:19.280]   to get bromocriptine,
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.160]   but bromocriptine, we know,
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.060]   based on that work from Desposito and colleagues
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:25.000]   that I talked about earlier,
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.340]   increases dopamine.
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.260]   It does so in about 90 minutes.
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:30.480]   It achieves peak levels of dopamine about 90 minutes
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.560]   and improves working memory in individuals
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.640]   that start off with a low working memory span.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.480]   And we know from neuroimaging,
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:37.380]   those are the individuals
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.520]   with lower baseline levels of dopamine.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.020]   So should you run out and ask your doctor for bromocriptine?
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:44.260]   Maybe, most doctors won't prescribe bromocriptine
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:45.680]   for that reason.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.500]   I should mention that work from Desposito lab
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:50.980]   and other laboratories has shown that
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.340]   one of the hallmark features of traumatic brain injury,
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:56.560]   especially frontal lobe injury,
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.620]   as well as certain neurodegenerative conditions
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:00.920]   like Parkinson's, but other forms of dementia,
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.640]   as well as ADHD involve deficits in working memory
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.500]   and attention, which makes sense,
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:10.320]   given what we know about the symptoms of those conditions.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.760]   And that bromocriptine has been prescribed off-label
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.440]   for the treatment of those conditions
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.680]   to some degree of success.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.520]   However, those are off-label circumstances.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.540]   Right now, as far as I know,
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:23.160]   bromocriptine is not prescribed specifically
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.040]   for those conditions at a kind of whole population level.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.200]   It's not one of the drugs on the lookup table
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.560]   for ADHD or TBI, but certain well-informed neurologists
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.180]   and physicians do prescribe it for that reason.
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:36.500]   There are other dopamine agonists
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:37.840]   that are relevant in this context.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.840]   The ones that I think most of you will be familiar with
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:43.600]   are the drugs that increase dopamine and norepinephrine
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.720]   for the treatment of ADHD.
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.160]   And I did an entire episode of the Huberman Lab podcast
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.680]   about those compounds, things like Adderall,
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.760]   things like Ritalin, which by the way is quite different
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.120]   than Adderall in terms of how much dopamine
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:59.040]   relative to norepinephrine it causes the increase of.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.560]   I cover all that in those episodes.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.240]   And you can simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.120]   put ADHD, Adderall, or ADHD, Ritalin,
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.480]   and I talk about other things as well.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:10.040]   I also talk a little bit about Modafinil,
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.720]   which is a entirely different category of drug
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.400]   known to improve cognitive performance,
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.780]   in some cases in ADHD, but in everybody.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:18.720]   So there are a lot of different drugs
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.840]   that can improve working memory.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:24.660]   Most of those do so by increasing transmission of dopamine
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:26.060]   or availability of dopamine,
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:28.940]   somehow changing dopamine levels in the brain
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.220]   by increasing them.
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:32.080]   So if you're somebody that has challenges
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.240]   with working memory, focus, and attention,
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.000]   please see those episodes and please talk to your doctor
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.040]   about potentially using pharmacology to increase dopamine.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.400]   However, and this is very important,
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.120]   many people who have challenges with focus,
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.560]   attention, and working memory, and fall under the category
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.440]   of subclinical levels of ADHD,
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:54.740]   and even some individuals with ADHD, young and old,
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:57.920]   manage their symptoms and in some cases improve their focus
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.520]   through the use of behavioral tools, nutritional tools,
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.640]   supplement-based tools in ways that either allow them
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:07.000]   to reduce their total prescription drug dosages,
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.100]   and in some cases come off them entirely.
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.260]   Now, I am definitely not saying
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:13.220]   that people should come off those drugs entirely.
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.680]   And in fact, I want to take a really firm stand here
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.960]   'cause I know this is a bit controversial,
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.120]   but I'm just going to tell you,
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.520]   having evaluated the whole literature several times over now,
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.720]   I do think, I personally believe that there is a strong case
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.000]   for certain children and adults to take these compounds
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.680]   that increase dopamine and epinephrine.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.400]   Yes, those compounds are different forms of amphetamine,
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.920]   but those compounds we know can increase neuroplasticity,
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.220]   the rewiring, LTP, LTD, et cetera,
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:46.260]   within the neural circuits that control focus, attention,
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.260]   and working memory.
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:50.020]   And so they do have their place for certain individuals.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.500]   We don't want to rule those out.
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.400]   Are they over-prescribed?
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.700]   My feeling is that yes, they are probably over-prescribed.
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.260]   However, there are a number of individuals
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:00.280]   that strongly benefit from them as well.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:03.480]   So if you are going to explore the use of those compounds
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:05.160]   for sake of improving working memory,
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.980]   certainly if you're going to explore them
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:09.940]   for sake of improving working memory and focusing young kids,
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:12.780]   please, please, please talk to your physician
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:13.820]   because they're prescription drugs,
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.620]   you would need to talk to a physician anyway,
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:17.460]   but regardless of whether or not you're trying to improve
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.940]   focus and working memory in a child, in an adult,
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:22.780]   someone with TBI, someone with Parkinson's,
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:25.200]   I think it stands to reason that you would arrive
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:27.660]   to that conversation with some knowledge
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:29.620]   of not just the prescription drugs
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:30.820]   that are potentially available,
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:33.180]   but also some of the supplement-based tools,
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:34.980]   some of the behavioral tools,
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.900]   because as we know, and as a good friend of mine,
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:38.980]   who's an excellent physician,
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:40.780]   says better living through chemistry
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:42.260]   still requires better living,
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:45.180]   meaning yes, prescription drugs can have a positive impact
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.880]   on these aspects of brain function
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.080]   in a way that can really improve lives,
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.380]   but that behavioral tools also work.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:54.380]   In fact, they can collaborate in a very synergistic way
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:56.300]   to increase the amount of neuroplasticity
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:57.420]   in the relevant circuit.
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:58.700]   So I'm of the mind,
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:00.940]   and I think more and more people out there,
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:05.500]   I like to think are of the mind that behaviors, nutrition,
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.320]   supplement-based tools, and prescription drugs
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.900]   all can have their place to varying degrees,
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:13.540]   depending on the circumstances and the individual.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:15.500]   Okay, so today we talked about working memory,
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.600]   this incredible capacity of our brain.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.020]   In fact, a specific set of brain circuits
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:22.900]   designed for us to absorb information
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.840]   that is perceive it in our environment,
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:27.580]   use the relevant parts, and then chuck it,
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.460]   just get rid of it, forget it.
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:32.180]   So very different than short and long-term memory,
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.260]   which we also discussed,
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.740]   and we talked about a few of the mechanisms as well.
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:37.300]   I think you'll agree that working memory
[01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:40.380]   is one of the more incredible aspects to brain function.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:41.220]   I mean, if you think about it,
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:43.140]   this is a set of neural circuits
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:45.780]   that engage the same algorithm over and over
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:46.860]   in different contexts
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:49.340]   in order for us to be able to navigate new environments,
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:52.220]   familiar environments, to interleave different activities,
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:54.180]   different strategies, to task switch,
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:56.100]   to rule out distractors.
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:59.380]   It's oh so critical to every aspect of our waking life.
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:02.180]   And fortunately, there are also zero cost
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:04.780]   and low cost behavioral supplement-based
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.580]   and prescription drug approaches
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.700]   to improving this incredible thing we call working memory.
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:11.340]   So it was a pleasure to share some of those
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:13.060]   with you today as well.

[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.760]   I do read all the comments.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.140]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:44.900]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.040]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.080]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.420]   for things like improving sleep,
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:52.340]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:53.980]   To learn more about the supplements discussed
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:55.400]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.880]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:00.980]   So that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.020]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:05.620]   I am @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.420]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now called X,
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:09.920]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.500]   And on all of those platforms,
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.840]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.400]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.560]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.400]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.820]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:22.940]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:24.140]   If you haven't already subscribed
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:26.180]   to our monthly Neural Network Newsletter,
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:27.300]   the Neural Network Newsletter
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.260]   is a completely zero-cost newsletter
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:31.600]   that provides podcast summaries and protocols
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:34.500]   in the form of brief PDFs of one to three pages,
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.060]   in which I detail things like
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:37.720]   how to do deliberate cold exposure
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:39.300]   and some of the science behind it,
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.060]   how to regulate your dopamine levels,
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:43.460]   how to improve your sleep, and on and on.
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:45.340]   Everything from focus, neuroplasticity,
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:46.780]   and all of which is available, again,
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:49.820]   completely zero cost by going to HubermanLab.com,
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.140]   go to the Menu tab, scroll down to Newsletter,

[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:55.160]   And I want to emphasize
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.580]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.860]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:02.100]   about working memory and ways to improve
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:03.260]   your working memory.
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:05.300]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:07.300]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:09.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.460]   (upbeat music)
