[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   It never really crossed my mind that a side hustle
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.960]   could actually be something different than a business
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.200]   in the traditional sense.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.600]   I sat down with Kai from the Daily Churn podcast
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.140]   and we did an episode about making $3,000 a month
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.820]   from online deals and it totally changed my mind.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.880]   Sent me down a hundred different rabbit holes
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.920]   that I'm not even gonna go to right now.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.960]   But it just really opened my eyes
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.040]   that a side hustle doesn't have to be a business.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.520]   It could just be anything that generates extra money
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.760]   or reduces your costs.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.660]   Whether that's opening up a bonus with a bank account,
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.500]   a credit card.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.760]   Whether that's finding a way to get deals on meal kits
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.160]   to reduce your grocery costs.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.000]   Whether that's finding cell phone deals
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.320]   to reduce your cell phone bill.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.680]   Whether that's doing things like buying groups
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.560]   or gift cards or buying and selling gold,
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.200]   which is something that I did an episode on 206
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.400]   with Trey from Pure.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.080]   But the big takeaway here is that anything
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.400]   that generates income or reduces your spending
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.920]   is effectively a business or a side hustle.
