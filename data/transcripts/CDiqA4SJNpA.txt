[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   The following is a conversation with Robert Cruz,
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.440]   a historian at Stanford,
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.680]   specializing in the history of Afghanistan,
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.840]   Russia, and Islam.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.040]   This is the Alex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.960]   To support it,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.280]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.040]   And now, here's my conversation with Robert Cruz.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.120]   Was it a mistake for the United States
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.940]   to invade Afghanistan in 2001, 20 years ago?
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.480]   - Yes.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.720]   - As simple as yes, why was it a mistake?
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.720]   - I'm a historian, so I say this with some humility
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.120]   about what we can know.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.720]   I think I'd still like to know much more
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.880]   about what was going on in the White House,
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.200]   you know, in the hours, days, weeks, you know, after 9/11.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.360]   But I think the George W. Bush administration
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.040]   acted in a state of panic.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.100]   And I think they wanted to show kind of toughness.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.720]   They wanted to show some kind of resolve.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.040]   You know, this was a horrific act
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.320]   that played out, you know, on everyone's television screens.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.280]   And I think it was really a,
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.800]   fundamentally a crisis of legitimacy
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.440]   within the White House, within the Oval Office.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.760]   And I think they felt like they had to do
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.680]   something and something dramatic.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.920]   I think they didn't really think through, you know,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920]   who they were fighting, you know, who the enemy was,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.680]   what this geography had to do with 9/11.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.200]   I think looking back at it, I mean, some of us,
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.520]   not to say I was, you know, clairvoyant
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.840]   or could see into the future,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.360]   but I think many of us were, you know, from that morning,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.280]   skeptical about the connections that people were drawing
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.600]   between Afghanistan as a state, as a place,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200]   and the actions of Al-Qaeda in Washington
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.000]   and New York and Pennsylvania.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.920]   - So as you watch the events of 9/11,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.280]   the things that our leaders were saying
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.760]   in the minutes, hours, days, weeks that followed,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.760]   maybe you can give a little bit of a timeline
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.720]   of what was being said.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.400]   One was the actual invasion of Afghanistan,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   and also what were your feelings in the minutes, weeks,
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.400]   after 9/11?
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.040]   - I was in DC, I was, you know,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.760]   on the way to American University, hearing on NPR
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.360]   what had happened, and I thought of the
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.760]   American University logo, which is red, white, and blue.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.040]   It's an eagle, and I thought, you know,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.400]   Washington is under attack,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.640]   and symbols of American power are under attack.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.960]   And so, you know, I was quite concerned,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.720]   and at the time lived, you know,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.760]   just a few miles from the Capitol.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.360]   And so, you know, I felt that, you know, it was real.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.320]   So I appreciate the, you know,
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.240]   the sense of anxiety and fear and panic.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.320]   And four, two, three years later in DC,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.680]   we were constantly getting reports, you know,
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.800]   mostly rumors and unconfirmed about all kinds of attacks
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.640]   that would befall the city.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.200]   So I definitely appreciate the sense of being under assault.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.240]   But in watching television,
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.680]   including Russian television that day,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.200]   'cause I just installed a satellite thing,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.440]   so I was trying to watch world news
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.280]   and get different points of view,
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.640]   and that was quite useful to have
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.360]   an alternative, you know, set of eyes.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.200]   - In Russian?
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.360]   - Yeah, in Russian, yeah.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.480]   - Okay, so your Russian is good enough
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.160]   to understand Russian television.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   - The news, yeah, the news and the visuals
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.920]   that were coming that were not shown on American television.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.320]   I don't know how they had it, but they had,
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.360]   they were not filtering anything
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.120]   in the way that the major networks
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.520]   and cable televisions were doing here.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.920]   So it was a very unvarnished view
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.880]   of the violence of the moment, you know,
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.600]   in New York City of people diving from the towers
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.640]   and being, you know, and it was really,
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.480]   they didn't hold back on that,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.480]   which was quite, you know, fascinating.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.600]   Much of the world saw much more
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.920]   than actually the American public saw.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.240]   But to your question, you know,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.800]   amid that feeling of imminent doom,
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.880]   I watched commentators start to talk about Al-Qaeda
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.120]   and then talk about Afghanistan.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.920]   And one of the experts was Barnett Rubin,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.320]   who's at NYU, who's a, you know,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.600]   kind of long, very learned Afghanistan hand.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.480]   And he's brought on Peter Jennings on ABC News
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.800]   to kind of lay this out for everyone.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.320]   And I thought, you know, he did a fine job,
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.880]   but I think it was formative in cementing the view
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.120]   that somehow Al-Qaeda was synonymous
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000]   with this space, Afghanistan.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.200]   And I think, again, I was no Al-Qaeda expert then,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.160]   and I'm not now, but I think my immediate thought
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.720]   went to war, and because my background had been with,
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.800]   at that point, mostly Afghans who had been displaced
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.040]   from decades of war, whom I encountered in Uzbekistan,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.920]   who were refugees and so on,
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.880]   I thought immediately, you know, my mind went to
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.040]   the suffering of Afghan people,
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.560]   that this war was going to sweep up, of course,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.400]   the defenseless people who have nothing
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   to do with these politics.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.280]   - So we should give maybe a little bit of context
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.360]   that you can speak to.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.240]   - Yeah.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.000]   - So assume nobody's an expert at anything.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.840]   - Yeah.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.760]   - So let's just say you and I are not experts in anything.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.600]   - Right.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.400]   - What, as a historian, were you studying at the time
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.640]   and thinking about, see,
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.720]   is it the full global history of Afghanistan?
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.440]   Is it the region?
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.920]   Were you thinking about the Mujahideen
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.760]   and Al-Qaeda and Taliban?
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.200]   Were you thinking about the Soviet Union,
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.600]   the proxy war through Afghanistan?
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.080]   Were you thinking about Iraq and oil?
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.800]   Like, what's the full space of things in your heart,
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.360]   in your mind at the time?
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.400]   - I mean, just at the moment, of course, it was,
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   you know, there's the sense of, you know,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.440]   the suffering and the tragedy of the moment of the deaths.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.400]   And that was, I think, I was preoccupied
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.440]   by the violence of the moment.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.600]   But as the conversation turned to Afghanistan
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.360]   as a kind of theater, to somehow respond to this moment,
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.480]   I think immediately what came to mind was that
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.040]   little I knew about Al-Qaeda at the time suggested
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.160]   that the geography was inaccurate,
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.400]   that this was a global network, a global threat,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.840]   that this was a kind of, you know,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.280]   a movement that went beyond borders.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.600]   And I think that it felt early on that Afghanistan
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.560]   was gonna be used as a scapegoat.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.720]   And just intellectually at the time, you know,
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.040]   I was teaching at American University,
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.400]   my courses, you know, touched on a range of subjects,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   but I was trying to complete a book on Islam
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.280]   and the Russian Empire, actually.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.120]   But in doing that research, which took me across Russia
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.600]   and Central Asia, purely by accident,
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   I had developed an interest in Afghanistan
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.800]   because, just again, a series of coincidences,
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.320]   I found myself in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan,
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.000]   without housing, through an American friend
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.240]   who was like the king of the market in Tashkent.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.480]   He knew everyone, he ran into some Afghan merchants there.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.840]   They found out I didn't have a place to live.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.320]   I didn't know where Afghanistan was, honestly.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.400]   This was 1997.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.640]   I had a vague idea it was next door.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.240]   - Well, you lived in Uzbekistan?
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.040]   - Yeah, in Tashkent, doing dissertation research, yeah.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.880]   'Cause it was, you know,
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.400]   hub of the Russian Empire in Central Asia.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.240]   - Yeah.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.320]   - So just by accident, I ended up with these young Afghans
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.760]   who took me in as roommates.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.320]   And that, I think, the sense of that community
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.520]   shaped my idea of what Afghanistan is.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.200]   It was my first exposure to them.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.520]   They were part of a trading diaspora.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.520]   They brought, they had brought matches from Riga, Latvia.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.040]   They had somehow brought flour
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.840]   and some agricultural products from Egypt.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.560]   And they were sitting in enclosed containers in Tashkent,
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.200]   waiting for the Uzbekistani state to permit them to trade.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.960]   So these guys are mostly hanging out during the day.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.880]   They'll get dressed up.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.240]   They put on suits and ties, like you're wearing.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.560]   They'd polish their shoes.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   And they would sit around offices, drink tea, pistachios.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.320]   Then they'd feast at lunch.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.200]   And then at night, we would go out.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.840]   So part of my research,
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.240]   'cause I also had a bottleneck in my research.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.960]   I was going to the state archives in Tashkent.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.880]   And because of the state of Uzbekistan,
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.560]   you know, that was a very kind of suspicious thing to do.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.220]   So it took a while to get in.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.640]   So I had downtime in Tashkent, just like these guys.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.840]   So I got to know them pretty well.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.920]   And it was really just an accidental kind of thing,
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.640]   but grew quite close to them.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.440]   And I developed an appreciation of,
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.320]   which now I think, again, thinking of the seeds of all this,
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.800]   these people had already lived,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.280]   young guys, you know, in their 20s,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.880]   they'd already lived in 67 countries.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.080]   They all spoke half a dozen languages.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.120]   One of my best friends there had been a kickboxer
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.300]   and break dancer, trained in Tehran.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.300]   His father was a theater person in Afghanistan.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.500]   He told stories of escaping death in Afghanistan
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.940]   during the civil war,
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.660]   going to Uzbekistan, escaping death there.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.220]   And these were very, you know, real stories.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.980]   - Can you also just briefly mention,
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.380]   geographically speaking, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan,
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.900]   Tajikistan, you mentioned Iran.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.740]   Who are the neighbors of all of this?
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.300]   What are we supposed to be thinking about for people?
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.840]   I was always terrible at geography and spatial information.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.960]   So can you lay it out?
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.000]   - Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.320]   So Tashkent, you know, is the capital of Uzbekistan.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   It was a hub of Russian imperial power in the 19th century.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.480]   The Russians take the city from a local
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.400]   kind of Muslim dynasty in 1865.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.640]   It becomes the city,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.640]   the kind of hub of Soviet power in Central Asia after 1917.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   It becomes the center of the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan,
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.220]   which becomes independent finally in 1991
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.760]   when the Soviet Union collapses.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.040]   - So these are all like,
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:17.040]   these republics are the fingertips of Soviet power
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.460]   in Central Asia. - That's right.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.360]   That's right.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.400]   And they've been independent since 1991,
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.600]   but they have struggled to disentangle themselves
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.340]   from Moscow, from one another.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.400]   And now they face very serious pressure from China
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.940]   to form a kind of periphery of the great machine
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.280]   that is the Chinese economy
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.720]   and its ambitions to stretch across Asia.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.660]   For Afghanistan, where my roommates, my friends hailed from,
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.640]   Afghanistan had fallen into civil war in the late 1970s
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.720]   when leftists tried to seize power there in 1978.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.440]   The Soviet Union then extended from Uzbekistan,
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.640]   crossing the border with its forces in 1979
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.680]   to try to shore up this leftist government
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.400]   that had seized power in 1978.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.840]   And so for Central Asians in the wider region,
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.960]   their fate had for some decades been tied to Afghanistan
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.080]   in a variety of ways,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.400]   but it became much more connected in 1980s
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.320]   when Soviet Red Army occupied Afghanistan for 10 years.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.920]   And here I refer your listeners and viewers to "Rainbow Three"
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.640]   as the guide to--
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.120]   - The historically accurate guide.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.360]   - The historically accurate, the Bible.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.480]   The Bible of Afghan history in "Rainbow Three," yeah.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.600]   As a fantastic window onto the American view of the war.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.440]   Right?
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.840]   But for most Afghans,
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.160]   there are people who fought against the Soviet Army,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.700]   but of a certain generation,
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.880]   the guys I knew, their mission was to survive.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.080]   And so they fled in waves by the millions
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.700]   to Pakistan, to Iran.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.520]   Some went north into Soviet Central Asia later in the 1990s
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.220]   and some were displaced across the planet.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.960]   So California, where we're sitting today,
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.960]   has a large community that came in the '80s and '90s
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.720]   in the East Bay.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.120]   - Can I ask a quick question
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.720]   that's a little bit of a tangent?
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.960]   - Yeah.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.760]   - What is the correct or the respectful way
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.760]   to pronounce Afghanistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iran?
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.680]   So as a Russian speaker, Afghanistan.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.520]   - Yeah.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.480]   - Or the an versus the an.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.320]   - Yeah.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.760]   - Is it a different country by country?
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.200]   As an English speaker in America,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.420]   is it pretentious and disrespectful to say Afghanistan?
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.480]   Or is it the opposite, respectful to say it that way?
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.320]   What are your thoughts on this?
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.300]   - That's a fascinating question.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.240]   I defer to the people from those countries
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.640]   to of course sort out those politics.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.520]   I think one of the fascinating things
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.480]   about the region broadly
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.120]   is that it is a place of so many cultures
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.080]   and are really quite cosmopolitan.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.040]   So I think people are mostly quite forgiving
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.600]   about how you say Afghanistan, Afghanistan.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.880]   - It's not like Paris.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.720]   - Yeah, yeah, right, right.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.920]   - The French are not forgiving.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.120]   - No, no, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.720]   No, I think people are very, very forgiving.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   And I think that Iranians are a bit more instructive
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.120]   in suggesting Iran rather than Iran, right?
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.160]   Iraq, Iraq.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.040]   I think there's come to be a fit
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.560]   between certain ways of pronouncing these places
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.080]   and the position that Americans take about them, right?
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.080]   So it's more jarring when people say Iraq
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.360]   and it comes with a claim that a certain kind of person
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.880]   should be the victim of violence or, right?
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.720]   - It's fascinating.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.120]   It's kind of like talking about the Democratic Party
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.520]   or the Democrat Party.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.780]   It's sometimes using certain kind of terminology
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.780]   to make a little bit of a sort of implied statement
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.760]   about your beliefs.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.600]   It's fascinating.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.720]   - Yeah, I mean, I think when I hear Iraq and Iran,
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.920]   I mean, I think it, yeah, is it intentional
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.360]   in the case of a Democrat or is it just a,
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.200]   you know, and it's a whatever.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.000]   I think, again, I think most Iranians and Afghans
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.960]   people I know have been very cool about that.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.520]   What annoys Afghans now, I can say,
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.360]   I think it's fair to say,
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.440]   I don't mean to speak for millions of people,
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.160]   for a group of people,
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.320]   but I can just share with our non-Afghan friends,
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.660]   the term Afghani is a kind of term of offense
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:29.980]   because that's the name of the currency.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.460]   And so lots of people ask, you know, why having,
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.660]   especially, again, it's more directed at Americans
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.460]   because, you know, we've been so deeply involved
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.020]   in that country, obviously, for the last 20 years, right?
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.420]   So Afghans ask why after 20 years
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.380]   are you still calling us the wrong name?
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.700]   - What is the right name?
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.540]   - They prefer Afghans.
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.380]   - Afghans.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.180]   - Yeah, and Afghani is the name of the currency.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.020]   And so--
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.740]   - I just dodged a bullet 'cause I was gonna say--
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.100]   - That's cool, no, no, yeah, I hear you.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.300]   - It's really great to know.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.420]   - Yeah, yeah, and it's, again, I think,
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.260]   but I would emphasize that people are quite open
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.220]   and, you know, it's a whole region of incredible diversity
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.820]   and respect for linguistic pluralism, actually.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.500]   So I think that, you know, but I also appreciate that
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.660]   during, in this context, when there's a lot of pain,
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.880]   you know, in the Afghan diaspora community in particular,
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.040]   you know, being called the wrong name after 20 years,
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.840]   when they already feel so betrayed at this moment,
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.020]   you know, just kind of, if one follows us on social media,
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.180]   that is one kind of hot wire, right?
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.460]   - Yeah, so the reason I ask about pronunciation
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.260]   is because, yes, it is true that there are certain things
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.220]   when mispronounced kind of reveal
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.580]   that you don't care enough to pronounce correctly,
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.100]   you don't know enough to pronounce correctly,
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.820]   and you dismiss the culture and the people,
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.260]   which I think, as per your writing,
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.260]   is something that, if it's okay, I'll go with Afghanistan,
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.540]   just because I'm used to it.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.620]   I say Iraq, Iran, but I say Afghanistan.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.940]   - Yeah, yeah, it's great.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.140]   - As you do in your writing, Afghanistan suffers
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.700]   from much misunderstanding from the rest of the world.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.700]   But back to our discussion of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.660]   the whole region that gives us context
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.940]   for the events of 9/11.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.380]   - Right, right.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.660]   So yeah, if we go back to that day and the weeks
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.500]   that followed, my mind went to the community
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.580]   I knew in Tashkent, which is interesting.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.860]   It was, I mean, they were, so Islam was the focal point
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.100]   of our conversation in the US about 9/11, right?
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.340]   Everyone wanted to know what was the relationship
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.900]   between the Serbic violence and that religious tradition
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.900]   with its 1 billion plus followers across the globe, right?
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.020]   That became the issue, of course,
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.420]   for American security institutions,
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.460]   for local state and police institutions, right?
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.620]   I mean, it became the, I think it was the question
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.700]   that most Americans had on their mind.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.820]   So again, I didn't imagine myself as someone
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.880]   who had all the answers, of course,
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.680]   but given my background and coming at this
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.900]   from Russian history, coming at this from studying empire
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.100]   and trying to think about the region broadly,
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.780]   you know, I was very alarmed
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.900]   at the way that the conversation went.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.940]   - Can I ask you a question? - Yeah.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.940]   - What was your feeling on that morning of 9/11?
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.300]   Who did this?
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.540]   Isn't that a natural feeling?
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.660]   It's coupled with fear of what's next,
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.180]   especially when you're in DC. - Right, yeah.
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.700]   - But also, who is this?
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.340]   Is this an accident? - Yeah.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.060]   - Is this a deliberate terrorist attack?
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.980]   Is this domestic? - Yeah.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.460]   - What were your thoughts of the options
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.060]   and the internal ranking given your expertise?
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.100]   - I mean, I suppose I was taken by the narrative
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.460]   that this was international.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.980]   I mean, I'd also lived in New York
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.780]   during one of the first bombings in '94
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.260]   of the World Trade Center.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.980]   So it was clear to me that a radical community
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.300]   had really fixed New York as part of their imagination of,
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.660]   and I immediately thought it was a kind of
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.340]   blow to American power.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.860]   And I was drawn by the symbolism of it.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.740]   If you think of it as an act,
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.180]   it was a kind of an act of speech, if you will,
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.900]   a kind of a way of speaking to,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.620]   from a position of relative weakness,
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.540]   speaking to an imperial power.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.820]   And I saw it as a kind of symbolic speech act of that
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.020]   with horrific real world consequences
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.580]   for all the citizens, victims, for the firemen,
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.620]   the police, and just the horror of the moment.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.740]   So I did see it as transcending the United States,
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.900]   but I did not see it as really having anything necessarily
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.460]   to do fundamentally about Afghanistan
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.060]   and the history of the region that I'd been studying
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.860]   and the community people that I knew
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.980]   who were not particularly religious, right?
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.300]   The guys I hung out with actually wore me out
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.220]   because they wanted to go out every night.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.740]   They wanted to party every night.
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.580]   - Drinking?
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.420]   - Yep.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.620]   We had discussions about alcohol.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.660]   I mean, Uzbekistan is famous for its--
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.500]   - Drinking.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.340]   - Its drinking.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.160]   You know, it's--
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.000]   - That's something to look forward to.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.420]   So I do wanna travel to that part of the world.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.380]   When was the last time you were in that part of the world?
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.780]   - Early 2000s.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.900]   Well, in the mid 2000s, 2010s.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.980]   - So wait, so by the way, what drinking?
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:17.820]   Vodka?
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.120]   What's the weapon of choice?
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.180]   - Uzbekistan has incorporated vodka as the choice.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.340]   And it informs, you know, and it's,
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.620]   but the fascinating thing, you know,
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.540]   as a student is what you're observing as a non-Muslim,
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.500]   you know, I'm a non-Russian.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.860]   This is all, you know, culturally new to me.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.820]   And I'm, you know, a student of all that, right?
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.540]   As a graduate student, doing my work there.
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.300]   - So you're like the Jane Goodall of vodka and Russia.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.140]   - That's right.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:46.960]   - Just observing.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.800]   - That's right.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.640]   - And studying.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.460]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.300]   And then you get the Samogon, the grass vodka.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.400]   You get, you know, I have,
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.700]   I've had some long nights on the Kazakhstan frontier
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.240]   that I'm not proud of.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.840]   (laughing)
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.660]   You know.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.500]   - But you got to know the people
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.040]   and some of them from Kazakhstan.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:03.880]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.960]   But intellectually, so the thing,
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.800]   I mean, the fascinating thing there was that,
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.240]   and just as a, I mean, there's a whole,
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.080]   you know, I'm a historian, right?
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.440]   But there are great contributions by, you know,
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.600]   anthropologists and ethnographers
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.960]   who've gone across the planet
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.440]   and tried to understand how Muslims
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.600]   understand the tradition in different contexts.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.340]   So many Uzbeks will say, you know,
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.200]   this is part of our national culture
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.760]   to drink and eat as we please, right?
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.600]   And yet I'm a very devout Muslim.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.960]   And so, of course, you can encounter
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.420]   other Muslim communities who won't touch alcohol, right?
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.120]   But it's become kind of, I think it's very much,
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.360]   you know, Soviet culture left a deep impression
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.200]   in each of these places.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.360]   And so there are ways of thinking,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.360]   ways of performing, ways of, you know,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.280]   enjoying oneself that are shared across Soviet
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.640]   and former Soviet space to this day, right?
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.240]   - And you've written also about Muslims
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.280]   in the Soviet Union. - That's right.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.320]   - There's an article that, there was a paywall,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.160]   so I couldn't read it.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.960]   And I really wanna read it.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.920]   Is-- - I'll be sure to share
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.760]   with you, yeah.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.320]   - Moscow and the mosque or something like that.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.880]   - Right, right.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.280]   - By the way, just another tangent on a tangent.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.120]   - Yeah.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.320]   - So I bought all your books.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.160]   I love 'em very much. - Thank you, thank you.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.080]   - One of the reasons I bought them
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.360]   and read many parts is because they're easy to buy.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.920]   Unlike articles, every single website has a paywall.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.440]   - So it's very-- - I hear you, I'm sorry.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.720]   - Very frustrating to read brilliant scholars
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.320]   such as yourself. - No, no, no.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.520]   - I wish there was one fee I could pay everywhere.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.840]   I don't care what that fee is.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.160]   - Right, right. - Where it gives,
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.240]   allows me to read some of your brilliant writing.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.080]   - No, no, thank you, I hear you.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.360]   No, I think moving toward more kind of open source
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.160]   formatting stuff, I think is what a lot of journals
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.040]   are thinking about now.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.200]   And I think it's definitely for the kind of democratization
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.560]   of knowledge and scholarship,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.960]   that's definitely an important thing
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.920]   that we should all think about.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.400]   And I think we need to exert pressure
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.040]   on these publishers to do that.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.880]   So I appreciate that. - This is what I'm doing here.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.720]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.520]   Yeah, no, I appreciate it, appreciate it.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   - So your thought was Afghanistan is not going to be
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.960]   the center, the source of where--
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.080]   - It's not the center of this,
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.080]   and invading that country isn't gonna fix the toxic
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.240]   milestone of politics that produced 9/11, right?
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.560]   I think I'm just thinking of some of the personalities,
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.920]   just thinking about going back to the Tajikistan story,
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.840]   which I'll end with.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.080]   I mean, just observing real Muslims doing things,
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.400]   and then asking questions about it,
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.040]   and trying to understand through their eyes
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.960]   what the tradition means to them.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.720]   And then we had a very narrow conversation
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.920]   about what Islam is that generated,
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.140]   immediately exploded on the day of 9/11, right?
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.080]   And then, of course, I think the antipathy
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.000]   toward Islam and Muslims was informed by racism,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.920]   informed by xenophobia.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.000]   So it became a perfect storm, I think, of demonization
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.200]   that didn't sit with what I knew about the tradition,
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.380]   and with the actual people that I had known.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.360]   'Cause then going back to, I mean,
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.880]   there were other friends and encounters and so on,
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.320]   but just thinking about Afghanistan
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.360]   and Tajikistan for a moment, I mean,
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.360]   just thought about my friends who had been,
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.600]   who had suffered a great deal in their short lives,
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.680]   who had been cast aside from country to country,
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   but had found a place in Tajikistan
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.680]   with some relative stability.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.020]   And they wanted to go out every night.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.480]   And they explained, one friend,
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.840]   we talked about it with the alcohol and all that,
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.260]   and he didn't get crazy, but he was like,
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.860]   "You can drink, but just don't get drunk.
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.400]   "That's permissible within Islam," right?
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.040]   And he was ethnic Pashtun.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.800]   Ethnic Uzbeks had a different view.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.920]   Often, the more vodka, the better,
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   and it doesn't violate, as I understand, Islam.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.160]   So even, it's kind of a silly example,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.240]   but it's just an illustration of the ways
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.060]   in which different communities, different generations,
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.360]   different people can come at this very complex,
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.560]   rich tradition in so many different ways.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.200]   So obviously, whatever kind of scholar you are,
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.280]   any kind of expert, whatever,
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.840]   it's always disconcerting to see
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.760]   your field of specialization be flattened, right?
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.000]   And then be flattened and then be turned to arguments
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.400]   for violence, right?
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.800]   - Mixed up with the natural human feelings of hate
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.440]   and depression. - And hurt, in pain.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.040]   So I mean, that day, I vividly remember,
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.760]   I sat with other PhD historians in different fields.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.720]   We, oddly enough, had lunch that day,
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.280]   and it kind of deserted Washington.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.720]   Some place was open, we went.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.480]   And we just thought, this is gonna kind of open up
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.780]   like a great mall of destruction.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.780]   And the American state is going to destroy,
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.760]   and it's gonna destroy in this geography.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.520]   And I thought that was misplaced for lots of reasons.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.360]   And then I think if one,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.520]   you know, I'd been doing some research on Afghanistan then,
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.600]   I was kind of shifting to the South,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.000]   and I'd been looking at the Taliban from afar
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.840]   for some years.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.520]   And I think it's clear now that in retrospect,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.360]   there were opportunities for alternative policies
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.580]   at that moment.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.940]   - So what should the conversation have been like?
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.580]   What should we have done differently?
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:28.580]   Because, you know, from a perspective of the time,
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:33.460]   the United States was invaded by a foreign force.
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.140]   What is the proper response,
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.780]   or what is the proper conversation
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.100]   about the proper response at the time, you think?
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.340]   - You know, I know my colleague at Stanford,
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.660]   Connally Sirais, would tell me this is above my pay grade.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.660]   And, you know, she makes a point in her classes
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.260]   to talk about how difficult decision-making is
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.220]   under such intense pressure.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.920]   And I appreciate that.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.420]   You know, I am an historian who sits safely in my office.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.740]   I don't like battlefields.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.460]   I don't like taking risks.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.980]   So I concede all those limits.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.300]   You know, I'm not a military expert.
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.220]   I've been accused of being a spy wherever I've gone
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.040]   because of the way I look
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.320]   and because of my nationality and so on, but not a spy.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.740]   So I defer, you know,
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.720]   I respect the expertise of all those communities.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.980]   But I think they acted out of ignorance.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.500]   They acted, I think, because, I mean,
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.980]   if you think of the, in a way,
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.860]   there was a compensatory aspect of this decision-making.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.580]   I mean, the Bush administration failed.
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.580]   This was an extraordinary failure, right?
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.700]   So if we start- - In which way?
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.540]   If we're gonna break down the-
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.740]   - A failure of intelligence.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.620]   I mean, if you follow the story of Richard Clark-
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.820]   - Who's Richard Clark?
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.840]   - He was a national security expert
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.420]   who was tasked with following Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.300]   Who had produced a dossier
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.260]   under the Clinton administration
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.700]   that he passed on to the George W. Bush administration.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.420]   And if you look at the work of Connie Lisa Rice,
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.560]   she wrote a very famous, I think,
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.700]   unpaywalled foreign affairs article that you can read
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.820]   announcing the George W. Bush foreign policy kind of outlook.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.260]   And it was all about great powers.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.460]   It was about the rise of China.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.520]   It was about Russia.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.940]   I mean, there's definitely a kind of hangover
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:15.940]   of those who missed having Russia as the boogeyman
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.420]   who spoke, the Clinton administration repeated again and again
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.840]   the idea of making sure the bear stayed in his cage.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.980]   Which is why the United States
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.260]   threw a lifeline to the Central Asian states
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.140]   hoping to have pipelines,
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.620]   hoping to shore up their national sovereignty
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:38.220]   as a way of containing Russia initially,
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.220]   but also Iran, which sits to the south and west.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.860]   And then peripherally looking down the road
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.660]   to China to the east.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.260]   - So the bear is what, like Russia?
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.220]   Or is it kind of like some weird combination
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.380]   of Russia, Iran, and China?
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.340]   - The bear is Russia.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.200]   And Russia is this,
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.780]   I'm trying to characterize the imagination
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.880]   of some of these national security figures.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.280]   This is an image formed in the Cold War.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.500]   I mean, it has deeper seeds in European
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.220]   and Western intellectual thought that go back
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:17.220]   at least to the 1850s in the reign of Czar Nicholas I.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.180]   When we first get this language about the Russian Empire
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.980]   is this kind of evil polity.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.080]   Obviously this was a kind of pillar of Reaganism,
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.020]   but the Clinton folks kept that alive.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.060]   They wanted to make sure that American power
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.100]   would be unmatched.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.420]   And they being creatures of the Cold War themselves,
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.880]   they look to Russia as a resurgent power
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.540]   well before Putin was even thought of.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.440]   - Yeah, I mean, this is, you mentioned one deep,
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.160]   profound historical piece in Rambo.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.680]   It's probably, this conflict has to do
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   with another Celeste Stallone movie, "Rocky IV,"
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.560]   which is also historically accurate
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.560]   and based on, it's basically a documentary.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.460]   So there is something about the American power,
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.180]   even at the level of Condoleezza Rice,
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:15.180]   these respected deep kind of leaders and thinkers
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.600]   about history and the future,
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.220]   where they like to have competition with other superpowers
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.560]   and almost conjure up superpowers,
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.300]   even when those countries don't maybe at the time
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.540]   at least deserve the label of superpower.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.420]   - That's right, great point.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.820]   Yeah, they're all excellent points.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.460]   So yeah, I mean, Russia was, I think many experts,
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.480]   I mean, my mentor at Princeton, Stephen Kakin,
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.380]   was then writing great things about how,
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:49.620]   if you look at Russia's economy, the scale of its GDP,
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.280]   its capacity to actually act globally,
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.220]   it's all quite limited.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.700]   But Condoleezza Rice and the people around her
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.100]   came into power with George W. Bush,
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.620]   thinking that the foreign policy challenges of her era
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.540]   would be those of the past.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.180]   Richard Clarke and others within the administration
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.500]   warned that, in fact, there is this group
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.980]   that has declared war against the United States
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.820]   and they are coming for us.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.320]   The FBI had been following these people around
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.160]   for many months.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.900]   And so by the time George W. Bush comes to power,
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.820]   lots of Al-Qaeda activists, well, not lots,
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.180]   but perhaps a dozen or so,
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.720]   are already training in the United States.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.820]   And what we knew immediately from the biographies
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.460]   of some of the characters of the attackers of 9/11,
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.140]   it was a hodgepodge of people from across the planet,
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.380]   but most of them were Saudi, right?
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.260]   And that was known very early on,
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.260]   or presumed very early on.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.540]   So again, if we go back to your big question
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.300]   about the geography, why Afghanistan, it didn't add up.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.260]   It seemed to me that Afghanistan was a kind of soft target.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.140]   It was a place to have explosions,
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.400]   to seemingly recapture American supremacy.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.500]   And also I think, in many quarters,
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.700]   there was a deep urge for revenge.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.460]   And this was a place to have some casualties,
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.520]   have some explosions.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.780]   And then I think, restore the legitimacy
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.380]   of the Bush administration
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.100]   by showing that we're in charge, we'll pay.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.500]   I think that was a very old fashioned punitive dimension,
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.300]   which rests upon the presumption
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.620]   that if we intimidate these people,
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.860]   they'll know not to try this again, right?
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.660]   All these, I would suggest, are all misreadings
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.380]   of an organization that was always global.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.680]   It had no real center.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.660]   I mean, it called itself the center,
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.880]   that's one way to translate Al-Qaeda.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.540]   But that center was really in the imagination.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.260]   Bin Laden bounced around from country to country.
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.740]   And crucially, I think a dimension
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.220]   that I don't claim to know anything new about,
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.900]   but has endured as a kind of doubt,
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.100]   is the role of Saudi Arabia,
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.740]   and the fact that the muscle in that operation of 9/11
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.000]   was Saudi, right?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.500]   I mean, this was a Saudi operation with,
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.380]   if one thinks again, just on the basis of nationalities,
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.440]   Saudis, an Egyptian or two, a Lebanese guy,
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.660]   and the Egyptian guy had been studying in Germany.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.980]   He was an urban planner, right?
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.340]   So if one thinks of the imagination of this,
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.740]   I mean, and if you look at the kind of typology
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.460]   of the figures who have led this radical movement,
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.020]   I mean, if you think of the global jihadists,
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.460]   they are mostly not religious scholars, right?
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.660]   Bin Laden was not a religious scholar.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.420]   His training was an engineer.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.100]   Some biographers claim that he was a playboy
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.620]   for much of his youth.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.660]   But really, these ideas,
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.580]   I think that's probably why they chose the Twin Towers.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.380]   I mean, this is an imagination
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.860]   fueled by training and engineering.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.380]   I mean, a lot of the sociology,
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.540]   if you do a kind of post-pacography
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.780]   of a lot of these leading jihadists,
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.180]   their backgrounds are not in Islamic scholarship,
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.500]   but actually in engineering
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.140]   and kind of practical sciences and professions.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.240]   Medical doctors are among their ranks.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.980]   And so there's long been a tension between Islamic scholars
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.300]   who devote their whole lives to study of texts
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.980]   and commentary and interpretation,
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.620]   and then what some scholars call kind of new intellectuals,
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.340]   new Muslim authorities,
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.060]   who actually have secular university educations,
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.820]   often in the natural sciences or engineering
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.180]   and technical fields,
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.520]   who then bring that kind of mindset, if you will,
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.740]   to what Muslim scholars call the religious sciences,
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:31.740]   which are a field of kind of ambiguity and of gradation
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.900]   and of subtlety and nuance
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.500]   and really of decades of training
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.820]   before one becomes authoritative to speak about issues
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.220]   like whether or not it's legitimate
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.260]   to take someone else's life.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:47.420]   - With the relation to Afghanistan, who was bin Laden?
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.320]   - Bin Laden was a visitor.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.720]   If you look at his whole life course,
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.000]   part of it is an enigma still.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.920]   He is from a Saudi elite family,
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.220]   but a family that kind of has a Yemeni,
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.080]   Arabian Sea kind of genealogy.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.140]   So the family has no relationship
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.880]   to Afghanistan past or present,
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.560]   except at some point in 1980s,
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.960]   when he went like thousands of other young Saudis,
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.100]   first to Pakistan, to places like Peshawar on the border,
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.720]   where they wanted to aid the jihad in some capacity.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.160]   And for the most part, the Arabs who went
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.140]   opened up hospitals, some opened up schools.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.020]   The bin Laden family had long been
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.360]   based in engineering construction.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.420]   So it's thought that he used some of those skills
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.460]   and resources and connections to build things.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:48.280]   We have images of him firing a gun for show, right?
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.600]   It's not clear that he ever actually fired a gun
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.220]   in what we would call combat.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.460]   Again, I could be corrected by this.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.600]   And I think there are competing accounts of who he was.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.280]   So he's kind of a, I mean,
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.280]   many of these figures who sit at the pinnacle of this world
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:07.120]   are fictive heroes that people map
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.400]   their aspirations onto, right?
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.400]   And so people like Mullah Omar,
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.280]   who was then head of the Taliban,
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.900]   was rarely seen in public.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.680]   The current head of the Taliban
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.460]   is almost never seen in public.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.220]   I mean, there's a kind of studied era of mystery
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.340]   that they've cultivated to make themselves available
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.700]   for all kinds of fantasies, right?
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:32.020]   - Do you think he believed, so his religious beliefs,
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:38.700]   do you think he believed some of the more extreme things
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.300]   that enable him to commit terrorist acts?
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.000]   Maybe put another way,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.960]   what makes a man want to become a terrorist?
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.760]   And what aspect of bin Laden
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.420]   made him want to be a terrorist?
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.500]   - Right, right.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.100]   I mean, let me offer some observations.
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.040]   I think there are others who know more about bin Laden
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.600]   and have far more expertise in al-Qaeda.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.340]   So I'm coming at this in an adjacent way,
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.500]   kind of from Afghanistan and from my historical training.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.820]   So this is my two cents, so bear with me.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.680]   I don't have the authoritative account.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.060]   - Which in itself is fascinating
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.060]   because you're a historian of Afghanistan
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.180]   and the fact that bin Laden isn't a huge part
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.820]   of your focus of study just means that bin Laden
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.700]   is not a key part of the history of Afghanistan,
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.020]   except that America made him a key part
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.340]   of the history of Afghanistan.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.580]   - I would endorse that, definitely.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.320]   That's it, I mean, you put it in a very pity way.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.540]   Yeah, so listen, he was, so he was an engineer.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.580]   He was said to be a playboy.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.180]   He spent a lot of cash from his family.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.940]   You know, like many young Saudis
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.280]   and from some other countries,
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.600]   he was inspired by this idea
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.800]   that there was jihad in Afghanistan.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.860]   It was gonna take down one of the two superpowers,
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.700]   the Soviet Union, who, you know,
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.740]   the Red Army did murder hundreds of thousands,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.700]   perhaps as many as 2 million Afghan civilians
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.860]   during that conflict.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:12.460]   It's very, you know, plausible and very, you know,
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.900]   completely understandable that many young people
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.660]   would see that cause as, you know,
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.820]   the righteous, pious fighters for jihad
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.900]   who call themselves Mujahideen,
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.460]   arrayed against this evil empire, right,
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.260]   of a godless Soviet empire that,
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.980]   I mean, there's even confusion about what the Soviets wanted.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.660]   Right, now we know much more about, like,
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.260]   what the Kremlin wanted, what Brezhnev wanted,
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.580]   and how the Soviet elite thought about it
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.260]   because we have many more of their records.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.060]   But from the outside, you know, for Jimmy Carter
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.740]   and for Reagan, it looked like the Soviets
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.940]   were making a move on South Asia
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.820]   because they wanted to get to the warm water ports,
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.700]   you know, which Russians always want, supposedly, right?
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.140]   And it was kind of a move to take over our oil
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.800]   and, you know, to assert world domination, right?
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.500]   So there are lots of ways in which this looked like
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.700]   good versus evil.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.940]   In Congress, it looked like, you know,
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.700]   kind of Vietnam again, but this time,
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.960]   this is our chance to get them.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.420]   And there are lots of great quotes.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.940]   I mean, disturbing, but really revealing quotes
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.340]   that American Postal Workers made about
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.020]   wanting to give the Soviets their Vietnam.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.620]   So the CIA funneled, you know,
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.260]   hundreds of millions of dollars into this project
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.700]   to back the Mujahideen, you know,
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.620]   who Reagan called freedom fighters.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.500]   And so, Bin Laden was part of that universe.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.340]   He's part of that, you know,
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.540]   he's swimming in the ocean of these Afghan Mujahideen
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.780]   who out of size, you know, did 95% of the fighting.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:37.780]   They're the ones who died.
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.540]   They're the ones who defeated the Red Army, right?
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.140]   The Arabs who were there did a little fighting,
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.740]   but a lot of it was for, you know, their purposes.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.100]   It was to get experience.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.260]   It was to kind of create their reputations.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.620]   Like Bin Laden began to forge for himself
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.220]   of being spokesman for a global project.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.820]   Because by the late 80s, when Bin Laden,
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.500]   I think was more active and began conspiring
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.820]   with people from other Arab countries,
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.980]   the idea that, you know, Gorbachev came to power in '85.
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.060]   He's like, let's get out of here.
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.340]   This is draining the Soviet budget.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.460]   It's an embarrassment.
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.220]   We didn't think about this properly.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.260]   Let's focus on restoring the party
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.340]   and strengthening the Soviet Union.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.700]   Let's get out of this costly war.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.580]   You know, it's a waste.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.820]   It's not worth it.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.900]   We don't lose anything by getting out of Afghanistan.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:31.900]   And so their retreat was quite effective and successful
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.140]   from the Soviet point of view, right?
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.180]   It's not what we're seeing now.
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.340]   - What year was the retreat?
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.620]   - I mean, it began, so Mikhail Gorbachev came to power
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.820]   in '85, you know, he was a generation younger
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.580]   than the other guys.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.340]   He was a critic of the system.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.180]   He didn't wanna abolish it.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.580]   He wanted to reform it.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.380]   He was a true believer in Soviet socialism
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.620]   and the party as a monopolist, right?
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.020]   But he was critical of the old guard
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.940]   and recognized that the party had to change
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.660]   and the whole system had to change to continue to compete.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.460]   And so Afghanistan was one element of this.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:12.460]   And so he pushed the Afghan elites that Moscow was backing
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.380]   to basically say, listen, we're gonna share power.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:19.700]   And so a figure named Najibullah,
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.340]   who was a Soviet trained intelligence specialist
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.460]   sitting in Kabul, agreed.
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:30.340]   And he said, we need to have a more kind of pluralistic
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.260]   accommodations approach to our enemies
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.300]   who are backed by the US mainly,
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.220]   sitting in Pakistan, sitting in Iran,
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.580]   backed by these Arabs to a degree,
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.380]   getting money from Saudi.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.140]   And he said, let's draw some of them into the government
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.460]   and basically have a kind of unity government
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.860]   that would make some space for the opposition.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.380]   And for the most part, with US backing,
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.060]   with Pakistani backing, with Iranian backing,
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.580]   and with Saudi backing, the opposition said, no,
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.740]   we're not going to reconcile.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.740]   We're gonna push you off the cliff.
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.700]   And so that story goes on from at least 1987.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.180]   The last Soviet Red Army troops leave early 1989.
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:15.260]   But the Najibullah government holds on for three more years.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.100]   It is the, I mean,
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.780]   they're still getting some help from the Soviet Union.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.700]   Its enemies are still getting help from the US mainly.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.700]   And it's not until '92 that they lose.
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.580]   And then Mujahideen come to power.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:33.100]   They immediately, they're deeply fractured.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.980]   - And that's where bin Laden is watching all of this unroll.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.820]   - That's right.
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.900]   And he's part of the mix, but he's also mobile.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.140]   So he at one point goes, is in Sudan.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.100]   He's moving from place to place.
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.260]   His people are all over the world.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.220]   In fact, they, I mean, if you think of the,
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.220]   once the Mujahideen take power,
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.140]   they have difficulties with Arab fighters too.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.260]   And they don't want them coming in and messing with,
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.180]   Mujahideen regard this as like,
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.380]   this is an Afghan national state that we're gonna build.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.220]   It's gonna be Islamic.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.660]   It's gonna be an Islamic state,
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.780]   but you can't interfere with us.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.700]   And so there are always tensions.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.060]   And so the Arabs are always kind of,
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.460]   I would say they were,
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.360]   Arab fighters were always interlopers.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.900]   Yes, the Afghans are happy to take their money,
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.500]   send patients to their hospitals, take their weapons,
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.740]   but they're never gonna let this be like a Saudi
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.760]   or Egyptian or whatever project.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.380]   But then many of those fighters went home.
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.500]   They went back to Syria.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.180]   They went back to Egypt.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.620]   Some wanted to go back to Saudi Arabia,
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:31.660]   but the Saudis were very careful.
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.240]   I mean, the Saudis always used Afghanistan
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.900]   as a kind of safety valve.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.220]   In fact, they had fundraisers on television.
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.460]   They chartered jets.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.380]   They filled them with people to fly to Pakistan,
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.380]   get out in the shower and say, go fight.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.420]   And it was one way that the monarchy,
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:50.160]   the Saudi monarchy, very cleverly, I think,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.700]   created a kind of escape valve
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.460]   for would-be dissidents in Saudi Arabia, right?
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.920]   Just send them abroad.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.320]   You wanna fight Jihad?
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.180]   Go do that somewhere else.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.300]   Don't bother the kingdom.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.460]   But all this became dicier in the early '90s
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.340]   when some of these guys came back home
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.380]   and some of the scholars around them said,
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.180]   let's, we've defeated the Soviet Union,
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.260]   which is a huge, huge boost.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.860]   I think part of the dynamic we see today
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:17.420]   is that the Taliban victory is a renewed inspiration
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.300]   for people who think, look, we beat the Soviets.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.020]   Now we beat the Americans.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.620]   And so already watching the Soviet retreat
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.980]   across this bridge back into Uzbekistan,
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:30.360]   if you see these dramatic images of the tanks moving,
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.480]   a lot of people interpreted this as like,
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.720]   we are going to change the world
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.560]   and now we're turning to the Americans.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.280]   And our local national governments
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.840]   are backed by the Americans.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.100]   So let's start with those places.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.880]   And then let's go strike the belly of the beast,
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.360]   which is America, which is New York.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.200]   And going back to Bin Laden,
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.760]   your question about what motivates him, what motivated him,
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.760]   again, he was not a rigorously trained Islamic scholar.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:00.580]   And that, I think, when this comes up in our classes,
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.980]   I think, especially young people,
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.140]   I mean, people who weren't even born in 9/11,
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:03.980]   I mean, they're shocked.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.440]   They see his appearance.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   They see him pictured in front of a giant bookshelf
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.880]   of Arabic books.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.500]   He's got the Kalashnikov.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.620]   He's got what looks like a religious scholar's library
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.980]   behind him, right?
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:20.060]   But if you look at his words, I mean,
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.500]   one fascinating thing about just our politics
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:22.680]   and just one thing that kind of sums all this up,
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.180]   I mean, the fact that on 9/11,
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:29.740]   we had to have a few people, a few experts,
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.140]   people like Bernard Rubin, who was an Afghanistan expert.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.780]   So that was one way in which I think,
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.240]   I'm not faulting him personally,
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.500]   but it's just one way in which that relationship
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.340]   appeared to be formed, right,
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.600]   of linking Afghanistan to that moment.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:47.380]   If one looks actually at what Bin Laden was saying and doing,
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.340]   people like Richard Clarke were studying this.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.320]   There were Arab leaders.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.920]   The Arab press was watching this
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.040]   because he gave some of his first interviews
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.060]   to a few Arab newspaper outlets.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:01.060]   But speaking of our American kind of monolingualism,
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.660]   a lot of what he was saying wasn't known.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.560]   And so I think for several years,
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.420]   people weren't reading what Bin Laden said.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.940]   I mean, experts are reading it in Arabic,
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.420]   but there was great anxiety around translating his works.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.500]   So we have Mein Kampf, we have all this other stuff.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.900]   You can buy the collected works of Lenin, Stalin, Mao,
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.140]   whatever you want in whatever language you want.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.060]   But Bin Laden was taboo for American publishing.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.220]   And so it was only Verso in the UK
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.100]   that published a famous volume called
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.040]   Messages to the World,
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.900]   which was the first compendium of Bin Laden's writings.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.060]   - So he has a Mein Kampf.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.220]   He has a type, does he have a thing where he--
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.300]   - I mean, it's a kind of collected works.
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.060]   It's a collected works of his--
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.940]   - He had like a blog.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.900]   It's a collection of articles versus--
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:47.940]   - Yeah, these are interviews.
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.780]   These are his missives, his declarations,
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.380]   his decrees, right?
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.300]   But I think just in terms of,
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.740]   if we zoom out for a second about
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.620]   American policy choices and so on,
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.720]   the powers that be didn't trust us
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.280]   to know what he was really about.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.120]   I put it that way.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.820]   And I don't say that in a conspiratorial sense.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:11.140]   I just think that it was a taboo.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:15.140]   I think people, there was a kind of consensus that
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:20.220]   trust us, we know how to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.380]   And you don't need to know what they're about
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.500]   because they're crazy.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.540]   They're fanatics, they're fundamentalists.
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.420]   They hate us, remember that language?
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.740]   Us versus them.
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.740]   But if you read Bin Laden, that's when it gets messy.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:34.220]   That's where Bin Laden's argumentation
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:37.140]   is not fundamentally about Islam.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.180]   And if you're sitting here with an Islamic scholar,
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.140]   he would say, depending on which Islamic scholar,
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.540]   they would tend to go through and dissect
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.660]   and negate 99% of the arguments
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:51.100]   that Bin Laden claimed was in Islam, right?
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.580]   But what strikes me as an historian,
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.020]   who's again, looking at this adjacently,
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.420]   if you read Bin Laden, I mean, the arguments that he make
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.420]   are, first of all, they're sophisticated.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:06.420]   They reflect a mind that is about geopolitics.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.940]   He uses terms like imperialism.
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:12.220]   He knows something about world history.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.300]   He knows something about geography.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.100]   - So imperialism is the enemy for him?
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.340]   Or what's the nature of the enemy?
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.180]   - It's an amalgam.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.380]   And like a good politician, which is what I would call him,
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:26.980]   he is adept at speaking in different ways
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.060]   to different audiences.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.580]   So if you look at the context in which he speaks,
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.980]   if you look at messages to the world,
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.700]   if you look at his writings, and you can zoom out now,
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.620]   and we now have compendia of the writings
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.300]   of Al-Qaeda more broadly.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.860]   You can purchase these.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:45.260]   They're basically primary source collections.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.980]   We now have that for the Taliban.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.500]   I mean, what's fascinating about,
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.220]   I think, if you'd like this culture,
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.740]   acknowledging it's very diverse internally,
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.860]   is that these people are representatives
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.140]   of political movements who seek followers.
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.500]   They speak.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:07.500]   They often are very, I'd say, skilled at visual imagery.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.180]   And especially now, I mean, what's fascinating is that,
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.900]   I mean, the Taliban used to shoot televisions.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:17.900]   They used to blow up VCR, videotapes.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:23.660]   They used to string audio and video cassettes from trees
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.860]   and kind of ceremonial hangings, right?
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:30.380]   That were killing this nefarious, infidel technology
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.260]   that is doing the work of Satan.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.740]   And yet today, one of the keys to the Taliban's success
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.860]   is that they got really good at using media.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:42.180]   I mean, brilliant at using the written word,
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.100]   the spoken word, music, actually.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:48.500]   And Hollywood, Hollywood is the gold standard.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:52.300]   And these guys have studied how to create drama,
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.900]   how to speak to modern users.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.020]   I mean, Islamic State did this.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.580]   I mean, the role of media, new media.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.700]   I mean, I follow and I am followed
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:05.700]   by senior Taliban leaders, which is bizarre on Twitter.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.620]   - On Twitter?
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:08.900]   - I don't know why they care about me.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.460]   I'm nothing.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.820]   - They follow you on Twitter.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:13.660]   - I don't know why.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.620]   This is no joke, this is no joke.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:17.260]   They are part of our modern world.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.420]   It's how they talk and it's how they recruit.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.780]   And this is part of the, this is why they are.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.100]   So Bin Laden, if you read Bin Laden,
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.300]   he speaks multiple languages, I would say.
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.500]   It's environmentalism.
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:31.500]   The West is bad because we destroyed the planet.
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.540]   The West is bad because we abuse women.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.820]   So in class, especially female students
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.180]   are very surprised to learn,
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.580]   and actually say, this feminist argument is not,
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.420]   we start with, this is a murderer.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.140]   This is a person who has taken human life,
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.380]   innocent life over and over again.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:56.060]   And he is aspirationally genocidal.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.620]   But let's try to understand what he's about.
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.340]   So we walk through the texts, read them,
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:03.740]   and people are shocked to learn that it's not just about
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.820]   quotations from the Quran
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.300]   strung together in some irrational fashion.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.940]   He knows, I mean, at the core,
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.980]   I'd say is the problem of human suffering.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.420]   And he has a geography of that that is mostly Muslim,
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.700]   but he talked about the suffering of Kashmir.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.580]   All right, so if you have a student in your class
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.260]   who's from South Asia, who knows about Kashmir,
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.980]   he or she will say, that's not entirely inaccurate.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:29.980]   The Indian state commits atrocities in Kashmir.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.340]   Pakistanis have done that too.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:35.100]   Palestine is an issue, right?
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.940]   So you have, in the American university setting,
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.500]   people across the spectrum who get that,
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.460]   Palestinians have had a raw deal.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:46.220]   And so it's a, victimhood is essential
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:50.140]   and it's Muslim victimhood, which is primary,
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.380]   but as a number of scholars have written,
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.420]   and I definitely think this is a framework
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.260]   for what this useful.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.500]   I mean, in this kind of vocabulary,
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.180]   in this framing, this narrative,
[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:03.340]   today, in today's world,
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:06.620]   if we think of today's world being post-Cold War,
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:11.620]   91 to the present, looking at the series of Gulf Wars,
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:12.980]   and seeing the visuals of that,
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.700]   I think that, I think the American public
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:15.540]   has been shielded from some of this,
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:20.100]   but if you look at just the carnage of the Iraqi army
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:24.180]   that George H.W. Bush produced, right?
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.540]   Or you think of the images of the suffering
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:31.220]   of Iraqi children under George H.W. Bush's sanctions,
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.460]   US-British airstrikes,
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.740]   then you have Madeleine Albright
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.460]   answer a question on "60 Minutes" saying,
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.660]   "Do you think the deaths of half a million Iraqi kids
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:41.860]   "is worth it?
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.700]   "Is that justified to contain Saddam Hussein?"
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.900]   And she says on camera, "Yes, it's worth it to me."
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.860]   If you put that all together,
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.340]   I mean, American kids, and of course the American public,
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.940]   they're not always aware of those facts of global history,
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:00.420]   but these guys are, and they very capably
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.060]   use these images, use these tropes,
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.900]   and use facts.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.820]   I mean, some of these things are not deniable.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.020]   I mean, these estimates about the number
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:10.780]   of Iraqi civilian children dead,
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.140]   that came from, I think, the Lancet,
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.020]   and it came from, those are estimates.
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:18.460]   But looking at this from the point of view of Amman,
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:22.580]   of Jaffa, of Nairobi,
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.020]   just think around the planet,
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.540]   if you see yourself as the victim
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.920]   of this great imperial power,
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.700]   you can see why especially young men would be drawn
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:36.700]   to a road of self-sacrifice.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:41.860]   And the idea is that in killing others,
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:46.860]   you are making them feel how you feel.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.200]   Because they won't listen to your arguments reasonably,
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.660]   because they won't recognize Palestinian suffering,
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.900]   Bosnian suffering, Chechen suffering.
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.460]   You go across the planet, right?
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:00.020]   Because they won't recognize our suffering,
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.580]   we're gonna speak to you in the only language
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.220]   you understand, and that's violence.
[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:08.220]   And look at the violence of the post-1991 world,
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.220]   in which American air power really becomes a global
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:15.580]   kind of fact in the lives of so many people.
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.340]   And then the big mistake after 9/11, among many,
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:22.860]   I mean, fundamentally was taking the war on terror
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:25.060]   to some 30 or 40 countries,
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:28.180]   so that you have more and more of the globe
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.980]   feel like they're under attack.
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:32.300]   And the logic is that essentially,
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.540]   it's not, it's free bin Laden,
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.500]   it's not, we're going to convert you
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.820]   and turn you into Muslims, and that's why we're doing this.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.100]   That appears, that claim does appear at times.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.140]   But it's, if you look at any given bin Laden text,
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.500]   I mean, there are 40 claims in each text.
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.900]   I mean, it's kind of, it's dizzying,
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.060]   but he's a modern politician,
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.860]   he knows the language of social equality.
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.820]   You know, that there's a class dimension to it,
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:58.660]   there is an environmental dimension to it,
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.740]   there's a gender dimension to it.
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:04.180]   And yes, there are chronic quotes sprinkled in.
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.500]   And when he wants to speak that language,
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:09.300]   he knew that, you know, he's not a scholar.
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.420]   So he would often get a few recognized scholars to sign on.
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:17.140]   So some of his declarations of jihad had his signature
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:20.500]   kind of sprinkled in with like a dozen other signatures
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.780]   from people who are somewhat known,
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.900]   or at least, you know, with titles, right?
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.220]   So as a kind of intellectual exercise,
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.500]   it's fascinating to see that he is throwing everything
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.100]   at the wall in one level.
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:35.780]   That's one way to see that it's a,
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:39.860]   these are kind of testaments toward recruitment
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:43.860]   of people who, yes, they're angry, yes, they're unhappy.
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:46.540]   And this is what, you know, I think for our broader public,
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:49.980]   it's hard to get, you're like, well, bin Laden didn't suffer.
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.300]   He wasn't poor.
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.780]   Like, yeah, I mean, Lenin, Pol Pot.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:56.380]   - I mean, they're speaking to,
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.580]   they're empathetic to the suffering, the landscape,
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.900]   the full landscape of suffering.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:03.820]   It's interesting to think about suffering, you know,
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:06.940]   America, the American public,
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.940]   American politicians and leaders,
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:13.120]   when they see what is good and evil,
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.580]   they're often not empathetic to the suffering of others.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:21.580]   And what you're saying is bin Laden perhaps accurately
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:24.900]   could speak to the ignorance of America,
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:28.300]   maybe the Soviet Union, to the suffering of their people.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.140]   - That's right.
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:32.740]   - And I mean, if you look at the speeches
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:37.260]   and the ideas that are public of Hitler in the 1930s,
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:42.260]   he spoke quite accurately to the injustice
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:46.500]   and maybe the suffering of the German people.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.100]   It, I mean, charismatic politicians
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:50.860]   are good at telling accurate stories.
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.060]   It's not all fabricated,
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.660]   but they emphasize certain aspects.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.420]   And then the problem part is the actions
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.060]   you should take based on that.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:03.620]   So the narratives and the stories
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:06.700]   may be grounded in historical accuracy.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:11.700]   The actions then cross the line, the ethical line.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.660]   - I thought that too.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:14.780]   I mean, it's a, again, if you pick up just one of these texts,
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:15.980]   I mean, it's a kaleidoscope.
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.460]   So the Hitler analogy is interesting
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:21.220]   because it's, you know, Hitler spoke to,
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.420]   he could speak to things like inflation, right?
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.460]   Which really existed.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:28.740]   But he also appealed to the irrational emotions
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.940]   of Germans, right?
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:34.940]   He sought out scapegoats, you know, Jews, Roma,
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:38.140]   disabled people, homosexuals, and so on, right?
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.140]   That's also there in bin Laden too.
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:44.020]   I mean, the idea of, you know, an anti-Semitism,
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:47.640]   the constant flagging of Zionists and crusaders.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.740]   It's a kind of shotgun approach to a search for followers.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.160]   But I'd also hasten to add that it's,
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.660]   for all of the things that we could tick off saying,
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.380]   well, yes, Kashmiris have suffered,
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.080]   Chechens have suffered, and so on.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:04.300]   Bin Ladenism never became a mass movement.
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.660]   I mean, it never really, I think the,
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.780]   I mean, this is the encouraging thing, right?
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.420]   About ideology.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.860]   I mean, I think the blood on his hands
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:18.080]   always limited his appeal among Muslims and others.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.800]   But bin Laden did have, I mean, he had a,
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:24.700]   there's a great book by a great scholar at UC San Diego,
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:29.120]   Jeremy Prestholt, who wrote a great book about global icons
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:34.120]   in which he has bin Laden, he has Bob Marley,
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:40.440]   he has Tupac, you know, he asked why,
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.360]   you know, when he's doing research in East Africa,
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.260]   why did he see young kids wearing bin Laden shirts?
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.120]   They're also wearing like Tupac shirts.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.000]   They're wearing bin Bob Marley shirts.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.760]   And basically it's a way of looking at
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.940]   a kind of partial embrace of some aspects
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:01.800]   of the rebelliousness of some of these figures,
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:05.280]   some of the time by some people under certain conditions.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.500]   - Well, the terrifying thing to me,
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.760]   so yeah, there is a longing in the human heart
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:13.260]   to belong to a group and a charismatic leader somehow,
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:16.120]   especially when you're young,
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.960]   just a catalyst for all of that.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:22.160]   And I tend to think that perhaps
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.680]   it's actually hard to be Hitler.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:29.560]   So a leader so charismatic that he can rile a nation to war.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:32.600]   And bin Laden, perhaps we're lucky,
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.560]   was not sufficiently charismatic.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.720]   I feel like if his writing was better,
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.560]   if his speeches were better,
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.700]   if his ideas were stronger,
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:46.000]   better, it's like more viral,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.840]   and then there would be more people,
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.560]   kind of young people uniting around him.
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.200]   So in some sense, it's almost like accidents of history
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.260]   of just how much charisma,
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:01.120]   how much charisma a particular evil person has,
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.160]   a person like bin Laden.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.680]   - I think it's fair, evil works, I think.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.400]   - So you think bin Laden is evil?
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.240]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.920]   I mean, he was a mass murderer.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.740]   I'm just saying that his ideas were,
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:17.680]   they're more complex than we've tended to acknowledge.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:22.000]   They have a wider potential resonance
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.360]   than we would acknowledge.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:27.200]   I mean, and also I guess just one fundamental point
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:31.720]   is that thinking about the complexity of bin Laden
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.580]   is also a way of removing him from Islam.
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.800]   He is not an Islamic thinker.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.680]   He is a cosmopolitan thinker
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:43.240]   who plays in all kinds of modern ideologies,
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.720]   which have proven to mobilize people in the past, right?
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:50.720]   So anti-Semitism, populism, environmentalism,
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:56.400]   and the urging to do something about humanity,
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.800]   do something about suffering.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.100]   That's why I think the actual,
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.000]   you ask about what motivates people to do this kind of stuff.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.380]   I think that's why if one goes below the level of leadership
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.720]   and this is being reported,
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:09.240]   if you look at the trial ongoing now in Paris
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.860]   of the Baraklan murders, I think,
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:15.600]   the court allowed some discussion
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.640]   of the backgrounds of the accused.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.340]   And they come from different backgrounds,
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:22.040]   but if there's any common bond,
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.160]   it's kind of that they had some background in petty crime.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.320]   Famously in the 7/7 bombings in London,
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:32.560]   the Metropolitan Police, UK authorities
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.520]   looked at all those guys
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.920]   and what people want is this idea
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.080]   that they must be very pious.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.000]   They must be super Islamic to do this kind of stuff.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.540]   They must be fanatical true believers.
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.340]   But what they found with those guys
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:50.000]   was that some were nominally Muslim,
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.700]   some went to mosques, some didn't.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:57.640]   Some were single, young guys with criminal backgrounds.
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:01.880]   Some were like, sorry, they were kind of misfits
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.400]   who never succeeded in anything.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.920]   But others had, at least one of them had a wife and family
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.480]   who he widowed and orphaned.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.840]   And so there's no, I mean, for policing,
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.160]   I mean, if you're looking at it through that lens,
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.560]   there is no kind of typology
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.120]   that will predict who will become violent.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.140]   And that's why I think we have to move beyond
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.880]   thinking about religious augmentation narrowly or by itself
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.320]   and think about things like geopolitics,
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.220]   think about how people respond to inequality,
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.960]   the existential threat of climate crisis,
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.160]   of a whole host of matters,
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.080]   and think about this is a mode of political contestation.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.560]   I mean, it's a violent one, it's one I condemn.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.200]   It is evil, right?
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.760]   But these are people that are,
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:47.760]   they're trying to be political.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.800]   They're trying to change things in some way.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.480]   It's not narrowly about like,
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:54.220]   I'm gonna impose Sharia law on you.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.960]   You must wear a veil.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.240]   You must eat this kind of food.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.360]   It's not that parochial.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.400]   But another quick thought about your interesting claim
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.360]   about charisma in this,
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.840]   I think that the one self-limiting feature
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:11.000]   of this subculture is that definitely,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.960]   I mentioned the enigma of not wanting to be seen
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.420]   and that the kind of invisibility
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.740]   is a productive force of a power,
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:23.860]   which a colleague of mine who knows ancient history
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.920]   far better than I,
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.440]   this is when she looked at Mullah Omar initially,
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.480]   or we talk about Bin Laden,
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.640]   I mean, this kind of studied posture
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.960]   of staying in the shadows,
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.000]   is also a source of authority potentially,
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.180]   because it invites the idea,
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.820]   and it's partly dictatorships do this well.
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:45.800]   I mean, it invites the idea that someone's working,
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.840]   and maybe it's the basis for a lot of QAnon
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.680]   or other conspiracy today,
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.240]   that someone's working behind the scenes
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.040]   and things are gonna go the right way.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.500]   You can't see it.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.920]   That's almost preferable because you can kind of feel it.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.320]   And so not having someone out front
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.720]   can maybe be more effective
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.880]   than having someone out in front constantly.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.400]   - Maybe, maybe.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.720]   - And then the whole Bin Laden,
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.280]   Mullah Omar thing like you can't see me,
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.360]   or if you look at Bin Laden's photographs
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.000]   and his video stuff,
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.960]   I mean, he's coy.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.840]   Some observers have noted that he's kind of effeminate.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.140]   He doesn't strike this kind of masculine,
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.320]   he's not a Mussolini,
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.260]   he's not a Hitler,
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:25.940]   macho, I'm standing,
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:26.780]   thumping my chest,
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:28.500]   he's not doing the theatrical chin,
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.580]   the theater people tell us is so aggressive.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.620]   - Oh, a chin?
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.500]   Just what, bringing your chin up?
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:38.220]   - I saw a great BBC theater person,
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.420]   it was kind of a,
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:42.300]   it was a makeover show about how to become a better-
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.140]   - A dictator?
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.120]   Oh no, a powerful,
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.740]   yeah, leader, authoritarian figure.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.860]   - No, just how to get ahead in life.
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.060]   And then- - Oh, okay, cool.
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.400]   - And just about acting,
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.720]   how you can act differently, right?
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.360]   So it was a BBC thing.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.520]   And this woman claimed that sticking your chin out,
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.600]   like a wrestler does, right,
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.040]   is the most male-to-male-
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.760]   - I love this kind of- - Most aggressive-
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.400]   - Hilarious analysis that people have about power.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.660]   - But watch the chin, watch the chin.
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:13.120]   - It's the same as analyzing in wrestling,
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.320]   styles that win, or fighting, or so on.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.440]   There's so many ways to do it.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.420]   - Well, the chin, I mean, the chin is a,
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.600]   could be interesting verbal gesture.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.880]   And I've watched enough Mussolini footage from my classes
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.520]   to try to pick the right moment.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.880]   And the chin is, Mussolini's all about the chin, so.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.560]   - And I have watched human beings and human nature enough
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.240]   to know that there's more to a man,
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.080]   a powerful man, than a chin.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.320]   - Yeah, no, no, no, I'm saying it's an act of aggression.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.160]   I'm not saying it's-
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.840]   - It's one of the many tools in the toolkit.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.680]   - Yeah, yeah, sure, yeah.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.680]   - So she definitely-
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.520]   - It's not all about the chin, but it's a-
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.500]   - But that's what I'm trying to tell you about Bin Laden.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.520]   I don't think he was deliberate enough
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.100]   with the way he presents himself.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:55.940]   - What I'm saying about Bin Laden
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.020]   that makes him different from these other characters
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:01.500]   is that because he played it being the scholar,
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.620]   he played it being a figure of modesty and humility.
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:07.980]   And that meant that he was often,
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.520]   again, if you watch his visuals, I mean, yes,
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.800]   there's one video of him firing a gun,
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.260]   but if you watch how he moved,
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.240]   how he wouldn't look at people directly,
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.940]   how his face was almost,
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:20.340]   I mean, he appears to be incredibly shy.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.900]   He's not spoken, his voice was low.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.860]   He attempted to be poetic, right?
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.540]   So it wasn't a warrior kind of image
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.940]   that he tried to project of like a tough guy.
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:34.160]   It was, I'm demure, I'm humble,
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.180]   I'm offering you this message.
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:41.480]   And the appeal that he was going for was to see,
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.640]   to project himself as a scholar,
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.380]   his knowledge and humility, the whole package,
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:52.060]   carried with it an authenticity and a valor
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.400]   that would animate,
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.180]   inspire people to commit acts of violence, right?
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:59.700]   So it's a different kind of logic of like go and kill, right?
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:03.680]   - So he presented himself in contrast
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.920]   to the imperialist kind of macho power.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.800]   - Bombastic, whatever, yeah.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.040]   - So that's just yet another way of,
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.500]   and you have to have facial hair
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.200]   or hair of different kinds that's recognized.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.140]   We had a very recognizable look too,
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:19.980]   or at least later in life.
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:22.860]   - So yeah, no, he tried to look the part.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:23.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.900]   - But I'm saying we're fortunate
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.060]   that whatever calculation that he was making,
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.900]   he was not more effective.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:33.740]   - Yeah.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.820]   - I mean, there's,
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:38.220]   the world is full of terrorist organizations
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:41.460]   and we're fortunate to the degree,
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.680]   any one of them does not have
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.580]   an incredibly charismatic leader
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.760]   that attains the kind of power
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.500]   that's very difficult to manage at the geopolitical level.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:55.060]   - Yeah, and we credit the publics,
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.140]   you know, who don't bind to that, right?
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:57.980]   Who see through this.
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:00.140]   We credit the critics, you know?
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.920]   Fairly on, going back to 9/11 itself,
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:08.880]   one of the problems was that US government officials
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:12.140]   kept kind of leaning on Muslims to condemn this
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:16.280]   as if all Muslims shared some collective responsibility
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.820]   or culpability.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:22.140]   And in fact, dozens of scholars
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.120]   and organizations, hundreds condemned this,
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.180]   but their condemnations never quite made it out.
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.940]   But it created a tension where, you know,
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.460]   if you wore a veil, you must've been one of them
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:34.020]   and you must be on team Bin Laden.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.660]   And so a lot of the, you know,
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.440]   I think a lot of the popular violence and discrimination
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:43.440]   and profiling came out of that urge to see a oneness,
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.400]   which, you know, Bin Laden projected, right?
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.060]   He wanted to say, we are one community, you know,
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.620]   if you are a Muslim, you must be with me, right?
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:53.940]   But I think that's where the diversity
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.580]   of Muslim communities became important
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.400]   because outside of small pockets,
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.060]   I mean, they didn't accept his leadership, right?
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.460]   People wore t-shirts in some countries.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.420]   I mean, non-Muslims wore t-shirts
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.980]   'cause he was like, he stuck it to the Americans.
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:07.180]   So in Latin America, people were like,
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.620]   yeah, that was sad, but you know, finally,
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:10.960]   I mean, there was a kind of schadenfreude
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.800]   in that moment internationally.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.820]   - Yeah, it's like Che Guevara or somebody like that.
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.460]   - Yeah, Che's the other character in Pesel's book, yeah.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.720]   Yeah, that's right, that's right, yeah.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.960]   - It's just as simple, it's not exactly what he believed
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.240]   or the cruelty of actions he took.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.960]   It's more like he stood for an idea
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.100]   of revolution versus authority.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.020]   - That's right.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.780]   And that's a great way to understand Bin Ladenism
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:33.620]   and the whole phenomenon,
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.400]   but I think looking at the big picture,
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:40.200]   it's also, you wonder, will that ever end, right?
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.180]   I mean, is that, I mean, that's the risk
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:45.160]   of being a kind of hyperpower like the US
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.960]   where you, in insisting on a kind of unipolar world
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:53.620]   in 2001, 2002, 2003, I think that created
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:58.600]   an almost irresistible target wherever the US
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.700]   wanted to exert itself militarily.
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.000]   - Before I go to the history of Afghanistan,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.960]   the people, and I just wanna talk to you
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:10.600]   about just some fascinating aspect of the culture.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   Let's go to the end, withdrawal of US troops
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.100]   from Afghanistan.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:20.720]   What are your thoughts on how that was executed?
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.480]   How could it have been done better?
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.040]   - Yeah, an important question.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.240]   I mean, I would preface all this by saying,
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.840]   as I noted, I think the war was a mistake.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.560]   I had hoped the war would end sooner.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.920]   I think there were different exit routes all along the way.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.480]   Again, I think there were lots of policy choices
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.960]   in September, in October when the war began.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:50.560]   There were choices in December, 2001.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.080]   So we could look at almost every six-month stopping point
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.600]   and say we could have done differently.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.760]   As it turns out, though, I mean, the way it played out,
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.440]   you know, it's been catastrophic.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.600]   And I think the Biden administration
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.240]   has remained unaccountable for the scale
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.360]   of the strategic and humanitarian and ethical failure
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.000]   that they're responsible for.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.360]   - Well, okay, let's lay out the full.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.560]   There's George W. Bush.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.080]   There's Barack Obama.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.360]   There's Donald Trump.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.860]   - That's right. - There's Biden.
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:31.240]   So they're all driving this van
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.520]   and there's these exits and they keep not taking the exits
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.520]   and they're running out of gas.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.960]   I do this all the time thinking,
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:38.960]   where am I gonna pull off?
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.240]   I'll go to the vertilis empty.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.880]   How could have it been done better?
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.760]   And what exactly, how much suffering
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.400]   have all the decisions along the way caused?
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.240]   What are the long-term consequences?
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.360]   What are the biggest things that concern you
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.360]   about the decisions we've made
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.600]   in both invading Afghanistan
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.400]   and staying in Afghanistan as long as we have?
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.960]   - I mean, if we start at the end, as you proposed,
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.600]   you know, the horrific scenes of the airport,
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.680]   you know, that was just one dimension.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.440]   I think in the weeks to come,
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.040]   I mean, we're gonna see Afghanistan implode.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:22.120]   There are lots of signs that malnutrition,
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.120]   hunger, starvation are going to claim
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.760]   tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.560]   of lives this winter.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:33.120]   And I think there is really nothing,
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:38.120]   there's no framework in place to foresaw that.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.520]   - What is the government,
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.920]   what is currently the system there?
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.760]   What's the role of the Taliban?
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.640]   So there could be tens of thousands,
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.440]   hundreds of thousands that starve,
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:54.400]   either just almost a famine or starve to death.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.120]   So this is economic implosion, this is political implosion.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.560]   What's the system there like
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.040]   and what could be the one, you know, some inkling of hope?
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:05.880]   - Right, right.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.640]   The Taliban sit in control.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.480]   That's unique.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.400]   When they were in power in the 1990s,
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:16.400]   from 1996, 2001, they controlled some 85 to 90%
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.880]   of the country.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.420]   Now they own it all, but they have no budget.
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:27.420]   The Afghan banking system is frozen.
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.980]   - So the financial system's a mess.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:32.380]   - And it's frozen by the US
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.540]   because the US is trying to use that lever
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.980]   to exert pressure on the Taliban.
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:39.260]   And so the ethical quandaries are, of course,
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:40.580]   legion, right?
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.060]   Do you release that money to allow the Taliban
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:46.780]   to shore up their rule, right?
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.940]   The Biden administration has said no,
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.400]   but the banks aren't working.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.260]   If you're in California,
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.700]   you wanna send $100 to your cousin,
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.900]   so she can buy bread.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.020]   You can't do that now.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.400]   It's almost impossible.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.620]   There are some informal networks.
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:06.180]   They're moving some stuff, but there are bread lines.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:09.340]   The Taliban government is incapable,
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:10.740]   fundamentally, just of ruling.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.640]   I mean, they can discipline people on the street.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.700]   They can force people into the mosque.
[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:16.780]   They can shoot people.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.820]   They can beat protesters.
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.780]   They can put out a newspaper.
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.900]   They can have, they're great at diplomacy, it turns out.
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:24.900]   They can't rule this country.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.820]   So essentially, the hospitals
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:31.680]   and the kind of healthcare infrastructure
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.680]   is being managed by NGOs that are international.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.220]   But most people had to leave,
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.760]   and the Taliban have impeded some of that work.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.020]   They've told adult women, essentially, to stay home, right?
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:51.760]   So a big part of the workforce isn't there.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.760]   So I mean, the supply chain is kind of crawling to a halt.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.240]   Trade with Pakistan and its neighbors,
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.600]   I mean, it's kind of a transit trade economy.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.520]   It exports fruits.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.480]   Pakistan has been closing the border
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.040]   because they're anxious about refugees.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.040]   They wanna exert pressure on the international community
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.640]   to recognize the Taliban,
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.480]   because the Pakistan want the Taliban to succeed in power,
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.440]   because they see that in Pakistan's national interest,
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.000]   especially through the lens of its rivalry with India.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.400]   So the Pakistani security institutions
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.240]   are playing a double game.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.440]   Essentially, the Afghan people are being held hostage.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.280]   And so the Taliban are also saying,
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.280]   if you don't recognize us,
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.120]   you're gonna let tens of millions of Afghans starve.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.120]   - So to which degree is Taliban, like, who are the Taliban?
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.720]   What do they stand for?
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.360]   What do they want?
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.880]   Obviously, year by year, this changes.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.600]   So what is the nature of this organization?
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.800]   Can they be a legitimate, peaceful, kind, respectful
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:02.440]   government sort of holder of power,
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.960]   or are they fundamentally not capable of doing so?
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.120]   - Yeah.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.960]   I mean, the briefest answer would be that they are a
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.320]   clerical/military organization.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   They have, this is kind of a imperfect metaphor,
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:28.200]   but years ago, a German scholar used the term caravan
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.280]   to describe them.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.120]   And that has some attractive elements,
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.080]   because different people who joined the Taliban
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.480]   for different purposes at different times.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.120]   But today, and people tell us,
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.920]   scholars who know more about the movement than I,
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.200]   have said, "Listen, the Taliban is this kind of hodgepodge
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:48.280]   of different actors and people and competing interests."
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.000]   And I think, so we have a lot of scholars who say,
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.040]   "Listen, it's polycentric.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:57.280]   It's got people in this city and that city and so on."
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.000]   I think actually, I was always very skeptical.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:00.880]   How do they know this?
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.720]   I mean, this is an organization that doesn't want you to know
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.760]   where their money comes from and so on.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.640]   But I would say, now that we have a clearer picture
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.280]   of what has happened, I'd say they are a astoundingly
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:17.720]   well-organized clerical military organization
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.720]   that has a very cohesive and enduring ideology,
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.040]   which is quite idiosyncratic if we zoom out
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.120]   and continue the conversation we're having about Islam
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.760]   and how we think about radicalism and who's drawn to what.
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:38.520]   People throw different terms around to describe the Taliban.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:43.040]   Some use a term that links it to a kind of school of thought
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.900]   born in the 19th century in India, the Doobandi school.
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:49.960]   But if you look at their teachings, it's very clear now,
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:53.000]   I think that these labels, it's like saying,
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.120]   "You're an MIT guy."
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:54.960]   Well, what does that mean?
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.400]   I mean, MIT is home to dozens of different,
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.360]   potentially, kinds of intellectual orientations, right?
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.900]   I mean, attaching the name of a school
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:07.440]   doesn't quite capture, I mean, university.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.280]   - It's complicated.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.520]   I mean, actually, MIT is interesting
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.360]   'cause I would say MIT is different
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.020]   than Stanford, for example.
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:16.520]   I think MIT has a more kind of narrow-
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.040]   - Yeah, I hear you.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.760]   Bad analogy on my part, maybe.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.760]   - Well, no, it's interesting because I would argue
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.760]   that there's some aspect of a brand, like Taliban or MIT,
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:32.040]   no relation, that has a kind of interact,
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:37.160]   like the brand results in the behavior of the,
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.280]   like enforces a kind of behavior on the people
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.960]   and the people feed the brand.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:41.880]   And like, there's a loop.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.820]   I think Stanford is a good example
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.180]   of something that's more distributed.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.260]   There's sufficient amount of diversity
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:50.040]   in like all kinds of like centers
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.020]   and all that kind of stuff
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:54.700]   that the brand doesn't become one thing.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.220]   And MIT is so engineering.
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.100]   It's so good at that.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.620]   - Okay, scratch MIT, scratch Stanford too,
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:03.580]   'cause I think Stanford's more like MIT
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.980]   than you might imagine.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:08.820]   - But isn't Taliban, isn't it pretty,
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:10.700]   I don't think there's a diversity.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.240]   So yeah, sorry, so just to rephrase.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.120]   So people say, oh, the Deobandi school.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.360]   I'm like, what is that?
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:20.500]   I mean, the Taliban are, they're an ethnic movement.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:25.500]   They represent a vision of Pashtun power, right?
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:30.000]   Pashtuns are people who are quite internally diverse,
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.960]   who actually speak multiple dialects of Pashto,
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:39.960]   who reside across the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.840]   There are Pashtuns who live all over the planet, right?
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.360]   There's a community in Moscow, California, everywhere, right?
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.680]   So it's a global diaspora of sorts.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.160]   Pashtuns have a kind of genealogical imagination
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.640]   so that lots of Pashtuns can tell you
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.680]   the names of their grandparents,
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.600]   great-grandparents and so on.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.880]   And that's kind of a, there's a sense of pride in that.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:03.600]   Pashto language is a kind of core element of that identity,
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.320]   but it's not universal.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.760]   So for example, you can meet people who say,
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.680]   I am Pashtun, but I don't know Pashto.
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:14.840]   So as you claw away at this idea, it's amorphous.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.400]   It also means different things to different people
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.240]   at different times.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.680]   So saying the Taliban are Pashtun
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.720]   requires lots of qualifiers
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.040]   because lots of Pashtuns will say,
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.480]   no, no, I have nothing to do with the Taliban.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.480]   I hate those people.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:32.680]   So the Taliban tried to mobilize other Pashtuns
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.120]   with limited success,
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.040]   but their core membership is almost exclusively Pashtun.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.200]   And they say, no, no, we represent Afghans.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.480]   We represent pious Muslims.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.040]   And so in recent two, three years,
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.920]   they've gone further to say, no, we have other ethnic groups.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.680]   We have Uzbeks, we have Tajiks, we have Hazaras.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.640]   And in the north of Afghanistan, in recent years,
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.280]   they did do a bit better at drawing in people
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.800]   who were very disaffected because of the government
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.600]   and they were able to diversify their ranks somewhat.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.060]   But if you watch, say, August 15 and who they've appointed,
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:09.960]   what language they've used, how they've presented themselves,
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:14.520]   it's clear that they are Pashtun, they are male,
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.520]   and they are extremely ideologically cohesive
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.840]   and disciplined, I'd say.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.880]   So I think that a lot of the polycentrism, blah, blah,
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.080]   some of that stuff was a way to fight a war.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.000]   They are fundamentally a guerrilla movement.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.620]   They see themselves as kind of pious Robin Hoods.
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:40.340]   Their rhetoric is very much about taking from the rich,
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:43.100]   taking from the privileged, giving to the poor,
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:47.020]   being on the side of the underdog, fighting against evil.
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:50.220]   And so, I mean, their bag, if you like, their thing,
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:53.780]   their central theme, their brand is about public morality.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.940]   And so their origin story, going back to 1994,
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:20:00.940]   is that they interceded, they broke up a gang of criminals
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.300]   who were trying to rape people.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.460]   And so there's a very interesting kind of like,
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:10.780]   if it's not like sexuality and on public morality,
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:12.820]   and really being the core of like,
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:16.100]   we're gonna restore order and public morality,
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.020]   and how that translates into governance
[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.300]   is something they've never sorted out.
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.860]   I mean, how do you run a banking system
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.700]   if your intellectual priorities are really about
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:25.380]   the length of a beard?
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:29.260]   And then their path to power, in a kind of abstract sense,
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:32.100]   I mean, a lot of that was very much driven by,
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:37.300]   if you like, propagating the promise of martyrdom.
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.780]   And that sounds, I don't mean to say that in a way that,
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:40.740]   to make it sound ridiculous,
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.380]   make it sound like it's a moral judgment.
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:45.800]   It's simply, I think, a fact.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.420]   It's a fact of their appeal that they promised young men
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:54.420]   who have known nothing else but studying in certain schools,
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:57.220]   if at all, but they've known fighting,
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.940]   and they've known victimization.
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:03.180]   And this isn't, I'm not asking for like sympathy for them,
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:05.380]   but I think the reality is that a lot of the,
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:08.820]   we know about the kind of foot soldiers is that they,
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:12.620]   they lost families in bombings, in airstrikes,
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:15.300]   in night raids, you know,
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.360]   I mean, orphans have always been a stream,
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:21.000]   living in all-male society,
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.260]   not knowing girls, not knowing women,
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:27.420]   hearing things from outside about places like Kabul.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.180]   And so there's always been this kind of urban,
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:30.540]   rural dimension.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:35.540]   It's not just that, but I think there's a whole imagination
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:39.740]   that being Taliban captures.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.980]   And the whole martyrdom thing is really, it's,
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.060]   you know, I think to any religious person,
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.860]   I mean, it's not a bizarre idea.
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.780]   I mean, it animates, I mean, so many global traditions,
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.680]   you know, but I think the,
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.780]   but you try to tell like an army colonel, right?
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.820]   If you were to have a conversation with, you know,
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:59.140]   US Marine about this, I mean,
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:01.320]   someone get it from their own religious backgrounds,
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.260]   but I think the, it's an alien idea,
[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:06.300]   but I think it is essential to kind of stretch out
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.580]   my notions of saying that's, that's attractive.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:11.360]   And now one of the dilemmas going forward is that
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.180]   they've got to pivot from martyrdom.
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.700]   And some have been, some have told foreign journalists,
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:19.140]   I mean, it's good that we're in charge now,
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:21.740]   we're going to build a proper state,
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:23.680]   but I, it's kind of boring.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.580]   I want to keep fighting, I want to,
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:26.800]   maybe I'll do it in Pakistan.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.980]   - Yeah, I mean, it's nice that they are expressing
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:32.040]   that thought, some are not even honest sufficiently
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.240]   with themselves to express that kind of thought.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.760]   If you're a fighter,
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:40.920]   you see that with a bunch of fighters
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.920]   or professional athletes, once they retire,
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.160]   they don't know, it's very, it's boring.
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.960]   - And so like, if the spirit of the Taliban,
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:55.060]   even the best version of the Taliban is to fight,
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:56.860]   is to be martyrs, is to,
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:23:00.340]   and paint the world as good and evil
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.940]   and you're fighting evil and all that kind of stuff
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.660]   that's difficult to imagine how they can run
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:07.620]   an education system, a banking system,
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:12.060]   respect all kinds of citizens with different backgrounds
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.220]   and religious beliefs and women
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.660]   and all that kind of stuff, so.
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:18.500]   - Yeah, and they've walked into Kabul
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.720]   and other major cities, some are young,
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.780]   they didn't know those places,
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:27.000]   but also the very important obstacle for them
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.980]   is that Afghan society has changed.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:31.540]   I mean, it's not what, even for the older guys,
[01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.400]   it's not what they knew in the 1990s.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.540]   Some always had some ambivalence about the capital,
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:38.540]   but now it's totally different.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:39.420]   I mean, they've been shocked to see,
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:42.660]   I think to me, one of the most striking features
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:44.460]   of the last few weeks has been that,
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.140]   women have come out on the streets
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:50.340]   and have stood in their faces and said,
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:52.220]   we demand rights, we demand education,
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:57.020]   we demand employment, and these foot soldiers are paralyzed.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:57.940]   They're not sure.
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.820]   - They don't know what to do with women, period.
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.300]   - Yeah, yeah, and they don't know what to do
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.300]   with being yelled at and having someone
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.300]   stick their fingers in their faces.
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.740]   I mean, this is not what they've imagined.
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:10.380]   And so I think, and at this juncture,
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.500]   there are still foreign cameras around.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:16.320]   So they have committed acts of violence against women,
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.580]   against journalists, they've beaten people,
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.580]   they've disappeared people.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:22.140]   - Even with cameras around, even in this tense period.
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.860]   - Yeah, but I think that when the cameras retreat
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:26.340]   and that's like it happened,
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:28.540]   it's gonna get much worse, I think.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:31.380]   So the challenge now is, can the Taliban rule?
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:35.100]   And then this is where the diplomacy is so important
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:38.620]   because the Taliban can't rule in isolation.
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.540]   And they know that.
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.780]   And part of the success is due to the fact
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:45.500]   that they became very good at talking to other people
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.260]   in the last, I mean, it's been building for the last decade,
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.660]   but that's the last five years.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:52.300]   And they always have Pakistan's backing.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:55.860]   And so the Taliban are, we noted their military force,
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:57.300]   very effective guerrilla force.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:58.460]   They beat NATO.
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.940]   I mean, this is, still hasn't sunk in.
[01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:04.340]   I mean, the fact that they, with light arms,
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:08.660]   using suicide attacks, using mines,
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:13.380]   improvised explosive devices, machine guns.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:17.140]   In some, in recent years, they got sniper rifles.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.060]   And from the summer,
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:22.380]   they got American equipment on a broad scale.
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:23.220]   They have airplanes.
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:25.820]   They have a lot that they will be able to use eventually.
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:30.740]   But still, basically it's a story of AK-47s,
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:33.780]   some American small arms and mines.
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.140]   So it's very Ho Chi Minh,
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.220]   very old school guerrilla fighting.
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.380]   And they defeated the most powerful military alliance
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:41.460]   in world history, probably.
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.260]   So that has not yet sunk in.
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.980]   What that means for American and global politics.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:49.420]   And now they're trying to rule, right?
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:52.500]   They know they need international support.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.140]   And their most consistent backer has been Pakistan,
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.980]   who sees them as an extension of Pakistani power.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.700]   Yeah, and this is very important for a Pakistani elite
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:05.340]   that of course is looking toward India.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:08.580]   They wanna have their rear covered, right?
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.740]   They wanna make sure that these postures
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:13.100]   don't cause trouble for Pakistan.
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:15.420]   And they like, I mean, for some of the security forces,
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:17.940]   they like this vision of the Islamic State
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:19.580]   that the Taliban are building there
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:22.100]   because those are not citizen from their views
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:24.340]   of what Pakistan should be.
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:27.220]   But the Taliban have been smart enough
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:30.420]   to kind of diversify their potential international allies.
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.580]   So everyone in the neighborhood
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:34.860]   has wanted the US to leave, right?
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.580]   If we go back to 2001,
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:39.180]   there were Iranian and American special forces in the North
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.700]   working together against the Taliban to displace them
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:45.340]   using Iranian, American,
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:48.860]   and then Afghan resistance forces against the Taliban.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:50.220]   And that was a real moment of Rav Pashmallah,
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.940]   if we go back to the missed exits.
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:55.980]   The relation with Iran could have been different
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:27:00.340]   at that moment, but the US under George W. Bush,
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:03.580]   devised this axis of evil language,
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:08.660]   put them together with their enemy Iraq and the North Korea,
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:10.180]   all that went South.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.460]   That was the most opportunity.
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:14.700]   But in recent years, the Taliban in Iran
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:19.140]   have kind of papered over the differences.
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:22.580]   They allowed the Taliban to open some offices
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.460]   on Iranian territory,
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:26.540]   likely shared some resources, some intelligence,
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.500]   some sophisticated weaponry.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.660]   And then the Taliban went to Moscow.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:32.900]   And for the Putin administration,
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:34.460]   they've long been worried that,
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:38.620]   they see the Taliban as a kind of disease
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:40.620]   that will potentially move North,
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:43.180]   in fact Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan,
[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:44.660]   Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.980]   and maybe creep into Russia's sphere of influence.
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:49.380]   Maybe that's why they have
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:52.540]   a bunch of troops sitting in Tajikistan.
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:56.300]   I mean, the one forward base that Russia still has
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.780]   in Central Asia is in Tajikistan.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:01.820]   And so the Taliban were always a worrying point,
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.540]   but also useful because they could say,
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:08.380]   well, in case the Taliban get out of control,
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.900]   we need to be here.
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:12.220]   And so Tajikistan said, okay,
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.100]   you're helping secure us.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:17.020]   And yes, it impinges upon our sovereignty, but it's okay.
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:22.220]   So Putin said, let's give another black eye
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:25.420]   to the Americans and let's treat the Taliban
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:27.500]   as if they're the kind of government in waiting.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:30.220]   Let's have them come to Moscow multiple times.
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:32.620]   This summer, for the last year or two,
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:34.340]   they've been talking to China.
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:39.340]   So the photographs of senior Taliban figures
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:40.820]   going from their office in Qatar,
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:43.500]   which was a major blow to the US-backed government,
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:46.380]   the fact that they were able to open up an office in Qatar,
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.940]   that at one point began to fly a flag
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:51.380]   of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:54.300]   that basically said we're a state in the waiting.
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.980]   And as the US-backed Afghan government
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:00.540]   failed and failed and failed at ruling too,
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:02.580]   as they showed how corrupt they were,
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:04.700]   and as they really alienated more and more Afghans
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:07.420]   by committing acts of violence against them,
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.260]   by stealing from them,
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:14.260]   by basically creating a kind of kleptocracy,
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:20.720]   the Taliban said, we are pure, we are not corrupt.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.700]   And look at us, we're winning on the battlefield.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:25.300]   And internationally, look, we're talking to China.
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:27.980]   - We're talking to Putin, we're talking to China.
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:31.260]   We're a legitimate, powerful center of Central Asia.
[01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:34.540]   And also kind of hinting that we have a website.
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:36.220]   I mean, the whole digital angle is amazing
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:39.420]   because they began to, and this is important actually,
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:43.420]   they had a website which grew more and more sophisticated.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:45.660]   Again, after having shot televisions
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:47.620]   and these kind of ceremonial killings
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:49.940]   of these infidel devices, right?
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:53.580]   They said, we have a government, we have commissions,
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.460]   we have a complaint line.
[01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:58.020]   They lifted all this technocratic language
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:00.420]   that you get from any UN document
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:02.740]   about good governance and all that kind of,
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.540]   generic language that the NGO world has produced for us,
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:06.820]   right, in English.
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.700]   They reproduced that in five languages
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.500]   on their Taliban website.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.380]   And of course, I'm not saying anyone believed this,
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:16.260]   but it was like, just put me in coach.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:18.140]   I know the playbook, I know how to run a government.
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:20.760]   And look, we have an agricultural commission.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:24.300]   We have a taxation system.
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.260]   And again, this idea, and then on the ground,
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:28.420]   they had their own law courts
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:30.460]   and they would creep into a district,
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:32.940]   assassinate some people, the local authority figures,
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:36.460]   men of influence, talk to local clerics,
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.700]   either get them on board or kill them,
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:41.320]   and say, this state is corrupt,
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.300]   but we're bringing you justice.
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:43.380]   This is our calling card.
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:45.780]   We're bringing public morality and justice.
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:49.060]   And then to a broader world, they said,
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:50.500]   yeah, things didn't go perfectly,
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.820]   a whole Al Qaeda thing,
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:54.820]   we should be kind of do over on that.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:58.840]   We're not gonna let anyone hurt you from our territory.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:03.280]   We just wanna rule and people like us and look.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.960]   And so if we look at the neighborhood, Iran,
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.440]   even Central Asian states after a while,
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.560]   recognizing they could make some money.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.500]   I mean, one thing that Uzbekistan likes
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.080]   about the current arrangement,
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:16.000]   or they're not hostile to is that
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.520]   they have all these contracts.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.820]   They can potentially make some money from,
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:23.400]   the pipeline dream remains alive,
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.400]   running natural gas, oil, to,
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.100]   it was to the Indian Ocean,
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:31.440]   to markets beyond Central Asia.
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:32.800]   It's sitting on a couple trillion dollars
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.160]   probably in mineral resources
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:36.560]   that China would love to have, of course.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.520]   And so people are looking at Afghanistan now,
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.340]   after 20 years saying,
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:42.760]   under American rule, it was a basket case, right?
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:46.680]   There was immense human suffering, incredibly violent.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.160]   The world did not start counting civilian casualties
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.120]   in Afghanistan until 2009.
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:51.960]   I mean, think about that.
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.520]   It went on for eight years.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.840]   The Taliban were never really defeated.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.160]   They just went to Pakistan.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:59.260]   They went to the mountains, they went to the woods.
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:01.640]   And so all these different American operations,
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:05.460]   as you noted, under Bush, Obama, Trump, and so on,
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:09.480]   killed countless civilians.
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:10.640]   The US never accounted for that.
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.260]   We never even counted.
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:15.560]   Trump escalated the civilian casualties
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.320]   by escalating the air war.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:20.280]   But a lot of this was like very ugly, on the ground,
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:22.800]   night raid stuff, where you drop into a Hamlet
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:25.900]   and massacre people.
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:27.960]   And then you're not honest about what happened, right?
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:31.200]   So that dynamic continued to fuel the growth
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.760]   of the Taliban from below.
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:35.160]   So the foot soldiers, they never ran out of foot soldiers.
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:39.360]   I mean, the US and its allies killed tens of thousands,
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.200]   maybe hundreds of thousands of Taliban fighters
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.820]   over the last 20 years.
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:44.960]   But they just sprouted up again.
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.500]   And part of that was the kind of solidarity culture,
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:51.100]   the male bonding of martyrology, of martyrdom,
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:56.100]   and of revenge, and a sense of the foreign invader.
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:33:01.540]   And I haven't taught a ton of US military people,
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:04.420]   but through the Hoover, they put officers
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:07.460]   in our classes sometimes, and met a few wonderful
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:10.780]   Army and Marine officers who I really enjoyed.
[01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:13.060]   We came from the South like me,
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:15.340]   always had great rapport with them.
[01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:16.980]   And they expressed a range of opinions about this.
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:19.180]   I think that I learned a lot from someone who said,
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:21.780]   yeah, I mean, I get why they hate us.
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:25.940]   I get why they're still fighting because last week,
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:30.940]   we just killed 14 of their fellow villagers.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:36.300]   So the officers, the guys on the ground fighting this war,
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:37.420]   we're not stupid about that.
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:39.580]   I mean, they got the human dimension of that,
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.780]   and yet no one got off the exit, as you said.
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:42.780]   People kept driving.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.460]   But going forward now, internationally,
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:49.020]   it's critical that they have,
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.540]   and they've had meetings.
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.740]   I mean, what the Taliban have done since August 15th
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.240]   is a lot of diplomacy.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.980]   They've had meetings, they've had people,
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:58.620]   they've had Tashkent come, they've had Beijing come,
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:00.400]   they've had Moscow come.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.880]   I mean, they've had major visits from Islamabad,
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:09.340]   from security people, from diplomatic circles.
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:12.020]   And they're counting on things being different this time.
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:13.180]   I mean, the first time around,
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:15.980]   the only people who backed the Taliban by recognition,
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:17.700]   giving them diplomatic recognition
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:20.340]   were the Saudis, Pakistanis, and the UAE.
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:23.980]   And because of Al-Qaeda, because of opium,
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:27.100]   because of some of the human rights stuff,
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:28.500]   the US pushed everyone to like,
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.340]   let's not recognize this state, even though the US did.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:35.580]   I mean, Colin Powell famously, in the summer of 2001,
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:39.980]   we did give a few grants and aid to the Taliban
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:44.540]   as kind of like massaging negotiations.
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:46.300]   They kept talking about Bin Laden,
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.540]   but they also wanted them to stop opium production.
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:50.860]   I mean, Afghanistan throughout all this period
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:52.420]   we've talked about is the global center
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:54.340]   of opium production.
[01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:57.580]   I mean, over the years, more and more of the Afghan economy
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:00.580]   continued to today is devoted to the opium trade.
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:05.380]   - Opium, which is the thing that leads to heroin,
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:08.020]   some of the painkillers.
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:12.820]   - And even if Afghan poppies don't make it to Hoboken,
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:17.700]   they are not the source of American deaths.
[01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:22.900]   They are part of a universal market, a global market,
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:25.980]   which I think any economist would tell you
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.700]   is part of the story of our opium problem.
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:34.700]   - Something I read maybe a decade ago now,
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:36.540]   and I just kind of looked it up again
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.460]   to bring it up to see your opinion on this,
[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:43.100]   is a 2010 report by the International Council
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.420]   on Security and Development that showed
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:50.420]   that 92% of Afghans in Helmand and Kandahar province
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:56.940]   know nothing of the 9/11 attacks on US in 2001.
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:00.540]   Is this at all representative of what you know?
[01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:01.740]   Is this possible?
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:03.940]   So basically, put another way,
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:10.100]   is it possible that a lot of Afghans don't even know
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:13.140]   the reason why there may be troops
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:17.500]   or the sort of American provided narrative
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:21.380]   for why there's troops, American soldiers
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:25.540]   and American drones overhead in Afghanistan?
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:26.620]   - Right.
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.740]   I mean, my gut response,
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:30.900]   not knowing the details of this actual poll,
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:35.900]   is that that's a very unhelpful way to think
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.980]   about how Afghans relate to the world.
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:42.420]   And I think it could be,
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:46.300]   if you go to my hometown in North Carolina,
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.220]   if you knock on some doors,
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:50.780]   you may meet people who don't know all kinds of things.
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.140]   I could probably walk around this neighborhood
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.260]   here in California and there'd be all kinds of people
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:56.780]   who don't know all kinds of things.
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:01.540]   Kyrie Irving apparently thinks the earth is flat.
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:06.540]   I mean, so we could make a lot of certain kinds
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:08.180]   of ignorance, I think.
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:09.980]   But I think what I would say,
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:12.140]   and then there's also a companion point maybe
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:15.140]   that in thinking about the withdrawal, the collapse,
[01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:17.020]   the return of the Taliban,
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:19.220]   there's been a big conversation about
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:21.780]   what Afghans think of us really.
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:24.260]   And this famous piece in "The New Yorker"
[01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:28.740]   was about how many people liked the Taliban,
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:33.740]   that many women interviewed supposedly in this piece,
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:37.340]   were sympathetic 'cause they'd lost family members
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:38.260]   and all the violence.
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:40.340]   And the idea kind of was that,
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:42.500]   we haven't thought about that at all.
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:45.340]   When in fact, of course we have and lots of people have,
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:48.300]   but I think if you're just dropping into the conversation,
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:49.780]   if you look at like an immediate arc of coverage
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:50.940]   of Afghanistan and the United States,
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:55.500]   I mean, the arc went from lots of coverage during,
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.780]   of course, 9/11 and its aftermath,
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:00.860]   lots of coverage during Obama's surge,
[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:03.700]   and then quickly dropped down the last decade
[01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:05.260]   has been almost nothing.
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.380]   So if you ask the same question about Americans
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:09.500]   or other Americans, I'm not sure what they would say to you,
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.380]   what percentage would actually know
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:14.340]   why the US is in X, Y, or Z either, right?
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:15.300]   But again, the Afghan side,
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.220]   just to return to that for a moment,
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:19.540]   I think that we can fetishize these provinces.
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:22.940]   They are a kind of a place where Taliban support
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.140]   has been greatest.
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.620]   Also where there's been the most violence,
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.300]   where the Americans have been most committed
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:30.420]   to trying to root out the Taliban movement.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:31.660]   - This is Helmand and Kana.
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:32.500]   - Exactly, in the South.
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:33.340]   - What are the other parts?
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.500]   It's in the South of Afghanistan.
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.900]   - Yeah, and it's mostly Pashtun, not exclusively,
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.500]   but mostly Pashtun, mostly rural.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:40.380]   - What is Pashtun?
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:41.220]   - That's the ethnic group
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:44.700]   that the Taliban claim to represent, right?
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:45.540]   So they are this group.
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.620]   - What other groups are there?
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.020]   - Okay, sorry, yeah, sorry.
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:50.980]   So in cities, you'll find everything, right?
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:51.900]   That is in Afghanistan.
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.740]   You'll find Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:39:00.740]   These are people who, Uzbek is a Turkic language, right?
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:03.300]   Most Uzbeks live in what is now Uzbekistan,
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:06.700]   but they form majorities in some northern parts of the city.
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:08.700]   I'm sorry, of the country of Afghanistan.
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:10.300]   But what I emphasize is that,
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:14.020]   and you can find online an ethnographic map of Afghanistan,
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:16.860]   and you'll see green where Pashtuns live,
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:20.460]   red where Hazaras live, orange where Uzbeks live,
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:22.500]   purple where Tajiks live.
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:23.940]   Then there are a bunch of other smaller groups
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:25.500]   of different kinds.
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:30.500]   There are Noristani, there are Baluch,
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.640]   there are different religious communities.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.980]   There are Sunni, Shia, different kinds of Shia.
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:36.700]   - What are the key differences between them?
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:39.980]   Is it religious basis from the origins
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:43.420]   of where they immigrated from, and how different are they?
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:46.220]   - So they're all, I mean, they're all indigenous, I think.
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:47.300]   I mean, there's a kind of mythology
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.580]   that some groups have been there longer, right?
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:52.940]   So they have a greater claim to power, but historically,
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:55.900]   I mean, it's like, you know, ethnic groups anywhere,
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:58.500]   people have different narratives about themselves.
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:01.900]   But many Pashtuns would tell you, not all,
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:04.780]   but many would say, we are the kind of state builders
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:09.660]   of Afghanistan, the dynasty that ruled much of the space,
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:12.140]   that was born in the mid 18th century,
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:15.420]   that ruled until 1973, more or less,
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:18.500]   generalizing, you know, it was a Pashtun dynasty.
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:21.900]   The Taliban have definitely said, to some audiences,
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:24.940]   we are the rightful rulers because we are Pashtun.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:28.620]   The trick though is, I don't mean to be evasive,
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:30.700]   but just to convey some of the complexity,
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:34.460]   one quick answer as well, they're majorities and minorities.
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:37.440]   I mean, one finds that a lot along with those maps.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.980]   But I would say, suspend any firm belief in that,
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:43.020]   because that could be entirely wrong.
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:47.140]   In fact, there's never been a modern census of Afghanistan.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:50.020]   So when journalists say, Pashtuns are the majority,
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:53.260]   they're the biggest group, I would say not so fast.
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:55.620]   I would say not so fast because of migration
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:41:00.100]   is one major issue, no major modern census.
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:01.300]   Actually, the Soviets got pretty close,
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.100]   but didn't quite, you know, find something comprehensive
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:06.340]   and didn't publicize it, knowing that it was,
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:09.100]   you know, modern times, ethnicity can be the source
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:11.100]   of political mobilization.
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:14.780]   It's not innately so, but it's been part of the story.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:16.060]   But then you have mixed families, right?
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:17.780]   So a lot of people you'll meet,
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.180]   you'll encounter in the diaspora and around.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:24.180]   I mean, well, I am, you know, my one parent is Tajik,
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:26.240]   one is Pashtun, right?
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.020]   Or I'm Pashtun, as I mentioned before,
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:30.020]   but I don't speak Pashto, right?
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:35.020]   Or I am Hazara, but you read about us as Shi'i Hazaras.
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:38.140]   In fact, I'm a Sunni Hazara, or I'm a secular Hazara,
[01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:39.420]   or I'm an atheist Hazara.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.940]   I mean, everything's possible, right?
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:46.140]   One of my friends, if he were here,
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:49.140]   he'd say, "I'm Kabuli, I'm from Kabul."
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:51.180]   So if you think about it in Russian terms,
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:53.260]   you know, it means a lot if you're a Muscovite,
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:56.100]   you know, if you're from Pisa or Moscow,
[01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:57.060]   I mean, you know.
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:00.980]   - Yeah, well, even here, there's Bostonians,
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:04.460]   Texans, Californians.
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:07.340]   - Yeah, yeah, East Coast, West Coast, all that stuff.
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:08.800]   Those are all part of the mix here.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.980]   So you asked about Kandahar and Helmand,
[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:14.180]   then I would say, yeah, if you go out to,
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:17.700]   you know, a pomegranate field,
[01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:20.980]   you'll meet a guy who may reckon time differently
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:24.860]   from you and me, who may not be literate,
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:27.900]   he may not have ever had a geography lesson,
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:30.780]   but if you go one door over, you may meet a guy
[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:36.020]   who, you know, whose life path has taken him
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:38.500]   to live in, you know, six countries.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.340]   He may speak five languages.
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:41.420]   And these are all things I'm not saying,
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:42.780]   they're all, these are just because people,
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:44.060]   you know, have money, can go fly around.
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:46.860]   I mean, they're people who were displaced by war
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:48.500]   from late 1970s, right?
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:50.180]   Even already in the early '70s,
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:53.620]   people were traveling by the tens of thousands to Iran,
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.220]   you know, as labor migrants.
[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:56.980]   And once you get to Iran, once you get to Pakistan,
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:59.500]   once you get to Uzbekistan,
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:02.620]   you then connect to all kinds of cosmopolitan cultures.
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:04.900]   In fact, I think one of the themes of the book,
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:06.020]   you know, that you may or may not have read,
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:07.940]   it may put you to sleep, you know,
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:09.580]   Afghan Modern was about, you know,
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:11.820]   conceptualizing Afghanistan as a cosmopolitan place
[01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:14.860]   where for centuries, people went on the move
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:15.700]   and trade in this area.
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:17.900]   You think of, you know, I think this mischaracterization
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:20.620]   of places like Helmand and Kandahar, you know,
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:24.420]   you fly in or you're part of a Marine battalion
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.580]   and you see people there and they look different.
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:30.180]   And I think in our imagination, if I can generalize,
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:33.100]   you know, they look like they've been there for millennia,
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.180]   right, the dress, the whatever, right?
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:36.020]   You think of technology,
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:38.660]   you think of the mud compounds and so on,
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:42.700]   you think of, you know, animal drawn transportation,
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:43.900]   that kind of stuff, right?
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:46.620]   Or the motorbike, right, at most is what they have.
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:49.200]   But in fact, if you follow those families,
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:51.900]   their trade has taken them to Northern India
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:53.060]   for centuries, right?
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:56.220]   The trade has connected them to cosmopolitan centers.
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:58.020]   You know, say they have a scholar in the family,
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:00.580]   that scholar may have studied all over the Middle East,
[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:02.180]   South Asia, right?
[01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:03.940]   You know, their ancestors may have been horse traders
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:05.620]   who went all the way to Moscow, right?
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:07.840]   I mean, we have a sort of records of all these people
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:12.580]   traveling across Eurasia, pursuing all kinds of livelihoods.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:14.420]   And so Afghanistan is this paradox
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:17.280]   of visually looking remote
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:20.260]   and looking like it's kind of stuck in time,
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:23.740]   but the family trajectories and the current trajectories
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:26.420]   are astoundingly cosmopolitan and mobile.
[01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:29.860]   And so, and a conception of being a world center
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:30.900]   is also quite strong.
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:33.260]   So, you know, another way to frame that question
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:36.220]   about like, do they know about 9/11 would be like,
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.420]   why should we know about 9/11?
[01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:39.660]   Because we are at the center of something important, right?
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:41.140]   We are the center of Asia.
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:42.900]   We are the heart of Asia.
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:44.540]   We have a kind of historic greatness.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:48.900]   We are, you know, a proud culture of our own achievements.
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:51.780]   Right, so we're not worried about that, right?
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:54.340]   That said, I mean, sure, there are different narratives
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:56.100]   about why Americans are there,
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:57.860]   why people are being killed.
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:00.300]   You know, of course you'd find, you know,
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:03.180]   they want to convert us, you know, they want our gold,
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:06.580]   they want our opium, they want X, Y, and Z, right?
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:10.700]   There was a recent story about a Taliban official
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:12.500]   sitting in an office in Kabul and a journalist asked him,
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:15.900]   can you find in this rotating globe, find your country,
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:17.900]   find where we're sitting right now.
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:21.460]   And he was filmed not being able to do it.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:22.380]   And so a lot of, you know,
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:24.260]   race-fiscated Afghans in the diaspora were saying,
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:25.900]   you know, ha ha, look at this.
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:27.260]   And that exists.
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.860]   I mean, I think I could go to my Stanford classroom
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.380]   and there'd be a lot of kids who wouldn't know
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:32.620]   where Afghanistan is too, right?
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:35.580]   But I guess I wouldn't use those metrics
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:38.260]   to suggest that this is a place
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:40.340]   that doesn't have a sense of its place in the world
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:42.300]   and of geopolitics.
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:44.500]   I think if anything, being a relatively small country
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.620]   in a very complicated neighborhood,
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.340]   I mean, everybody, every cab driver,
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:50.620]   I mean, people have a, I mean,
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:52.420]   you know, this is where America is different
[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:54.340]   because I don't think Americans have this sense.
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:55.860]   You know, we're talking about Moscow and stuff.
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:58.780]   I think, you know, Moscow cab drivers,
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:02.300]   I think a lot of them are gonna tell you, like,
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:04.460]   what's happening in the world and why, right?
[01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:07.020]   And it's just part of their thing, right?
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:07.940]   You can find that in Ghana.
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:09.140]   You can find that in Mexico City, right?
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:10.220]   You find that lots of places.
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:13.660]   So I think Afghans are part of a very sophisticated
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:17.940]   kind of mapping of the world and where they fit in.
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:20.020]   And a lot of them remarkably had done it firsthand,
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.340]   which is what struck me so much.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:22.980]   And, you know, relating my experiences
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:24.460]   from the 1990s in touch camp places
[01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:26.380]   that these guys had already lived
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.420]   in more countries than I'd ever been.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:30.140]   They already knew half those languages.
[01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:33.220]   I mean, this one friend's Russian was impeccable.
[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:34.980]   And of course it helped.
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:36.460]   They had Russian girlfriends.
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:38.780]   They had, you know, they mixed with the police.
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:39.620]   They had run-ins.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:42.940]   I mean, this wasn't something you got from a book, right?
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:44.940]   This was like hard knock life.
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:47.620]   I mean, one friend was from a wealthy family
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:51.180]   in this trading diaspora and he was imprisoned.
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:54.060]   I mean, they sent him to prison in Pakistan
[01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:57.140]   and he talks about how he started like running,
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:46:59.900]   running the jail, you know, taking cigarettes to people,
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:02.860]   doing little things and kind of, you know,
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:05.140]   these are not stories of like, oh, I went to Harvard
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:06.860]   and so I'm so learned because of this.
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:08.860]   I mean, it's a whole range of experiences.
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:10.900]   - The interesting thing is the survey is a survey
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:15.900]   and it doesn't reflect ignorance, as you're saying perhaps,
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:22.460]   but it may reflect a different geopolitical view
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:25.660]   of the world than the West has.
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:29.300]   So if, you know, for a lot of the world,
[01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:33.260]   9/11 was one of the most important moments
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:35.620]   of recent human history.
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:38.580]   And for Afghanistan to not to know that,
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:41.460]   especially when they're part of that story,
[01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:43.120]   means they have a very different,
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:46.180]   like there could be a lot of things said.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:49.700]   One is the spread of information is different.
[01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:52.580]   The channels of the way information is spread
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:54.940]   and two, the things they care about.
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:59.940]   Maybe they see themselves as part of a longer arc
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:03.980]   of history where the bickering of these superpowers
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:07.840]   that seem to want to go to the moon are not as important
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.300]   as the big sort of arc that's been the story of Afghanistan.
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:17.220]   That's an interesting idea, but it's still a bit,
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:20.100]   if at all representative of the truth.
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:23.380]   It's heartbreaking that they're not,
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:28.380]   do not see themselves as active player
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:33.720]   in this game between the United States and Central Asia,
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:37.460]   because there's such a critical player.
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:41.620]   And I feel, and obviously in many ways,
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:44.340]   get the short end of the stick in this whole interaction
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:49.340]   with the, you know, invasion of Afghanistan for many years.
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:54.540]   And then this rushed withdrawal of troops
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:59.540]   and now the economic collapse and it's,
[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:04.100]   it's sad in some ways.
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:05.220]   - No, it's very, I mean, you know,
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:06.740]   another way to put it is this.
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:08.860]   I mean, yeah, there's a range of knowledge
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:10.660]   and you're right, the information flows
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:14.260]   are peculiar to particular geographies
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:15.100]   and histories and stuff.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:17.340]   I think that, you know, plucking out one sample
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:20.220]   from some fairly remote area,
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.740]   from one like follow the agricultural products.
[01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:24.940]   I mean, and this is where, you know,
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:29.540]   I think urban rural divides used to mean a lot more
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:30.480]   in the 19th century, right?
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:32.720]   So a lot of like nuts and bolts of history
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:35.620]   is about conceiving of these kinds of distinctions,
[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:37.940]   you know, but I think that if one has the privilege
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:40.780]   of traveling a bit, you see that like urban areas
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:43.420]   are fed by rural hinterlands.
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:46.380]   And if you look, think of who actually, you know,
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:48.220]   brings the bread, the milk, you know,
[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.740]   pomegranates and so on, it creates these networks
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:53.620]   and then, you know, mobility channels,
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:54.940]   information and so on.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:57.220]   But yeah, but your broader point
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:58.060]   about like the tragedy of this,
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:01.140]   I mean, I guess if I can quote a brilliant student of mine,
[01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:04.220]   an Afghan American woman who just received her PhD,
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:07.980]   who's now, you know, doctor, he's a great scholar.
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.620]   You know, we've done several events now
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:11.980]   trying to just think through what's happened
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.620]   and of course she's very emotionally affected by it
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:17.340]   and she continues to ask a really great question.
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:19.780]   If I can get her phrasing right, you know,
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:21.140]   if you think of the cycle of like
[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.540]   the Taliban being in power in 2001
[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:25.700]   and the way in which that affected women in particular,
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:28.980]   you know, half Afghan, half of society, right?
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:31.020]   Then you think of this 20 year period of violence
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:34.380]   and, you know, missed exits, right?
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:38.340]   And repeated tragedy, but also it created a space.
[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:40.020]   I mean, it created a space for a whole,
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:41.380]   I'd say generationally, it created a sense,
[01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:44.420]   a space for people to realize something new.
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:47.060]   And I think, so we have to attend to the dynamism
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:47.900]   of the society, right?
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:51.140]   So yeah, this happened mostly in Kabul,
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:53.940]   other big cities, Mazar-e-Sharif, Herat, Kandahar,
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:56.740]   but you can't limit your analysis to that
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:00.580]   because things like radio, television,
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.380]   everyone got a TV channel.
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:05.380]   There's a wonderful documentary called Afghan Star
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:07.460]   that I recommend to your listeners and viewers
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:10.660]   that it's about a singing show, a singing contest show,
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:12.140]   but you see just for some of these things
[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:14.100]   about like connections, I mean,
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:17.980]   it's a show by an independent television network
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:21.220]   that did drama, it did kind of infomercials
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:24.340]   for the government and huge American investment in it.
[01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:25.580]   So it wasn't politically neutral,
[01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:27.700]   but it did talk shows, did all this kind of stuff.
[01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:31.860]   But it did a singing show that became incredibly popular,
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:33.820]   modeled upon the British American,
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:36.300]   American Idol kind of stuff, and you can vote.
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:39.060]   So it had a kind of democratic practice element,
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:41.300]   but it's fascinating to see that, you know,
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:44.820]   people hooked up generators to televisions and watch this.
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:47.020]   You know, you think of like literacy rates.
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:48.940]   Literacy rates are imperfect and, you know,
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:51.620]   people who study, you know, medieval or modern Europe
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:54.900]   talk about how, yeah, no one could read
[01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:56.140]   and there weren't many books,
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:58.740]   but if someone had a book, it'd be read aloud
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:00.380]   to a whole village potentially or a gathering.
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.540]   So there was much, you know,
[01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:02.380]   some of these metrics don't get
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:05.220]   what people actually perceive as information or exposure
[01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:08.940]   because there's a magnifying power of open spaces
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:11.580]   and hearing radio in group settings,
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:13.860]   seeing television group settings,
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:16.300]   having telephone, you know, cheap telephones,
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:19.460]   which then become an access point to the world
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:20.420]   and social media, right?
[01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:23.180]   So all this stuff swept across Afghan society
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:28.180]   as it did elsewhere, you know, in the last decade or more.
[01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:31.220]   So Afghan society became, you know, in important ways,
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:33.340]   really connected to everything going on.
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:34.500]   And so you see that reflected politically
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:35.340]   in what people wanted.
[01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:37.380]   So you had some people, obviously,
[01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:39.100]   back to return to the Taliban.
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.300]   Some people wanted the status quo,
[01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:44.340]   but increasingly many more people wanted something else.
[01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:45.780]   And one of the great failures was
[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:48.060]   to expose people to democracy,
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:50.100]   but only give them the rigged version.
[01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:52.880]   And so the US, you know, the State Department in particular,
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.140]   continued to double down on faked elections
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:57.940]   for the parliament and for the presidency in Afghanistan.
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.100]   - What kind of elections?
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:02.220]   - Faked, fraudulent elections for parliament
[01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:06.820]   and for president in Afghanistan again and again
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:08.380]   from the very beginning.
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:12.340]   And those elections were partly theater for the US,
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:14.460]   like for remaining on the road that you're describing,
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:15.900]   right, for not deviating, for not exiting,
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:18.740]   because we were building democracy there.
[01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:19.900]   In reality, the US government knew
[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:22.040]   it was never really building democracy there.
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:24.180]   It was establishing control.
[01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:27.140]   And elections were one means to gather control, right?
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:28.540]   But then you had on the ground,
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:30.620]   especially among young people,
[01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:32.780]   going to university, you know,
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:36.260]   having experiences that were denied to them before,
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:37.700]   you know, they took these problems so seriously.
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:40.140]   So part of the disillusionment that we see today
[01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:43.400]   is that, you know, they believe what the US told them,
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:45.180]   that they're constructing democracy.
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:46.620]   And of course, you know, setting a psychos,
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:48.060]   maybe thinking, well, you know,
[01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:50.500]   you're not really doing that, you're backing fraud.
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.260]   - They believed it when they were younger
[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:54.140]   and now they're actually smart enough
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:55.940]   to understand that it's a farce.
[01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:56.780]   - Yeah.
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:53:59.220]   - But in so indirectly had the consequence
[01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:00.180]   of actually working.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:01.140]   (laughing)
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:01.980]   - Yeah.
[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:03.580]   - And that it taught the young,
[01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:05.300]   well, over a period of 20 years,
[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:08.500]   young folks to believe that democracy is possible
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:10.940]   and then to realize what democracy is not.
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:11.780]   - Exactly.
[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:12.600]   - Just the current system.
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:13.440]   - Beautifully said, beautifully said.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:14.700]   And so, but now look at us,
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:17.980]   now it's, you know, it's now November.
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:21.700]   And so this whole period,
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:23.380]   and I wouldn't say like, you know,
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:25.620]   I wouldn't cast the last 20 years
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:27.860]   if we're looking at all the achievements, you know,
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:30.300]   I wouldn't put them in an American tally sheet,
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:31.700]   like, oh, this is something
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:32.740]   we should pat ourselves on the back for.
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:34.640]   I think that much has happened actually
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:36.020]   against what the Americans wanted.
[01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:41.020]   I mean, that the kind of free thinking, democracy wanting,
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:43.300]   I mean, even like, yeah, we could point out on the religious
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:44.140]   go back to the religious sphere.
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:47.860]   I mean, the African religious landscape
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:49.380]   became very pluralistic.
[01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:51.660]   Lots of young people wanted
[01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:53.500]   a different kind of secular politics.
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:57.980]   But the old guard who wanted the status quo
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:00.980]   and wanted something that they'd fought for in 1980s
[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:04.100]   tended to still get American backing as the political elites
[01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:06.960]   who still tended to monopolize political power.
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:09.560]   So all stuff was happening in different ways.
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.600]   I mean, the Americans established this
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:12.880]   American University of Afghanistan,
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.640]   which was I think one of the best things the US did there.
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:18.080]   And I regret that the US didn't fund 20 more,
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:20.000]   you know, strengthen them across the country,
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:20.840]   make them accessible people.
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:23.240]   Because it was, you know, again,
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:26.480]   it wasn't an engine of Americanization.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:27.320]   It was just opportunity.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.720]   And so the thirst for higher education
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:29.920]   is really extraordinary there.
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:31.100]   It was never really met.
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:34.240]   The US tended to put money in primary education,
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:37.120]   which much of that too was fraudulent.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.480]   But so you have all this interesting dynamism.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:42.280]   You have, you know, the arts, you have a critical space.
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:43.720]   I mean, I call it a public sphere
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.760]   in the classic European sense.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:46.880]   You know, the Afghans made of their own.
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:49.240]   And again, it wasn't Americanization.
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:51.560]   It wasn't imposed.
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:54.280]   It was something that Afghans built across generations,
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:58.400]   but really with a firm foundation among youth
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:01.660]   who wanted importantly, a multi-ethnic Afghan society.
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:03.740]   You asked about postings and that kind of stuff.
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:06.500]   And a lot of that language in recent years
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:09.860]   was they were aware that the US-backed government
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:11.900]   was playing ethnic politics
[01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:14.500]   and trying to kind of put people in the blocks
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:17.880]   and mobilize people based on their ethnic identity.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.860]   And there was a younger cohort of people who said,
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:21.580]   you know, we are Afghan.
[01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:23.300]   And it's interesting social media stuff
[01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:25.620]   where people would say, I am Hazara,
[01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:28.380]   but I'm also Tajik, I'm also Uzbek.
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.440]   I mean, it was a way of creating
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:33.600]   a multi-ethnic Afghan national identity
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.000]   that embraced everything.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.880]   I mean, very utopian, you know, super utopian, right?
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:39.280]   But symbolically it was very important
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:42.980]   that they rejected being mobilized politically,
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:45.400]   you know, voting as a Hazara or voting as whatever.
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.880]   And of course there were communities
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:50.720]   who wanted to vote as that ethnic community.
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:52.240]   But there were also people who said, you know,
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:55.120]   let's put a kind of civic nationalism first,
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.800]   one that accommodates ethnic pluralism
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:00.240]   in a way that rejected a kind of majoritarian politics
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:03.440]   of one ethnic group dominating the thing.
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:04.640]   So all this stuff was quite interesting.
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:07.180]   I mean, women were asserting themselves
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:09.640]   in across multiple spheres.
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:10.800]   Of course it remained patriarchal.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:11.620]   Of course there were struggles.
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:12.460]   Of course there was violence.
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:14.220]   Of course, you know, there's no utopia.
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:18.880]   But the door on all that shut on August 15.
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:22.080]   So to go back to the quote that I wanted to offer
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:25.640]   from the student, now professor,
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:28.560]   was it, you know, in trying to make sense of this,
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.960]   and you mentioned the tragic arc here,
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:35.120]   you think of the 20 years, like she asked, you know,
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.640]   why did you go to war in our country?
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:39.280]   Basically, why did you do this to us for 20 years
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.480]   when this was never about us?
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:43.920]   You know, you never asked us if you wanted to come.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.440]   You never asked us what you wanted to build here.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:47.480]   You didn't ask us when you were coming
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:49.440]   and you didn't ask us when you were leaving.
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:51.500]   You just did this all on your own.
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:53.840]   And we tried to make the most of it.
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:55.880]   And then you pulled the rug out from under us,
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:58:00.480]   you know, at the 11th hour and returned to power,
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:02.120]   partly by diplomacy.
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:04.480]   It wasn't at the end, just a military loss.
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:07.000]   I mean, it was a series of diplomatic decisions.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.520]   I mean, the idea, you asked about alternatives.
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:12.760]   I mean, giving up Bagram, I mean, holding to the timeline.
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:14.280]   I mean, the Biden people did not need to hold
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:17.660]   to the Doha agreement that Trump had signed.
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:19.840]   I mean, every American president
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:21.960]   writes his or her own foreign policy, right?
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:24.600]   So the Biden administration acted as if,
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:27.360]   and they tried to convince us that their hands were tied
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:31.400]   and that it was either this or 20 more years of war
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:36.080]   or some absurd kind of false alternative.
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:38.040]   And so, but I think that's important
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:40.040]   for American audiences to hear that, you know,
[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:42.240]   they're like, you came to here to experiment.
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:44.240]   You came here to punish.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:47.880]   You came here to kind of reassert, you know,
[01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:49.920]   your dominance at the world stage,
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:53.520]   you know, to work out the fear and hurt of 9/11
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:55.120]   that we talked about, which was so real, you know,
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:58.280]   and palpable and so important for American politics
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:58:59.120]   since then.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:01.240]   Like you worked out your problems, you know,
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:06.240]   on us, on our territory, and now what do we have for it?
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.880]   You know, and then the people who had a stake
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:12.280]   in that system, imperfect as it was,
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:13.780]   have been desperate to leave.
[01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:15.680]   And so this, I don't know how much people are aware of this,
[01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:18.000]   but, you know, I'm a scholar.
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.080]   I work in California, you know, I have friends.
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:24.800]   I edited a journal on Afghanistan and, you know,
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:26.880]   but I'm not a politician, I'm not a soldier,
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.840]   but people assume that, you know,
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:31.200]   Afghans have been desperately trying to reach me
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:34.800]   and anyone who is kind of on the radar as an American
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:36.080]   to help get them out.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:39.520]   You know, that's the kind of like, you know,
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.320]   the symbol of voting with your feet, you know,
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.160]   is quite powerful.
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:46.000]   I mean, there's a huge swath of society
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000]   that doesn't want the system and is literally
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.640]   living in terror about it.
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:51.960]   Naturally, women, you know, I mean,
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:53.920]   especially women of a certain age, I mean,
[01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:54.840]   they feel like their lives are over.
[01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:56.880]   I mean, there is an epidemic of suicide.
[01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:02.440]   They feel betrayed and some people have done
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:03.600]   some good things in getting people out.
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:05.800]   You know, I mean, some, you know,
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:08.200]   the US military vets have been, you know,
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:11.040]   at the forefront of working to get out people,
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:14.600]   you know, that they know they owe.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:17.640]   But the US government doesn't want these people.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:19.720]   I mean, they have created all these obstacles
[02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:24.720]   to allowing a safety valve for people to leave.
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:27.880]   - Looking forward from a perspective of leadership,
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:31.200]   how do we avoid these kinds of mistakes?
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:35.320]   So obviously some interests, some aspects of human nature
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.720]   led to this war.
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:37.560]   - Yeah.
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:39.200]   - How do we resist that in the future?
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:44.600]   - I guess beyond my moral and intellectual capacity,
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:45.440]   I'll just say this.
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:46.480]   I mean, looking at it, again, looking at it from,
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:48.040]   you know, my home ground is the university
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:53.040]   and I think of the intellectual, you know,
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:55.960]   ways of thinking that I think students
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:59.120]   should develop for themselves as citizens, right?
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:02.000]   Maybe that's where to start is like historical thinking.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.680]   I mean, these are all, you know,
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:04.960]   I try to tell people, you know,
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:07.520]   if you want to do robotics, computer science,
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:08.760]   you'd be a doctor or whatever.
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:10.160]   - You should study history.
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:11.760]   - Yeah, I mean, you don't have to be an historian like me
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:13.360]   and it's, you know, my job isn't perfect.
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:15.160]   My profession is deeply flawed, right?
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:17.680]   But as I get older, I'm like,
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:19.360]   there are fewer and fewer historians actually like,
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:20.520]   you know, I want to hang out with and stuff.
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:22.280]   So it's like, I'm not offering myself
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:24.280]   as like a model for anything, but you know,
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:26.480]   whether you're a, you know, you carry the mail
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:27.880]   or you're a brain surgeon, whatever.
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:30.560]   I mean, I think it's a way of civic engagement
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:32.760]   and a way of like, you know, ethical being in the world
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:34.560]   that we need to familiarize ourselves with.
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:36.000]   Because if you're an American
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.200]   or if you're from a rich country, you know,
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.280]   you need to be aware of your effect
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.280]   on an interesting world.
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:45.120]   You can't say anymore that you don't know or care
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:46.840]   what's happening in Afghanistan
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:49.600]   or really circle the globe and point to a place.
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:52.080]   I mean, we're all connected and we're all,
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.480]   we have ethical obligations.
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:55.960]   That's one place to start, but I would just say this,
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:57.560]   and this is a, I'll offer a self critique,
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:01.160]   and that is so much of my teaching
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:03.040]   and like the themes of my research have been about empire.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:05.440]   You know, how big states work,
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:07.480]   not only on big territories like the Russian empire
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:08.320]   and Soviet Union and stuff,
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:11.440]   but the way in which power often, you know,
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:13.000]   is projected beyond those boundaries
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.120]   in ways that we don't see.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.920]   So this is where things like neoliberalism
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:18.800]   or just, you know, if you want to take capitalism
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:20.840]   or just things that, you know,
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:24.880]   the idea of humanity or of liberalism or of humanitarianism,
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:26.880]   ideas that move beyond state boundaries
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:29.400]   are all things that we think about
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:30.720]   as affecting power in some ways
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:33.680]   that often harm people, right?
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:36.120]   So I think part of, as I've seen my job so far
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:37.640]   is to think about, you know,
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:39.960]   building upon the work of my people in grad school
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:42.160]   and, you know, scholars that have affected me.
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:44.880]   I mean, you know, we're all concerned with how power works
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:48.240]   and its effects and trying to be attuned to
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:51.000]   understanding things that aren't visible, right?
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:51.880]   That we should be thinking about,
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:52.960]   that should be known to us.
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:55.280]   And as scholars, we can hopefully play some useful role
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:00.280]   in showing effects that aren't, you know, obvious initially.
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:03.200]   So empire is a framework to think about this.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:05.920]   And so you think about evading foreign countries,
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:07.960]   obviously, if you're a scholar of empire,
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:09.520]   you've seen what that looks like,
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:11.600]   and that's horrific, right?
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:13.040]   You look at things like racism
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:16.720]   as one of the ideological pillars of empire,
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:18.280]   you know, that's horrific, it must be critiqued,
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:20.880]   it must be, you know, we must be educated against.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:24.080]   Some of the, you know, gender exploitation of empire
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.400]   is also something to highlight, you know,
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:26.600]   to rectify and so on.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:28.600]   You know, to be moral beings,
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:31.240]   we need to think about past inequality
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:35.160]   and the legacies of violence and destruction that live on.
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:37.360]   I mean, living in the Americas, I mean, look at, you know,
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:41.360]   we're all on stolen land, we're all in the sense,
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:43.720]   living with the fruits of genocide and slavery
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:44.800]   and all those things that are hard
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:46.960]   to come to terms with, right?
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:49.680]   But the last few months in Afghanistan,
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:53.360]   and thinking about empire, I think made me more humble
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:58.040]   when I read people who say, to put it simply,
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:00.400]   have taken some joy in this moment, saying like,
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.920]   well, the Americans got kicked out of Afghanistan.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:07.040]   You know, if you're against empire, this is a good thing.
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:09.580]   This is a kind of victory of anti-colonial.
[02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:14.000]   - You could see from the perspective of Afghanistan
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.920]   that America is not some kind of place
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:19.860]   that has an ideal of freedom and all the kind of things
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:21.960]   that we American tell ourselves,
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:25.800]   but it's more America has the ideal of empire,
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.440]   that there's one place that has the truth
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:31.720]   and everybody else must follow this truth.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:34.280]   And so from a perspective of Afghanistan,
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:36.400]   it could be a victory against this idea
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.660]   of centralized truth of empire.
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:41.600]   That's another way to tell this story.
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:43.440]   And then in that sense, it's a victory.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:46.560]   And in that sense also, I mean,
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:49.300]   you push back against this somewhat,
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:54.600]   this idea of Afghanistan as the graveyard of empire.
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:56.160]   - Right, right.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:58.560]   And I'll say this, I'd say, you know, I mean,
[02:04:58.560 --> 02:04:59.980]   I'm a critic of empire.
[02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:04.080]   I mean, you know, colonialism is a political phenomenon
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:05.040]   that stays with us.
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:07.920]   And I think, you know, we need scholars to point to the way
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:10.120]   in which it still works and still does harm.
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:12.840]   But it's part of being an empire
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:15.760]   that you can just get up and leave a place, right?
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:19.800]   That you can remake its politics on one day
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:22.600]   and then because it fails to advance your agenda
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:26.160]   at one moment, you simply walk away.
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:27.840]   I mean, you know, we can point to other moments.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:30.860]   I mean, 1947 on the subcontinent, you know,
[02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:32.860]   the way that the British withdrew
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:37.780]   played a significant role in mass violence,
[02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:40.100]   you know, that accompanied partition.
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:43.200]   It wasn't all the actions of the British that, you know,
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:44.380]   dictated that, right?
[02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:47.660]   There were lots of actors who chose to pick up, you know,
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:49.860]   the knife to kill their neighbor and so on.
[02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:52.020]   I mean, there's lots of agency in that moment
[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:54.700]   as there is now in what's happening in Afghanistan.
[02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:57.700]   But I think the capriciousness, I mean,
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:06:02.700]   the ability to act as if your political decisions
[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:06.400]   about other people's lives, you know,
[02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:09.600]   or something that can be made, you know, in secret,
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:11.860]   that can be made willy-nilly,
[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:14.620]   that really are beyond the accountability, you know,
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:17.300]   of those who are actually going to live with
[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:20.620]   the consequences of shifting the cards on a deck
[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:23.500]   in a way that decides who rules and who doesn't.
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:25.460]   - I would love to hear your conversation
[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:28.460]   with somebody I just talked to, which is Neil Ferguson,
[02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:30.980]   who argues on the topic of empire,
[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:34.700]   that you can also zoom out even further
[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:38.220]   and say, weigh the good and the bad of empire.
[02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:41.260]   And he argues, I think he gets a lot of flack for this
[02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:45.780]   from other historians, that like the British empire
[02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:50.420]   did more good than bad in certain moments of history.
[02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:52.860]   And that's an uncomfortable truth.
[02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:55.340]   There's like levels, it's a cake
[02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:57.900]   with layers of uncomfortable truths.
[02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:00.820]   And it's not a cake at all because none of it tastes good.
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:01.660]   - Right.
[02:07:01.660 --> 02:07:04.180]   I mean, I would continue to disagree with Neil Ferguson.
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:06.500]   So I'm still working out where I am
[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.820]   and what this moment does to kind of, I think,
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:12.020]   qualify my understanding of the past
[02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:15.500]   into, I think, in a moment of humility, you know, I do,
[02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:18.260]   and I'm probably reacting to the kind of, you know,
[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:20.620]   as you put it, I mean, the idea that this is like
[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:23.180]   a good thing that American power has been defeated here.
[02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:25.820]   I mean, I do think American power should contract.
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:29.220]   And I don't think, and again, if I had to create
[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:32.060]   a tally sheet of what the Americans did in the US,
[02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:34.620]   I mean, I mentioned the American University of Afghanistan.
[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:35.500]   Right?
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:37.700]   It could have done that without invading the country
[02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:38.540]   and killing people.
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:41.500]   You know, I've not now become an apologist for empire.
[02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:44.460]   I'm not now a mini Neil Ferguson,
[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:48.740]   but, you know, ending empire is, I mean,
[02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:53.740]   those decisions you make are in some ways
[02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:56.620]   a continuation of imperial hubris, right?
[02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:59.380]   So you're not really out of empire yet.
[02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:01.020]   You're not really contracting empire
[02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:03.500]   for those who are living it, you know?
[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:05.580]   But I think it's also, I mean, maybe I put it this way,
[02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:08.140]   it's be careful what you ask for.
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:11.000]   You know, I mean, I wanted the US out of Afghanistan,
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.980]   but I wanted there to be a political settlement.
[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:16.980]   I wanted, you know, I wanted my cake
[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:18.100]   and I wanted to eat it too, right?
[02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:20.580]   I wanted all kinds of things to be different, right?
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:22.740]   - But why is going to Afghanistan even needed for that?
[02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:26.260]   You can play all of those games of geopolitics
[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:30.140]   without ever invading and taking ownership of the place.
[02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:31.660]   It feels like the war.
[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:32.500]   - Yeah.
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:35.660]   - It feels like, I mean, I'm not exactly sure
[02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:38.420]   what military force is necessary for,
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:41.820]   except for targeted intense attacks.
[02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:46.500]   It feels like to me, the right thing to do after 9/11
[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:49.940]   was to show what was a display of force
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:52.040]   unlike anything the world has ever seen
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:54.180]   for a very short amount of time,
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:08:57.220]   targeted at, sure, a terrorist,
[02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:59.620]   at certain strongholds and so on.
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:00.460]   - Yeah.
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:03.460]   - And then in and out, and then focus on education,
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:08.460]   on empowering women into the education system,
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:10.700]   all those kinds of things that have to do
[02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:13.940]   with supporting the culture, the education,
[02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:16.380]   the flourishing of the place.
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:21.220]   It has nothing to do with military policing, essentially.
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.060]   - Right.
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:25.060]   I mean, I think, yeah, if you look at it through that lens,
[02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:28.060]   I mean, invading Afghanistan and then invading Iraq
[02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:33.060]   didn't end Al-Qaeda, it didn't end terrorism, right?
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:37.420]   It didn't really deflate these ideologies entirely.
[02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:42.540]   If you like, you could say there were some
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:47.180]   limited discrediting of certain kinds of ideas.
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:48.540]   But in fact, I mean, look at the phenomenon
[02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:50.620]   of suicide bombing.
[02:09:50.620 --> 02:09:51.700]   I mean, it spread.
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:53.780]   I mean, it was never an Islamic thing.
[02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:55.420]   It was never a Muslim thing.
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:58.140]   Some Muslims adopted it in some places,
[02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:00.780]   but the circuits of knowledge about how to do
[02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:02.780]   these kind of things only expanded
[02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:05.740]   with the insurgencies that emerged in Afghanistan and Iraq,
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:06.900]   and then they kind of became connected,
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:08.420]   and then they became to the present.
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:10.260]   I mean, the Islamic State is,
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:12.620]   it's the best thing that happened to the Taliban ever,
[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:17.140]   because it's on the basis of its supposed new stance
[02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:20.100]   as a counter-terrorism outfit,
[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:22.500]   that it will get recognition from all its neighbors.
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:24.420]   It will get recognition in Russia.
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:26.900]   I mean, already with the evacuation of the airport,
[02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:29.380]   the United States was collaborating with the Taliban
[02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:33.540]   against the Islamic State and openly talking
[02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:34.980]   about the Taliban as if they were partners
[02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:35.820]   in this great operation.
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:39.300]   So, and then Al-Qaeda remains present in Afghanistan.
[02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:42.300]   - So, trillions of dollars spent.
[02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:43.860]   - Yeah.
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:48.540]   - The drones up above bombing places
[02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:51.220]   that result in civilian death, the death of children,
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:53.260]   the death of fathers and mothers,
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:56.100]   and those stories, even at the individual level,
[02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:58.980]   propagate virally across the land,
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:01.740]   creating potentially more terrorists.
[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:04.940]   And a cynical view of the trillions of dollars
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:08.500]   is the military-industrial complex,
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:10.660]   where there's just a momentum,
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:15.660]   where after 9/11, the feeling like we should do something
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:18.780]   led to us doing something,
[02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:21.620]   and then a lot of people realizing they can make money
[02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:23.540]   from doing more of that something.
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:25.420]   And then it's just the momentum,
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:29.500]   where no one person is sitting there petting a cat
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:32.340]   in an evil way, saying, "We're going to spend
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:34.540]   "all of this money and create more suffering
[02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:36.140]   "and create more terrorism."
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:37.900]   But it's just something about that momentum
[02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:39.300]   that leads to that.
[02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:42.580]   And to me, honestly, I'm still a sucker.
[02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:43.980]   I believe in leadership.
[02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:47.540]   I believe in great charismatic leaders
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:51.540]   and the power of that one to do evil and to do good.
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:56.500]   And it felt like, I honestly put the blame
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:12:01.500]   on George Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:03.060]   for the lack of leadership in this.
[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:05.140]   - Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[02:12:05.140 --> 02:12:07.540]   I agree, yeah, there is the military-industrial complex
[02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:09.420]   component, which is huge.
[02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:11.340]   And there's also, I mean, speaking of government leadership,
[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:14.340]   it's also, I'd say, the imbalance of power
[02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:15.180]   within Washington.
[02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:18.780]   I mean, the Pentagon used this moment,
[02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:24.700]   well, beginning in 2001, I think, to assert its authority
[02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:27.980]   at the expense of other institutions of national government.
[02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:30.340]   I mean, the State Department diplomacy
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:35.060]   has become a shadow of what it was once capable of doing.
[02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:38.020]   And of course, I mean, other historians, US historians,
[02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:39.700]   which I'm not, formally a historian of the United States,
[02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:42.100]   but we can go back to talk about Vietnam.
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:44.420]   We talk about lots of Cold War
[02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:46.260]   and post-Cold War engagements.
[02:12:46.260 --> 02:12:49.060]   And I think we need a reckoning
[02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:51.780]   about how the United States uses military power,
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:55.260]   why we devote so much to our military budget
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:56.820]   and what could be available to us
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:59.980]   if we had a more sensible view
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:03.100]   of the value of military power, of its effectiveness.
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:04.940]   And I think we're willing to hammer home
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:05.940]   that this was a defeat.
[02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:07.260]   I mean, I think there should be accountability.
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:09.820]   And if you, and this could be a kind of opening
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:11.260]   for a kind of bipartisan conversation,
[02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:16.260]   because if you are a kind of American militarist,
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:18.500]   I mean, you have to look at the leadership
[02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:20.700]   that got you to a place where you were defeated
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:25.700]   by men wearing sandals, firing AK-47s, right?
[02:13:25.700 --> 02:13:27.820]   - Yeah, there should be a humility with that.
[02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:28.660]   - Yeah.
[02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:31.820]   - I mean, we should actually say that,
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:34.220]   like literally the--
[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:35.780]   - Oh, we lost, you should say we lost.
[02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:37.820]   It wasn't just, you know--
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:40.740]   - The American military lost.
[02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:43.660]   - Yeah, and I feel, I have very mixed feelings
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:46.380]   and it's, I don't know, a ton of veterans,
[02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:48.180]   but Mitch and I have topped my share
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:52.380]   and have a student now, and they are suffering
[02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:54.300]   because they look at the sacrifices that they made
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:55.300]   that I didn't make.
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.100]   I mean, American society didn't make the sacrifices.
[02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:59.460]   I mean, men and women lost limbs,
[02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:01.220]   they lost eyes, they lost lives.
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:03.780]   There's been this, of course,
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:08.020]   quiet epidemic of suicide among veterans.
[02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:10.900]   And I've heard some stories,
[02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:12.340]   the fact that the State Department
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:14.780]   is seeing a similar surge of suicides
[02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:19.780]   'cause they see their adult life's work collapse.
[02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:20.780]   They've seen their relationships.
[02:14:20.780 --> 02:14:22.780]   I mean, they've seen, they've received phone calls
[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:24.460]   in the middle of the night from people
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:26.500]   who they entrusted with their lives,
[02:14:26.500 --> 02:14:28.380]   who they know are gonna be targeted.
[02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:30.860]   I mean, some have already been killed.
[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:32.820]   They've seen the, I mean, I think just,
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:35.660]   I'd imagine just ideologically and professionally
[02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:39.300]   what they believed in and what they sacrificed for
[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:41.820]   has vanished.
[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:44.740]   And I think that's bad.
[02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:46.780]   I mean, historically, thinking of some of the precedents
[02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:49.580]   you were thinking of, I mean, if you think of,
[02:14:49.580 --> 02:14:51.340]   first of all, at a human level,
[02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:53.260]   I feel horrible for those people who,
[02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:55.540]   I may not have agreed with everything they had done
[02:14:55.540 --> 02:14:56.660]   and their choices in life,
[02:14:56.660 --> 02:14:59.300]   but I respect the fact that many good people
[02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:03.540]   went out of the best intentions as young people
[02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:05.940]   to do the right thing and make things right.
[02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:07.220]   And I respect that.
[02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:10.020]   And I've met enough to know that there were people
[02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:12.220]   who saw the gray in complexity
[02:15:12.220 --> 02:15:14.500]   and that's all you can hope for.
[02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:19.340]   But we don't want a generation of disillusioned veterans.
[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:23.500]   If we look at the other post-war moments,
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:25.980]   and this is kind of a post-war moment where,
[02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:27.740]   I think we need a conversation with American veterans
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:31.060]   about what they've gone through and what they're feeling.
[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:33.100]   And they still have skin in the game,
[02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:33.980]   because their personal connections
[02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:35.500]   and of their histories-
[02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:37.260]   - And also gonna be future leaders.
[02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:40.260]   I mean, veterans- - Already, yeah.
[02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:43.940]   - People who have served are often great men and women.
[02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:45.100]   That's- - That's true.
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:50.100]   - And throughout history,
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:54.500]   whether you sacrifice, you served in fighting World War II,
[02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:55.940]   in fighting Vietnam,
[02:15:55.940 --> 02:15:58.780]   that's going to mold you in different ways.
[02:15:58.780 --> 02:16:02.620]   That's going to mold how you are as a leader
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:04.740]   that leads this country forward.
[02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:07.180]   And so you have to have an honest conversation
[02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:12.180]   about what was the role of the war in Afghanistan,
[02:16:12.180 --> 02:16:14.980]   the war in the Middle East,
[02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:18.060]   the war on terror in the history of America.
[02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:20.100]   If we just look at the full context
[02:16:20.100 --> 02:16:22.340]   at the end of this 21st century,
[02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:24.420]   how are we going to remember this?
[02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:27.820]   And how that's going to result in our future interactions
[02:16:27.820 --> 02:16:30.540]   with small and large countries,
[02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:32.860]   with China or some proxy war with China,
[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:36.420]   with Russia or some proxy war with Russia.
[02:16:36.420 --> 02:16:38.540]   What's the role of oil and natural resources
[02:16:38.540 --> 02:16:40.620]   and opium and all those kinds of things?
[02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:45.260]   What's the role of military power in the world?
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:50.260]   And now with COVID, it's almost like,
[02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:57.260]   because of the many failures of the US government
[02:16:57.260 --> 02:17:02.260]   and many leaders in science and politics
[02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:07.300]   to respond effectively and quickly to COVID,
[02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:12.300]   we kind of forget that we fumbled this other thing too.
[02:17:12.300 --> 02:17:15.300]   And it's hard to know which is going to be more expensive.
[02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:19.700]   They seem to be symptoms of something,
[02:17:21.020 --> 02:17:26.020]   of a same kind of source problem of leadership,
[02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:31.740]   of bureaucracy, of the way information
[02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:34.500]   and intelligence flows throughout the US government,
[02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:35.660]   all those kinds of things.
[02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:39.340]   And that hopefully motivates young leaders to fix things.
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:40.180]   - Definitely.
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:41.140]   I mean, I think if there's one theme
[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:43.060]   that jumps out to me in thinking about this moment,
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:45.100]   I mean, if we recognize that we live
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:48.540]   in a kind of crisis of democracy in the United States
[02:17:48.540 --> 02:17:50.900]   and in other countries that have long been proud
[02:17:50.900 --> 02:17:51.860]   of their democratic traditions,
[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:54.260]   if we see them be under assault from certain quarters,
[02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:57.740]   I think military defeat is yet another addition
[02:17:57.740 --> 02:18:00.060]   to all the aspects of this that you mentioned.
[02:18:00.060 --> 02:18:04.060]   I mean, the fact that military defeat is a giant match
[02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:05.060]   that you're throwing on this fire,
[02:18:05.060 --> 02:18:07.820]   potentially if we think of its legacies
[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:09.140]   and other post-war environments,
[02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:12.740]   when the veteran angle is one,
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:15.540]   when you have people who feel betrayed.
[02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:17.900]   I mean, they have been fodder for the far right
[02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:18.740]   in other settings.
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:19.860]   Interwar Europe is very much
[02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:23.060]   about mobilizing disillusioned veterans
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:25.320]   in the name of right-wing fascist politics.
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:28.980]   If one thing's too at this moment
[02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:32.100]   of really increasing xenophobia,
[02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:33.900]   our immigration debate is now talking
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:36.460]   about whether or not Afghans should be permitted at all
[02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:39.060]   in the United States after 20 years.
[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:41.580]   And I think immediately the response in Europe,
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:43.340]   which I follow to some extent,
[02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:45.100]   focusing on Germany,
[02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:49.100]   because it was really ramping up deportations of Afghans
[02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:50.820]   leading up to this collapse.
[02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:52.100]   And now they have been,
[02:18:52.100 --> 02:18:57.100]   a lot of right-wing center-right politicians in Germany
[02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:01.220]   have been watching all this with an eye to,
[02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:02.500]   I think using it to their advantage
[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:06.380]   for a domestic German audience to say,
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:07.700]   in the context of recent elections,
[02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:09.820]   that we are the party who will defend you
[02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:11.460]   against these Afghans who are gonna be coming from this.
[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:13.420]   So, what I've tried to emphasize
[02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:15.220]   in talking to different groups about this moment
[02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:17.740]   is that it won't be confined to Afghanistan
[02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:18.580]   or even the region.
[02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:20.740]   I mean, obviously malnutrition, hunger,
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:23.180]   will send Afghans to neighboring states,
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:27.260]   but where the European right is resurgent,
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:28.700]   this has been a gift, right?
[02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:30.780]   To say that the Afghans are coming,
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:32.540]   they're brown-skinned, they're Muslim,
[02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:35.060]   they're uneducated, they're gonna want your women.
[02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:37.980]   And they will take the odd sexual assault case
[02:19:37.980 --> 02:19:41.540]   or the odd whatever dramatic act of violence
[02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:45.460]   that happens numerically in any population,
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:47.260]   and they'll magnify that to say that
[02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:51.820]   our far-right group is gonna save the nation.
[02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:54.740]   And sorry, the main point I wanted to speak of leadership
[02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:56.820]   was that I think the serial,
[02:19:56.820 --> 02:20:00.260]   well, there are many, many carnal sins, if you like,
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:02.660]   but if you go back to our analogy of all the exits,
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:04.820]   I mean, what blocked some of those exits
[02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:09.740]   was an absence of truth and transparency and the lying.
[02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:12.300]   And so, I mean, this is no secret anyone has followed this,
[02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:15.220]   but we've allowed,
[02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:17.540]   and you think of the general mistrust of government,
[02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:21.900]   mistrust of authority across the board,
[02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:24.100]   of professors, of economists, of--
[02:20:24.100 --> 02:20:26.820]   - Scientists. - Scientists, doctors, right?
[02:20:26.820 --> 02:20:27.820]   - Well, I actually think,
[02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:30.220]   that's the hopeful thing to me about the internet
[02:20:30.220 --> 02:20:34.180]   is the internet hates inauthenticity.
[02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:36.220]   They can smell bullshit much better,
[02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:38.340]   and I think that motivates young leaders
[02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:40.620]   to be transparent and authentic.
[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:42.460]   So like-- - I hope so.
[02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:45.300]   - The very problems we've been seeing,
[02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:49.220]   this kind of attitude of authority where,
[02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:53.260]   oh, the populace, they're too busy with their own lies,
[02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:56.140]   they're not smart enough to understand the full complexities
[02:20:56.140 --> 02:20:57.620]   of the things we're dealing with,
[02:20:57.620 --> 02:20:59.860]   so we're not going to even communicate to them
[02:20:59.860 --> 02:21:02.900]   the full complexities, we're just going to decide
[02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:05.340]   and then tell them what we decided
[02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:08.140]   and conceive some kind of narrative
[02:21:08.140 --> 02:21:12.300]   that makes it easy for them to consume this decision.
[02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:13.500]   - Right, right.
[02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:16.620]   - As opposed to that, I really believe,
[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:18.820]   I see there's a hunger for authenticity
[02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:21.780]   of when you're making decisions,
[02:21:21.780 --> 02:21:23.780]   when you're looking at the rest of the world
[02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:27.540]   and trying to decide, untangle this complexity,
[02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:30.340]   the internet, the public,
[02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:33.180]   the world wants to see you as a leader struggle
[02:21:33.180 --> 02:21:35.420]   with the tension of these ideas,
[02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:38.820]   to change your mind, to see,
[02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:41.260]   to recognize your own flaws in your own thinking
[02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:44.260]   from a month ago, all that, the full complexity of it,
[02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:47.620]   also acknowledge the uncertainty as with COVID,
[02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:51.780]   also with the wars, I think there's a hunger for that
[02:21:51.780 --> 02:21:53.340]   and I think that's just going to change
[02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:56.300]   the nature of leadership in the 21st century.
[02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:58.580]   - I hope so, I think all the things you've highlighted,
[02:21:58.580 --> 02:22:00.820]   I mean, accountability is part of that, right?
[02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:04.700]   I mean, we need honesty, openness,
[02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:06.660]   and then acknowledgement of mistakes,
[02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:08.860]   I mean, humility is the key to all learning, right?
[02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:10.820]   But also, I mean, you think just the headline
[02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:14.620]   from yesterday, the horrible drone strike,
[02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:18.140]   which was really the last kind of American military action
[02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:20.420]   on the day that the US was, I think,
[02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:22.660]   mostly departing from Kabul,
[02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:25.500]   wiped out an entire family, mostly children,
[02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:27.020]   the US acknowledged that, yes,
[02:22:27.020 --> 02:22:29.540]   this was not the ISIS bombing outfit
[02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:31.300]   that they thought it was,
[02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:33.580]   but yesterday they did a quick review
[02:22:34.580 --> 02:22:36.940]   and I'm not an expert on drone strikes in the aftermath,
[02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:38.740]   but as he was looking more closely,
[02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:41.860]   he said it was basically whole cloth taken
[02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:44.900]   from what the US government has been saying
[02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:46.700]   after all these strikes,
[02:22:46.700 --> 02:22:48.100]   you know, reproducing the same language
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:51.740]   and basically pointing to technical errors,
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:56.740]   but denying that there were any procedural mistakes
[02:22:56.740 --> 02:22:59.780]   or flaws or it was just kind of,
[02:22:59.780 --> 02:23:01.820]   they found little ways of acknowledging things
[02:23:01.820 --> 02:23:06.340]   that goes plan, but we follow the policies essentially
[02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:09.700]   and that's it, it's not a crime,
[02:23:09.700 --> 02:23:13.700]   it's a way of not even saying, you know, we screwed up
[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:15.620]   and it's kind of the legalese
[02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:19.220]   that suddenly makes a war crime, not a war crime,
[02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:22.460]   you know, and that is, I feel like,
[02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:24.660]   are feasible to take accountability.
[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:26.660]   - I think people are really sick of that
[02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:29.580]   in a way where the opposite is true,
[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:33.660]   which is they get excited for people who are not,
[02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:35.500]   for leaders who are not that,
[02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:37.660]   and so they're not going to punish you
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:40.260]   for saying I made a mistake.
[02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:44.740]   So I just had a conversation with Francis Collins,
[02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:46.220]   the director of NIH,
[02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:49.340]   and part of my criticism towards Anthony Fauci
[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:54.180]   has been that it's like such subtle,
[02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:58.940]   but such crucial communication of mistakes made.
[02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:00.540]   If you make a small mistake,
[02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:05.540]   it is so powerful to communicate, I think we messed up,
[02:24:05.540 --> 02:24:08.620]   we thought this was true and it wasn't.
[02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:11.220]   So the obvious thing there was with masks
[02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:14.620]   early in the pandemic, there's so much uncertainty,
[02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:17.020]   it's so understandable to make mistakes
[02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:21.140]   or to also be concerned about what kind of hysteria
[02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:23.420]   different statements you make lead to,
[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:25.780]   just being transparent about that and saying,
[02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:28.120]   we were not correct in saying the thing we said before,
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:33.120]   that's so powerful to communicate, to gain trust.
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:35.180]   And the opposite is true.
[02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:40.180]   When you do this legalese type of talk, it destroys trust.
[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:45.780]   And again, I really think the lessons of recent history
[02:24:45.780 --> 02:24:51.060]   teach us how to be a leader
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:53.580]   and teach young leaders how to be leaders.
[02:24:53.580 --> 02:24:56.180]   And so I have a lot of hope.
[02:24:56.180 --> 02:24:57.020]   - Yeah, good.
[02:24:57.020 --> 02:24:58.600]   Actually, thanks for the internet.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:00.160]   - Yeah, yeah, that's great.
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:02.240]   Oh, humility, I mean, we need humility,
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:03.600]   accountability, honesty.
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:07.720]   And yes, studying the past is an important way to do that.
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:09.720]   I mean, to learn from past mistakes
[02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:11.920]   and obviously there's always inspiration and courage
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:14.680]   and we can take some kind of assistance from that too,
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:19.100]   but also learning how not to do things, right?
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:23.120]   And then analogies are never like one-to-one.
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:24.240]   I mean, we talk about Vietnam.
[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:27.300]   I think many Vietnam veterans would say,
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:28.500]   this is like deja vu.
[02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:31.700]   I mean, the story, the visuals of the Kabul airport
[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:35.580]   and of the Saigon embassy were not the same,
[02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:38.220]   but close enough that people would juxtapose them.
[02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:39.620]   All of us right now, but I would just ask people
[02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:44.620]   that over-analogizing is also a kind of path down
[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:49.640]   making errors of judgment and comparison and then sameness.
[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:52.420]   But it's stretched, I mean, like 9/11 itself.
[02:25:52.420 --> 02:25:56.600]   I think the idea that people lack the imagination
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:58.120]   within our security apparatus
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:00.560]   to think this was even possible, right?
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:03.400]   And you think of the simplicity of having a $10 lock
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:06.400]   on a cockpit door, could have blunted all this.
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:10.040]   And again, I'm not saying either the time or hindsight
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:11.800]   that I am omniscient about all this,
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:15.120]   but I had just been living in Germany the year before
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:18.240]   and there was a plot there that this guy was hatching
[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:22.280]   from Germany to blow up the mausoleum of Ataturk in Ankara
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:23.600]   with an airplane.
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:27.500]   And so if you kind of dig, it wasn't unimaginable
[02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:29.760]   that you would use an airplane as a weapon.
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:31.600]   And the Bush administration kept saying,
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:33.760]   no one had ever heard of this, who would do this?
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:35.560]   I'm like, well, not a lot of people do this.
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:37.200]   And then at that very moment,
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:41.260]   my wife was teaching the Joseph Conrad novel, "Secret Agent,"
[02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:44.120]   which was about a conspiratorial organization
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:47.520]   that wanted to bomb, actually in retrospect,
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:49.000]   it was kind of suicide bombing
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.720]   'cause I think they tricked this guy into doing it,
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:53.520]   but they wanted to bomb the Greenwich Observatory
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:55.400]   for some obscure political purpose.
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:27:00.880]   So that's an instance in which the novel,
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:02.520]   to go back to our kind of humanities pitch,
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:06.480]   that I guess my point was that, as you mentioned,
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:09.960]   we need humanity, transparency, but also imagination.
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:14.160]   And I think part of expanding our imagination is by,
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:17.280]   I mean, obviously delving into your fields of engineering
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:19.840]   and the sciences and robotics and artificial intelligence
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:20.920]   and all that rich landscape.
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:24.760]   And then, but also we find this in film, poetry, literature,
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:28.560]   I mean, just the kind of stretching that we need to do
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:31.520]   to really educate ourselves more fully
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:34.920]   across the spectrum of everything humans need
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:37.720]   to reimagine security.
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:38.720]   So much of what we talked about today,
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:42.720]   I mean, so much of our security is affected
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:45.360]   by others' perception of their insecurity, right?
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:49.680]   Which unleashes a whole web of emotions.
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:53.520]   - Can you tell me about the Afghan people,
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:57.000]   what they love, what they fear,
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.080]   what they dream of for themselves and for their nation?
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:02.880]   Is there something to say, to speak to,
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:07.320]   to the spirit of the people that may humanize them
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:10.760]   and maybe speak to the concerns and the hopes they have?
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:13.960]   - Yeah, I think I, as an outsider,
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:16.320]   I hesitate to make any grand statement,
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:17.920]   but I would say, listen, I mean,
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.560]   there are a number of documentary films
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:23.440]   that are incredibly rich,
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:26.200]   that will offer your listeners and viewers a snapshot.
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:29.480]   So there is "Afghan Star,"
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:32.480]   which really brings you into the homes of a set of people
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:34.280]   who, they want stardom,
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:36.680]   they're artists, they want to express themselves.
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:39.920]   Some wanna push political boundaries, cultural boundaries.
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:42.640]   There's a woman who gets into hot water for dancing.
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:46.440]   But you realize that, I mean, people,
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:48.000]   I mean, they love art, they love music,
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.680]   they love poetry, they love expression.
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:52.800]   You know, people want to care for their children,
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:54.240]   they want safety of their families,
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:57.400]   they want to enjoy what everyone enjoys, you know?
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:00.600]   I think it's a very humanizing portrait.
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:02.800]   There's another great documentary film called
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:06.680]   "Love Crimes of Kabul,"
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:10.080]   which is a great snapshot of the post-2000 world
[02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:11.560]   that the Americans shaped a lot of ways.
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:13.640]   And it's about a women's prison.
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:15.560]   And it's incredibly revealing
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:19.880]   'cause it's about young girls and what they want.
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:22.280]   Well, not just young, but young, teenage,
[02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:23.440]   and then some middle-aged people
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:26.240]   who are accused of moral crimes,
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:29.960]   ranging from homicide, which one woman admits to,
[02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:33.760]   to having sexual relations outside of marriage.
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:35.760]   And so it shows, in a way,
[02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:38.680]   continuity with the previous Taliban regime
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:41.120]   in that women are imprisoned for things
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:42.360]   that you wouldn't be in prison for elsewhere,
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:46.920]   and that Islamo-claw operates as the kind of judicial logic
[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:50.240]   for these punishments.
[02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:52.760]   But in letting these women kind of speak for themselves,
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:53.600]   I mean, it's fascinating.
[02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:55.120]   I mean, I don't want to give too much away,
[02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:58.840]   but women make very interesting choices in this film
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:00.360]   that land them in this predicament.
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:04.160]   So they don't all profess innocence.
[02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:05.160]   Some are like, "I'm guilty,"
[02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:07.040]   but they're guilty for reasons.
[02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:08.600]   In one case, one woman is guilty.
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:11.240]   She's in prison because it's a way to exert pressure
[02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:13.160]   on her fiance to finally marry her.
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:18.560]   So you get ethnicity, you get kind of Romeo and Juliet things
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:20.640]   where their families don't like each other necessarily,
[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:22.040]   but they find each other.
[02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:26.340]   You have questions of love, money, clothing, furniture.
[02:30:26.340 --> 02:30:28.600]   It's beautiful.
[02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:31.000]   I mean, the parts with it, I remember showing it in class.
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.720]   There was a wonderful Afghan student who was,
[02:30:33.720 --> 02:30:35.960]   I think, a Fulbright at the ed school at Stanford,
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:36.880]   and she's a genius.
[02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:37.720]   She's amazing.
[02:30:37.720 --> 02:30:40.600]   It was awkward for her because,
[02:30:40.600 --> 02:30:42.320]   talking about young women having sex and stuff,
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:46.840]   and it wasn't the snapshot of Afghanistan that she wanted.
[02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:47.760]   And obviously, there's so much more.
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:50.440]   They're great writers and musicians.
[02:30:50.440 --> 02:30:52.280]   And I mean, music is a huge thing.
[02:30:52.280 --> 02:30:54.440]   I mean, poetry, all those things are great.
[02:30:54.440 --> 02:30:57.560]   So she found it, I hear you.
[02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:59.120]   I mean, it's kind of a taboo subject,
[02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:02.280]   but I thought the American students seeing it
[02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:04.800]   really identified with these women
[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:05.740]   because they're just so real.
[02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:08.600]   And so young people trying to find,
[02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:10.840]   I mean, relationships that are universal
[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:14.880]   in circumstances that are very difficult.
[02:31:14.880 --> 02:31:16.720]   Love, love is universal.
[02:31:16.720 --> 02:31:17.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:18.980]   So it's, I mean, we do have resources to humanize.
[02:31:18.980 --> 02:31:21.840]   I mean, some of your people will know Khaled Huseini.
[02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:23.840]   You know, he's an Afghan-American.
[02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:26.120]   He's done his stuff, but there are a number
[02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:30.480]   of novelists and short story writers who do cool things.
[02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:33.360]   I think that another tragic aspect of this moment
[02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:35.160]   is that those people have now pretty much
[02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:36.240]   had to leave the country.
[02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:40.000]   So there's a visual artist I would highlight for you
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:45.000]   named Khadam Ali, who's a Hazara based in Australia.
[02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:49.200]   He does extraordinary work in blending
[02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:51.680]   a tradition of Persian miniatures
[02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:53.920]   with contemporary political commentary.
[02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:57.080]   His work is between Australia and Afghanistan,
[02:31:57.080 --> 02:31:58.360]   but he also, he had to flee.
[02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:00.240]   I mean, he was doing some work in Kabul,
[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:05.240]   but it's an extraordinary kind of visual language
[02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:06.960]   that he's adapted that has been shown
[02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:07.800]   all over the planet now.
[02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:09.360]   He's got some of his work is in New York galleries,
[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:10.200]   is in Europe.
[02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:12.200]   He's been shown in Australia,
[02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:15.640]   but he talks about migration in a way that puts Afghans
[02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:18.760]   and Hazaras at the center, but it's totally universal
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:23.760]   about our modern crisis of all the millions of people
[02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:25.840]   who are displaced across our planet.
[02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:29.520]   And he attempts to kind of speak for some size of them
[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:32.320]   in a way that like, I think everyone can get.
[02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:33.760]   I mean, the visual imagery experts will know
[02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:36.960]   that it's from like the Shahnameh,
[02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:39.960]   like an ancient Persian epic that Iranians were attached to,
[02:32:39.960 --> 02:32:41.000]   that Afghans are attached to,
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:44.240]   that people can quote at length.
[02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:45.640]   That has mythical figures of good and evil
[02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:47.960]   that kids grew up embodying.
[02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:50.960]   They're named the names of the characters that are,
[02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:53.080]   it's called the Book of Kings.
[02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:54.520]   The heroes and villains are the staple
[02:32:54.520 --> 02:32:56.940]   of conversation and poetry.
[02:32:56.940 --> 02:33:01.040]   And like Russians, I mean, the kind of,
[02:33:01.040 --> 02:33:03.720]   the resort to literary references and speak
[02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:05.920]   is something that Americans don't do,
[02:33:05.920 --> 02:33:08.000]   most West European countries don't do,
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000]   but the fact that everyone's gotta know this character,
[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.640]   everyone knows this reference, the wordplay,
[02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:16.200]   the linguistic finesse in multiple languages
[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:20.600]   is a major value of Afghan storytelling.
[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:25.320]   As an outsider, I'm scratching at the surface of the surface.
[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:26.160]   - Yeah, but there's a depth to it.
[02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:28.040]   It's just like, it is fascinating.
[02:33:28.040 --> 02:33:29.080]   - With the layers, yeah.
[02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:30.880]   - With the layers of Russian language
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:33.400]   that's the culture. - Exactly.
[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:37.520]   - I've been struggling, and this is kind of the journey
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:43.220]   embarking on to convey to an American audience
[02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:48.220]   what is lost in translation between Russian and English.
[02:33:48.220 --> 02:33:51.560]   It's very challenging, and some of the great translators
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:55.240]   of Dostoevsky, of Tolstoy, of Russian literature
[02:33:55.240 --> 02:33:56.840]   struggle with this deeply.
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:02.000]   It's an art form just to convey that.
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:03.760]   It's amazing to hear that Afghanistan,
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:06.720]   with a full mix of cultures that are there,
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:11.080]   have the same kind of wit and humor and depth of intellect.
[02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:13.120]   - I mean, the humor thing is,
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:15.320]   so much of our visual imagery is about this sad place
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:18.560]   in Daur or whatever, but the, I mean, socially, again,
[02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:19.800]   I'm gonna engage in some stereotypes
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:21.800]   about generalization stuff, but just the,
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:25.680]   you know, the Afghan friends that I've come to be close
[02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:28.400]   with and really love, I mean, the humor,
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:31.400]   there's so much there, I have common stuff of like,
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:33.400]   when I go to Ireland, it's one of my favorite places,
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:36.280]   and just like the, I feel a sense of pressure,
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:38.080]   like the humor all around me all the time,
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:41.920]   and I feel like there's something between Ireland and Russia
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:43.760]   with the humor stuff, where it's like,
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:46.240]   you've gotta be on your game if you wanna be, you know,
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:49.000]   so it's, it's not, you know what I mean?
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:52.920]   - The intensity of conversation in terms of,
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:54.280]   yeah, you have to be on your game
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:56.000]   in terms of wit and so on.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.160]   I mean, you have to, there's certain people
[02:34:58.160 --> 02:34:59.680]   I have, like, when I talk on this podcast,
[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:01.680]   they're like that, certain people
[02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:03.400]   from the Jewish tradition have that,
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:06.920]   like where the wit is just like, okay, I have to,
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:09.360]   oh yeah, I really have to pay attention,
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:12.400]   it's a game, it's like, you know what it feels like?
[02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:14.680]   It feels like speed chess or something like that,
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:17.440]   and you really have to focus and play,
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:19.520]   and at the same time, there's body language,
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:22.280]   and then there's a melancholy nature to it,
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:23.520]   at least on the Russian side,
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:25.800]   and the whole thing is just a beautiful mess.
[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:27.080]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a funny TikTok video
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:30.320]   that went around that I got from some Afghan acquaintances
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:33.120]   that was, he's an Irish comedian,
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:37.160]   kind of highlighting Irish and German
[02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:39.760]   national stereotypes around hospitality,
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:41.920]   and this Afghan woman said, "I didn't know
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:45.000]   "that the Irish were just white Afghans,"
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:48.360]   because the whole hospitality, politics of refusal,
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:51.560]   you don't take something that's offered to you
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:52.880]   the first time, you don't, I mean,
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:57.080]   it's the culture of receiving a guest,
[02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:01.480]   that's, Americans aren't, I mean, that's not always,
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:03.520]   I mean, the regional culture is, that's a thing,
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:05.200]   there's whatever, but it's, I mean,
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:08.560]   the kind of generosity and the kind of,
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:11.480]   that's real, I mean, and that's a cool thing,
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:13.160]   and that's amazing, that's, you know,
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:14.840]   the food, I mean, going off just the superficial things,
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:19.080]   but all of that, the warmth of hospitality
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:23.600]   and of wit and humanity, I mean, it's,
[02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:25.840]   that's what we don't see viewing the place
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:27.720]   just through war and geopolitics
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:29.160]   and the moving pieces of the map and stuff,
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:33.560]   and that's hard to see when there are gaps in language
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:35.840]   and religious tradition and all that stuff,
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:38.440]   and then, you know, being open to the fact
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:41.080]   that people do things differently, you know,
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:43.520]   and it's, and the gender dimension there is important,
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:46.920]   right, that they're kind of, you know,
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:48.800]   arguably each culture has a kind of gender dynamic
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:50.360]   that's different, and so I think it's helpful
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:53.120]   to have humility in thinking that some Afghans
[02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:55.720]   will do some things differently, you know,
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:57.720]   but then you'll also have Afghans who say,
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:36:59.840]   every woman should be educated,
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:01.280]   every woman should work, and so on and so on,
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:03.480]   so there's no single way of, yeah, yeah.
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:05.800]   - And there is a gender dynamic in Russia, too,
[02:37:05.800 --> 02:37:07.880]   that we need to be respectful of that, like--
[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:10.080]   - And that's not always what it looks like at first.
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:11.360]   - Yeah, exactly, there's layers.
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:13.160]   - Like where power is, I mean, that's definitely,
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:14.320]   I don't know, yeah.
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:16.040]   - Yeah, that's a whole 'nother conversation
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.240]   of where the power is.
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:18.240]   - Yeah.
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:20.680]   - Rumi, the 13th century Persian poet
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:24.040]   who was born on a land that is now Afghanistan,
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:26.960]   is there something in his words that speaks to you
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:29.480]   about the spirit of the Afghan people?
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:33.040]   - I mean, everyone owns Rumi, I guess that's,
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:34.040]   I mean, that's gonna get me in trouble
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:36.040]   with certain Afghan fans of Rumi
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:39.520]   who wanna see him as an Afghan, I would say.
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:42.000]   - Are they proud of Rumi?
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:42.840]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:44.680]   - Do they see him as an Afghan, do they--
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:46.160]   - Yeah, I mean, again, it depends.
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:49.880]   I mean, some people will be militant and say,
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:52.240]   you know, the Iranians can have him, he's ours.
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:55.960]   But they also say, you know, he's,
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:58.040]   I mean, you can say, again, he's like Rorschach blot.
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:02.320]   I mean, he's a Sufi, he's a Muslim, he's a Central Asian,
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:05.980]   he's Iranian, he's Afghan, he's a Turk.
[02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:06.820]   I'm trying to think of the analogy,
[02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:08.960]   but he's something special to everyone.
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:11.160]   So I guess I would not walk into that conversation
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:12.480]   and claim that he's one or another,
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:13.320]   but it's a cool thing.
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:15.880]   It's the, but I'm glad you brought that up
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:20.720]   'cause that's a good way of seeing something that Afghans,
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:22.280]   I mean, we live in our country, Afghanistan,
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:24.760]   and say, okay, Rumi's everyone, you know,
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:26.440]   Madonna helped make him famous in the United States,
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:27.900]   you know, for better, for worse.
[02:38:27.900 --> 02:38:29.200]   They used to sell stuff at Starbucks
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:32.040]   and that's all complicated and embarrassing.
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:35.200]   And his translations are very much disputed
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:36.480]   where you have people be like,
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:38.880]   there's some awful Rumi translations and there are,
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:40.920]   there are also a lot of, speaking of the internet,
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:42.960]   there are lots of fake Rumi quotes.
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:43.800]   - Yes.
[02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:46.120]   - You know, like Rumi said, always be your best.
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:47.840]   Like, Rumi didn't say that.
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:48.680]   You know, that was, you know,
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:49.520]   I mean, that's kind of silly stuff,
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:52.160]   but then the cool thing is like the,
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:56.400]   I mean, I think you can read Rumi as a religious thinker,
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:59.040]   but you can also, you know, read Rumi as a,
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:01.360]   you know, in an Islamic sense,
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:03.080]   but you can also read him as a kind of spiritualist,
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:05.200]   right, as someone who, or an ethicist or moralist.
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:07.000]   And so I think that's,
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:12.000]   I like the lens of Rumi as a gateway to Afghan ecumenicism
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:14.080]   and cosmopolitanism.
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:15.360]   You know, the theme I keep emphasizing
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:19.200]   of meeting actual Afghans who were actually,
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:22.400]   you know, fluent in Russian, fluent in German,
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:24.000]   fluent in Turkish.
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.640]   They know Dari, they know Pashto.
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:29.600]   They've gone to university or sometimes they haven't.
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:31.400]   And yet, I mean, they're,
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:35.320]   I like the category of the popular intellectual.
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:37.200]   You know, the intellectual who isn't,
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:38.960]   isn't formally educated necessarily.
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:40.480]   Although of course that's represented too,
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:42.080]   especially increasingly now with this generation
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:43.560]   of going to university all over the world,
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:45.360]   you know, Stanford, MIT, everywhere.
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:48.360]   Afghans are well represented there.
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:51.440]   But just being, I don't have any kind of worldly knowledge
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:54.200]   that is not limited to a province,
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:57.000]   to a village, to a hamlet, but sometimes it is,
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.680]   but sometimes it's not because of,
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:04.560]   again, not because of some fairytale story of curiosity,
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:07.720]   wandering the globe out of, you know,
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:11.040]   some sense of privilege, but out of necessity,
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:12.560]   out of survival, of having to adapt.
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:15.400]   And it's really extraordinary that,
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:16.920]   I mean, also we think about like professions,
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:20.960]   like, you know, ask an Afghan, you know,
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:22.800]   what does he or she do for a living?
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:23.960]   And what have they done in the past?
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:25.520]   I mean, the answer is one gets,
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:30.520]   shoe salesman, tax cop drivers, surgeons, all in one guy.
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:32.200]   - Yeah.
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:34.000]   - I mean, that's not just Afghan,
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.800]   but that's, you know, that's very common.
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:37.880]   - But it's also Russia is the same.
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:38.720]   - That's right.
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:40.440]   - I think it's whenever there's complexities
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:43.600]   to the economic system and the short-term
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:46.880]   and the long-term history of how the country develops.
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:50.000]   It's basically the people figuring out their way
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:54.200]   around a mess of a country politically,
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:59.200]   but a beautiful flourishing culture and humanity.
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:01.480]   And that creates super interesting people.
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:02.640]   - Yeah.
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:05.680]   - So we can often see, okay, there's Taliban, there's war,
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:09.620]   there's economic malfunction,
[02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:11.960]   there's harboring of terrorists, there's opium trade,
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:12.800]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:16.760]   But there's humans there with deep intellectual lies.
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:21.200]   And like, I love the movie "Love Crimes"
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:25.760]   and the same kind of hopes, fears, and desire to love
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:27.720]   the old Romeo and Juliet story.
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:30.000]   And I think Rumi to me represents that.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:36.480]   The wit, the intelligence, but also the just eloquent
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:40.860]   and just beautiful representation of humanity, of love.
[02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:44.700]   Some of the best quotes about love are from him.
[02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:48.100]   Half of them fake, half of them real.
[02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:49.380]   - The best ones are real.
[02:41:49.380 --> 02:41:50.860]   - The best ones are real.
[02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:52.020]   The best ones are real.
[02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:53.860]   Robert, this was an incredible conversation.
[02:41:53.860 --> 02:41:54.700]   - Oh, thank you for having me.
[02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:59.380]   - Thank you for the tour of Afghanistan
[02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:04.380]   and making me, making us realize that there's much more
[02:42:04.900 --> 02:42:09.000]   to this country than what we may think.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:13.480]   It's a beautiful country and it's full of beautiful people.
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:15.000]   - You made me think about a lot of new things too,
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.440]   so it was definitely great on my end too.
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:19.280]   So thank you so much.
[02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:20.720]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:21.960]   with Robert Cruz.

[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:29.800]   from Winston Churchill.
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:34.540]   History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it.
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:38.520]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
