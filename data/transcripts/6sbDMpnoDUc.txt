[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Let us pray.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, we come to Thee, and we come to worship and to offer our praise and our thanksgiving.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   We do thank Thee, O Lord, that Thou hast ever created within us this desire to come before Thee and to seek Thy face.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   We thank Thee for the realization we have of Thy goodness to us and all Thy loving kindness.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   And yet, O Lord, as we contemplate Thy manifold goodness and kindness toward us, we feel that our praise and our acknowledgement of it is ever so small.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   We would therefore ask Thee to tune our hearts to sing Thy praise aright.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And, O Lord, we pray that Thou wouldst so grant us Thy Spirit that we shall likewise praise Thee in our lives as well as with our lips.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   We do indeed desire with the whole of our being to tell forth Thy praise.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me. Bless His holy name.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   That is the desire of our hearts.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   And so we ask Thee once more as we come to consider together how those of us especially who are called to preach and to proclaim Thy word
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   can show forth Thy glory as we expound the truth of the Scriptures.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   We ask that Thou wouldst give us further enlightenment and further understanding
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   so that we may perform this great and wonderful task always in a manner that shall be well-pleasing in Thy holy sight.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So we leave ourselves in Thy hands once more and pray that Thou wouldst bless us to this end.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Pardon and forgive us for all the imperfection of our service and all our failure and all our sin in Thy most holy sight.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We have nothing to plead save the blood and the merit of Thy dear Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Well, you will remember, I take it, that I announced last time that this would be my last lecture
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   so that we are left with two sessions then for questions and for discussion.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I hope this has proved to be satisfactory for you.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   But as you will have observed, I have certain ideas with regard to this whole question of preaching
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   and I felt I should like to state my case and put my position first before we came to questions and to discussion.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Very well. We come to the last and I keep and have reserved to the last
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   what is after all the greatest essential of all in connection with preaching.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And that is unction, the unction and the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It may seem odd to some of you that I keep the most important thing of all to the end.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   You may ask why didn't I start with it.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Well, the reason for that is this, that I believe we are to do or to attempt to do all that I have been trying to say first
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and then the unction comes upon this.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I have already indicated in making certain points
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   that there is a danger for some men to rely upon the unction only
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   instead of doing all they can by way of preparation and so on first.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I think that is the right way to look upon the unction of the Spirit.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It is that which comes upon the preparation.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   If I may use an illustration, I hope you are clear that this is an illustration
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and that I am not spiritualizing something.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   The illustration is what happened on Mount Carmel, you remember, with Elijah.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He built the altar, he cut the wood and put it in pieces.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   He took the bullock and cut him in pieces and put it on the wood.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And then he prayed for the fire to descend and the fire came.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Many other examples are the same thing.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I was giving one on a Thursday night in the case of the erection of the tabernacle in the wilderness.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Moses first did everything that God had told him to do
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and it was only after Moses had done all that
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   that the glory of the Lord came down upon the tabernacle.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So you see, this is the reason for reserving this
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   which is the most important thing of all, to the end.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   God helps those who help themselves, is fairly true in this connection as it is in other connections.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So we mustn't put these things as opposites.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I'm delaying this because I think this is a most important point.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   We all tend to be people of extremes.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Some rely only on their own preparation and look for nothing more
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   while others, as I say, tend to despise preparation
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   and trust to the anointing and the inspiration of the Spirit.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Well, it isn't either/or here, it's birth and.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   These two things must go together.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Now, what do I mean by this anointing and this anointing?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I believe the best way to approach this is to show you from the Scriptures, first of all, what I mean by this.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But perhaps before I do even that, it would be good for me to ask a question.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Those of you who have preached, do you look for this unction and anointing?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Has this been of concern to you?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's a very good test because, as I'm suggesting, it is the most important thing of all.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Well, what is this? Well, this is a special pouring of the Spirit upon the preacher.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   It's an access of power.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It is something that God gives through the Spirit to enable one to do this work
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   in a manner that lifts it up beyond the efforts and endeavors of men
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   to a position in which the preacher is being used by the Spirit
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   and becomes the channel whom the Spirit uses.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Now, I think that this is something that comes out very clearly in the Scriptures.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I've got to try and give you the Scriptural aspect of this and the historical
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   and make some comments as best I can this afternoon.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Now, the first, I think, that one would start with would be, therefore, John the Baptist
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   because he is the forerunner, and this is what we are told about him.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   The message that was given to his father Zacharias was this.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   You find it in Luke 1, verses 15 and following.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   "For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   of the wisdom of the just," and so on.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Now, this, you see, is an excellent summary
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   of what was the position of the prophets of the Old Testament.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   You remember how these men were aware of a kind of a flirtus which came upon them.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   The Spirit took hold of them, and they were given a message
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   and given power to deliver it.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It is the great characteristic of the prophets, and John is the last of the prophets.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And we are told about him in this way, that he shall be endued
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   in this very special way with the Holy Ghost and the power of the Holy Ghost to do his work.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And when you read the accounts of his ministry, this is obvious.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   "For he spoke in such a manner that people came under terrible conviction."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   The preaching of John the Baptist could convict even Pharisees,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and that's the test of the ministry.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   But there it is, you see, even in the case of the forerunner himself.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But John, you remember, ends his ministry in a sense by saying
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   that this is all preparatory.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   "I am not the Christ," he says, "that cometh one mightier than I,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   the lecher to whose shoes I am unworthy to unloose.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I indeed baptize you with water; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire."
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Now, here is something further.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And what is so interesting is that we get this
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   even with regard to our Lord himself.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   This is a point I think that's very often missed.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   The way in which the Holy Ghost descended upon our Lord
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   as he was coming up out of the Jordan when John had baptized him.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   The Spirit came upon him in the form of a dove.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And afterwards, this is how he puts it.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   You remember when he went into the synagogue in his hometown of Nazareth,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Luke 4, 18, and so on.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor."
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And you remember the rest of the quotation.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   But what I'm concerned about now is this.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   That he says that what happened to him there at Jordan was
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   that he was anointed by the Spirit
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   to preach this gospel of salvation,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Now, this is a very striking thing.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It throws great light, of course, upon the real meaning of the Incarnation.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   But it's clear that even our Lord himself, the Son of God,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   could not have exercised his ministry
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   unless he had received this special, peculiar anointing
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   of the Holy Spirit to perform his task.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   It is true even of him.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Then I'm picking out what I regard as the most important passages
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   dealing with this matter.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   You then go on, of course, to the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And you get it in Acts 1, 8.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   "But ye shall receive power
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And ye shall be witnesses unto me,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   and the uttermost parts of the earth."
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Now, it's good to link that up always with the last chapter
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Where you remember our Lord is speaking to those
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   assembled disciples in the upper room.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   He says he's sending them out.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   "Thus it is written, and thus it behold,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   among all nations beginning at Jerusalem.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And you are witnesses of these things.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   And behold, I send the promise of the Father upon you.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And so he in the city of Jerusalem
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   until ye be endued with power from on high."
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   That, you see, leads on to Acts 1, 8.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And, of course, to the fulfillment of all this in Acts 2.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Now, the significance of this as I see it is this.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   That here were men whom you would have thought
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   were in a perfect position and condition already
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   to act as preachers.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   They'd been with our Lord for three years.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   They'd heard all his discourses, his instruction.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   They'd seen all his miracles.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   They'd had the benefit of being with him, looking into his face.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   This personal conversation and communion with him.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   They'd been witnesses of the crucifixion,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   some three of them, even of the transfiguration.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   But they'd witnessed the crucifixion and the burial.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   They were living witnesses of the physical resurrection.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   You would have thought these men
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   were now in a perfect position to go out and preach.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   But according to our Lord's teaching, they were not.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   They seem to have all the knowledge.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   But the knowledge isn't sufficient.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   He wants something on top of the knowledge.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   You need the knowledge. You can't be a witness without it.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   But you need the power and the action and the demonstration
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   on top of this.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Now, if this was necessary for these men,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   how much more is it necessary for all others
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   who try to preach about these things?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   To me, this is a very striking and a very powerful argument.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And so we read of the Spirit coming upon
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   these assembled men on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   And at once you see the difference that it made to them.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   The Peter, who in a craven spirit had denied his Lord
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   in order to save his own life,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   is now filled with boldness and with great assurance.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   He's able to expound the Scriptures
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   and speaks with mighty effect.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   So the 3,000 people were converted under his preaching.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   This is the inauguration, as it were,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   of the Christian Church as we know her
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   in this dispensation of the Spirit.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And there we are given this graphic picture of it.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   But I want to call attention to something else.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Again, I feel a point that we often tend to miss.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   This accession of power, or if you prefer it,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   this effusion of power upon Christian preachers
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   is not something once and for all.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   It is something that is repeated and repeated many, many times.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Now let me give you some examples of this.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   There we've seen these apostles filled with this power.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And the whole object of the baptism of the Spirit
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   is to enable men to witness with power.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I hope we're all clear about this.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I mustn't go into this too much in detail.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   It's got nothing to do with sanctification.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   The baptism of the Spirit is a baptism of power,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   or a baptism of fire.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Now the old preachers used to make a great deal of this.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   They used to ask about a man,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   "Has he received his baptism of fire?"
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   That was the great question.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   So it's not sanctification.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   This is power, power to witness.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Now, very well, they've had this on the day of Pentecost,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   and Peter has witnessed.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   In Acts 3 we are told, "He and John again witnessed
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   after the healing of that impotent man,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   and did so in preaching in the temple."
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   But look again at Acts 4, 8.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Here are Peter and John on trial before the Sanhedrin.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And the charges are brought against them.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   "And when God had set them in the midst, they asked,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   'By what power or by what name have ye done this?'"
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And notice what it goes on to say,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   "Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   said unto them, 'Ye rulers of the people,'" and so on.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Now how do you interpret that?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Why does it say, "Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost"?
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   You might say, "But wasn't he filled with the Holy Ghost
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   on the day of Pentecost, as the other men were?"
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Well, what's the point of repeating it here then?
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Well, there's only one adequate explanation of this.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   There's no purpose in saying this, unless it means this,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   that he received a fresh accession of power.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   He was in a critical position.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Here he was on trial, he and John,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   and he needed some new, fresh power, and it's given him.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   So the expression is used, "Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost."
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   This was another filling for this special task.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   And then you've got another one in that same chapter.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Chapter 4, Acts 31, "When they were all praying now,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   in fear and trembling of the authorities
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   who were trying to exterminate the church.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And when they had prayed, the place was shaken
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   where they were assembled together,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost."
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   The same people again.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   You see, they've been filled on the day of Pentecost.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   These two, Peter and John, filled again,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   but here the company is now filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   So it's obvious that this is something
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   that can be repeated many times.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Then when you go to Acts 6, which we refer to
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   at the very beginning of these lectures,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   a very important chapter, where you have the deacons appointed.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   And you notice the qualifications that are stressed
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   in verses 3 and 5.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   "Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   seven men of honest report,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom."
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   This isn't true of everybody,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   but it's true of some
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   whom we may appoint over this business.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And then in verse 5, "And the saying pleased
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost."
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   But you say, "Weren't they all filled with the Holy Ghost?"
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Not in this sense.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   There's something special here.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   There's something peculiar.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   There's something additional.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   And they're told to look out for this.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   You see, it's exactly the same point.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And then another one in Acts 7, 55.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Stephen, just before he was stoned to death.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   It's a wonderful thing, this.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Verse 54, "When they heard these things,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   these were his accusers, the members of the Zenedrine,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   they were cut to the heart,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   But he, being full of the Holy Ghost,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   looked up steadfastly into heaven
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   and saw the glory of God and Jesus
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   standing on the right hand of God."
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   This is, again, obviously a special imbuement.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Again, a man in a great crisis.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And the Spirit comes upon him
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   in an exceptional manner again,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   a new way again,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   and enables him to face the crisis.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   And I'll just give you one other,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   because this is about the Apostle Paul,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   who came later into these things.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Acts 13, 9.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   The Apostle Paul, you remember,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   with Barnabas, had arrived
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   at this country
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   where there was a deputy
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   of the name of Sergius Paulus.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And this man desired to hear the word of God,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   but Elemus, the sorcerer,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   withstood them,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Then, verse 9,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   "Then Saul, who is also called Paul,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   filled with the Holy Ghost,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   set his eyes on him."
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Now, when it says they're filled with the Holy Ghost,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   it is not referring back to the fact
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   that he was filled with the Holy Ghost
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   as the result of his meeting with Ananias before.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   You see, it's ridiculous to repeat this
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   if it's happened once and for all.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   This is, again, a special imbuement of power,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   a special crisis, a special occasion.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And they were given this special power
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   for this special occasion.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I would go further and suggest this,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   that this always happened to these apostles
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   whenever they worked a miracle
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   or whenever they had some very special situation
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   to deal with,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   which I think is a very important point in this way.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   There's a great difference
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   between the miracles worked by the apostles
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   and the miracles, it is claimed,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   that certain men perform today.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And the big difference is this.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   You never find the apostles announcing
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   that they're going to have a healing service
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   in a few days' time.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Why not? Because they never knew
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   when it was going to happen.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   I suggest to you that what happened invariably was this.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   There was Paul dealing with those men.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   You'll find the same thing with the men at Lystra
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   in the next chapter.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   He was contained that he was suddenly given a commission.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   He knew nothing about this until he was given the commission
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   and the power.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And he did it.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   So the first difference is between
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   so-called miracle workers and the apostles
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   that the apostles could never predict it
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   or foretell it or announce it.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   But there's a second difference also.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   The apostles, you notice in the book of Acts, never failed.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   It wasn't an experiment.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   They were not trying an experiment.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   They knew they were given a commission
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   so they could speak with authority.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   And they did.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And there was no failure.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   There can be no failure when this is the position.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Well, now, then, there is the general picture
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   in the book of Acts of the apostles.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   But come to something more direct and specific
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   even than all this.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   The great statement, of course, of the apostle Paul
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   in 1 Corinthians 2,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   which is crucial in this whole matter
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   where he describes his own preaching at Corinth.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   "And I was with you in weakness and in fear
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and in much trembling.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And my speech and my preaching
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   was not with enticing words of men's wisdom
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   but in demonstration of the spirit and of power
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   but in the power of God."
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   That's absolutely crucial.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Here, as a man was greatly gifted,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   had great natural powers,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   he deliberately doesn't use them
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   in that carnal sense.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   He determines to start
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   not to know anything among themselves
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And then he deliberately eschews
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   the manner of the Greek rhetoricians
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   and the manner of the rabbins
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   with which he was so accustomed and so on.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   As he says later,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   he became a fool for Christ's sake
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   in order that it might be clear
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   that the power was not his but God's
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   and that their whole position
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   should not be based upon the wisdom of men
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   but upon the power of God.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Now, coming from Paul of everybody,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   this, I think, is a most striking manner.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And then he reminds the Corinthians
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   of the same thing
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   in the fourth chapter of the 20th verse.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   They were doing a good deal of talking in Corinth
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   and a good deal of criticizing of the apostle Paul
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   as people will still do, of course.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   And now he challenges them.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   He says, "Now some are puffed up
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   as though I would not come to you
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   but I will come to you."
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   And he says, "I will come to you
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   but I will come to you shortly if the Lord will
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   and will know not the speech of them
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   which are puffed up but the power.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   For the kingdom of God is not in word
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   but in power."
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   And if ever we needed to be reminded of a text,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   it's that one.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   We can produce the words, can't we?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   But is there much evidence of power in our preaching?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   The kingdom of God is not in word
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   but in power.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   That is the test.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And it is still the test
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   of true preaching.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   So we can go on.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   He's really saying the same thing
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   in 2 Corinthians 4, 7
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   where having talked about his own ministry
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   that as we have received mercy
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   we faint not but have renounced
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   the hidden things of dishonesty
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   not walking in craftiness
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   nor handling the word of God deceitfully
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   but by manifestation of the truth
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   and mending ourselves to every man's conscience
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   in the sight of God.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And then he goes on and then he comes to this.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Makes this great statement
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   "God who commended the light to shine out of darkness
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   has shined in our hearts
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   There's your content.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   But we have this treasure in earthen vessels
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   that the excellency of the power
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   might be of God
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   and not of us.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   And he says the same thing.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And how anxious he is always
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   to emphasize this.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   You get it again in 2 Corinthians 10, 4
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   but mighty through God
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   to the pulling down of strongholds
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   casting down imaginations
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   and every high thing that exalted itself"
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   and so on.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   It's the same thing, not carnal
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   mighty through God.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   It's spiritual power.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   2 Corinthians 12
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Where you remember he'd been lifted up
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   into the third heavens
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and had seen and heard things that can't be repeated
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and then the thorn in the flesh
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   and praying three times
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   but the thorn isn't removed.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   But he's all right about this
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   because you see he ends by putting it like this
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   He said "My grace is sufficient for thee
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   for my strength is made perfect in weakness
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   that the power of Christ may rest upon me
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   when I am weak
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   then am I strong"
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   This is his position always.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And then another statement of this
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   which always moves me tremendously
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   whenever I read it
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   is at the end of Colossians chapter 1
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   "Whom we preach
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   whereunto I also labor
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   striving according to his working
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   which worketh in me mightily"
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   That's always his testimony.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   He was doing his utmost
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   but what he's aware of
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   is his working
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   which worketh in me mightily.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   This is what is meant by this unction.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   A still more precise definition even than that
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   is in 1 Thessalonians 1 5
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   "For our gospel came not unto you in word only
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   but also in power
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   and in the Holy Ghost
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   and in much assurance"
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   He's reminding the Thessalonians
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   of how the gospel had come to them.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   He left them, he writes his letter to them
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   what many think was his first letter
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   and it's a wonderful and a most important chapter this
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   in connection with this whole matter of preaching
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and he says that's how it came, you remember?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Not in word only, it did come in word.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Oh yes, exposition, exegesis, preparation, all of this
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   but not in word only
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   but also, it's this also, this addition
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   this is the thing that really makes preaching, preaching
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   this is the thing that produces converts in churches
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   and builds up churches
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   in power, Holy Ghost
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   and in much assurance
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and Peter puts his case in exactly the same way
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   where he reminds the people to whom he writes in his first epistle
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   1st chapter verse 12
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   he says, referring to the prophets
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   "Unto whom it was revealed
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   that not unto themselves but unto us
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   they did minister the things
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   which are now reported unto you
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   by them that have preached the gospel unto you
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   which things the angels desire to look into"
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   that's how the gospel is preached he says
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   with the Holy Ghost which is sent down from heaven
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and my last quotation is from the last book of the Bible
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   the book of Revelation
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   a statement by John about himself
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   in the first chapter and in verse 10
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and heard behind me a great voice"
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   how do you interpret that?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   is your position this that John being a Christian was always in the Spirit?
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   well if he was why does he trouble to say so?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   this wasn't something ordinary, something usual
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   this was something exceptional
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   he says "there was I on that isle of Patmos on the Lord's day
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   I found myself in the Spirit
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   a visitation of the Spirit of God
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   and it is as the result of this
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   he is given his great vision
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   and his great message and his great understanding
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   now there is the scriptural evidence and testimony
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   for all this
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   but now it may well be that your position is
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   yes that's alright we're in no difficulty about that at all
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   but all that ended with the apostolic age
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   therefore it's got nothing to do with us
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   well of course if that's your attitude to the scripture
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   I can't reason with you
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I take it that the scriptures are for us today also
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   and that if you are going to really get all this to the apostolic era
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   well you're leaving very little for us at the present time
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and how do you decide what was for then only and what is for us also?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   and what canons do you do that?
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   what are your canons of judgment?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   I suggest you haven't got any
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   the whole scripture is for us
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   here is a picture of the church and it's relevant
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   to the church at all times and in all ages
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   and thank God the history of the church proves
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   the rightness of this contention
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I could again give you great evidence
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   I could marshal evidence from the long history of the church
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   how this kind of thing has characterized the church always
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   in periods of revival and reformation
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   I've been doing this on Thursday nights
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   but some of you I know have not been there, you couldn't be there
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   you're good enough Christians to stay at home
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   and watch the children and allow your wives to come
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   so I'm repeating a little bit of this for you
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   a special benefit as a reward to you
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   because it is to me the most encouraging thing one can ever do
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   look at the situation we are confronted with today
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   look at the task, look at the state of the world
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   look at the mentality of men and women
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   without this it's a heart breaking task
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   I certainly couldn't go on for another day but for this
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   if I felt it was left to us
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   and our learning and our scholarship and our organization
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   I would be of all men the most miserable
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   the task would be completely hopeless
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   but that isn't the case
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   what we read of here is something that is possible for us today
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   and it is our only hope
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   but we've got to realize this
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   and if we don't realize it
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   we shall spend our time in shallows and in miseries
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   and we shall achieve nothing
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   very well then what's the evidence?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   well I could give you evidence before the Protestant Reformation
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   I'm not going to do so
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   but there's ample evidence at the time of the Reformation
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   there was that great experience that Luther himself had
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   in which he describes
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   when the whole room seemed to be filled with light
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   and that undoubtedly was the thing that made his preaching what it was
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   we are so interested in Luther the theologian
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   that we tend to forget Luther the preacher
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Luther was a mighty preacher
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   and the same is true of John Calvin also
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   but there were two men in England
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   who were very outstanding in this respect
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Hugh Latimer
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   and this man's preaching
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   outside St. Paul's Cathedral in London
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   was obviously attended with very great unction and power of the Holy Spirit
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   this again is something we tend to forget you see
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   we are rightly interested in the great theological upheaval
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   in the Protestant Reformation
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   but let's never forget
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   that it became a popular movement
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   it wasn't merely as it were the learned and the professors
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   it came down to the people
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   and there were these great preachers anointed with the Spirit
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   there was a man called John Bradford
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   who obviously was a very great preacher in this very sense
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   one of the men who was put to death
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   early on amongst those Protestant martyrs
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   and you've had this in almost every country
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   there was a mighty preacher in Scotland
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   at the end of that 16th century called Robert Bruce
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   now a little booklet was published about him
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   by the Banner of Truth people a few years back
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I hope it's selling in this country
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   if it is get it and read it
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Robert Bruce
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   not Robert the Bruce the King
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   but a much greater man
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   this was a servant of God
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   and you'll read about this man
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I remember reading in that book
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   about him on one occasion
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   going to a conference with ministers in Edinburgh
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   and things were very bad indeed
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   most discouraging
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   and they were talking to one another
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   but they were all very depressed
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and the more they talked the more depressed they became
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   as happens in general assemblies and other conferences
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   not infrequently
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   well Robert Bruce tried to get them to pray
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   and they were trying to pray
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   and it was just a question of trying to pray
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   but he didn't regard that as praying
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   so he was stirred in his spirit
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   as Paul seems to have been at Athens
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   and he said he was going to knock the Holy Spirit into them
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   and he began thumping on the table
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   and he certainly achieved something
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   because they then really did begin to pray
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   until they were lifted out of their depression
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   to the very heights
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   and given great assurance from God
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   and went back to their work
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   well these are but illustrations
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   but I'll give you my favourite illustration
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   do you know anything about John Livingstone
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   the man who lived again at the beginning of the 17th century in Scotland
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   John Livingstone was a very able man
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   most of these men were, Robert Bruce was
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   those early ministers, the reformed ministers in Scotland
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   were a tremendous succession of men
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   from the standpoint of ability and learning and knowledge
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   but the thing that characterises them above everything else
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   is their knowledge of this spiritual power and action
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   now John Livingstone I say was a very fine scholar and a great preacher
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   he'd had to escape to Northern Ireland on account of persecution
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   and he'd had some experiences there in a revival
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   but his great day came in 1630
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   there was a communion service at a place called Kirk or Shots
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   I always like to pass near that place
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   it's still there, not a big place
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   just off the road between Glasgow and Edinburgh
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Kirk or Shots, they were having a communion service
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and they'd all felt from the beginning right through till the Sunday
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   that there was something unusual
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   so the brethren, the fathers decided
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   that they'd have an additional preaching service on the Monday
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and they asked John Livingstone to preach
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   John Livingstone was a very modest and humble man
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   and he was fearful of this
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   so he spent most of the night struggling and praying
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   went out into the country and there he was praying
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   and the people were praying also
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   but he had a terrible time, he couldn't find peace
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   until in the early hours of Monday morning
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   God gave him a message
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   and also gave him assurance
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   that it was going to be with power
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   so John Livingstone preached on the Monday morning
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   and as the result of that one sermon
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   500 people were added to the churches in that locality
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   it was a tremendous day
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   an overwhelming experience
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   of the outpouring of the Spirit of God upon an assembled congregation
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   and this is what's always of interest to me
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   John Livingstone lived many years after that
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   he never had that sort of experience again
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   and he always looked back to it
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   and he always longed for it
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   but it was actually never repeated in his experience
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   you've had the same thing here
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   I derived great benefit a few years back
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   through reading the journals, I think they're called, of Cotton Mirtha
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   you know, the author of Magnalia Christi
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   I hope you've read it
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   there's nothing more important for preaching, as I said a few lectures back
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   than reading history, church history, biographies
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   read the history of religion in your own country
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Cotton Mirtha wrote it
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   he gave you accounts of different preachers and so on
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   but watch especially his descriptions in his own journal
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   of these visitations, as he would call them
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   of the Spirit of God
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   and the effect they had upon his preaching
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   well now again, I needn't remind you that Cotton Mirtha
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   was a very able and a very scholarly man
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   all those Mirthas were
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   and he'd got cotton in his blood as well, you see
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   John Cotton, another great scholar
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   the mixing of these two families, the Cottons and the Mirthas
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   you couldn't have a better pedigree, a better ancestry
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   if you're interested in intellect and ability
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   but you watch these men
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   and his realization of how he could really do nothing without this unction and power
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   time fails me
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   like the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   to tell you about Jonathan Edwards and David Brainerd
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   I do hope you know all about these men
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   all that can be known, and a great deal can be known
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   read them, read about them
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Gilbert Tennant in this area
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   same thing
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   how that man was used
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   for a period in particular
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   like a flaming sword
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   and then it seemed to have left him
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   and the remainder of his ministry here in Philadelphia
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   was a comparatively, I mustn't call it an ordinary ministry
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   but it wasn't at the same tremendous height
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   that it had been for a number of years
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   and then you know the story of course of
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Whitfield and the Wesleys
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   John Wesley is an important man in this whole argument
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   for several reasons
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   but one of them, and the most important in many ways is this
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   that if ever you had a scholarly man
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   it was John Wesley
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   if ever you had a typical Englishman
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   which means that he's not emotional
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   the Englishman is phlegmatic
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   he doesn't get excited, he doesn't get moved
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   he's not mercurial
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   nothing that characterizes some of the Celts amongst us and so on
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   now John Wesley was the most typical Englishman you could ever find
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   pedantic and exact
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   I think most of you men would have liked him very much
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   [laughter]
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   apart from his theology
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   but you see this is the story of John Wesley
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   fellow of his college in Oxford
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   exact in his exegesis, precise, every word in order
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   and a very good man and a very religious man
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   gave his spare time to visiting the prisoners in prison
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   he'd go with them to their death
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   he used to give his money to feed the poor
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   and even all this didn't satisfy him
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   gave up his position in Oxford
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   to cross the Atlantic to go and preach in Georgia
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   to the poor slaves and others
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   and he went
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   and he was absolutely useless
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   and he came to the conclusion that he needed the gospel
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   quite as much as these poor slaves did in Georgia
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   and he did
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   he'd got everything except this power
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   he wasn't quite clear in his doctrine
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   but he certainly had no power whatsoever
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   a complete failure
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   so he went back to England, useless
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   then having got back to England
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   he was first of all put right in the doctrine of justification by faith only
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   and he saw it clearly
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   but still he was no good as a preacher
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   and indeed he began to feel that he shouldn't preach
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   he said to that Moravian brother, Peter Burlar
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   who had helped him into this understanding of justification by faith
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   he said, you know, I see it so clearly with my head
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   but I don't feel it and I'd better stop preaching until I feel it
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   "No," said Peter Burlar in that immortal answer
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   "Don't stop preaching it, but go on preaching it until you do feel it"
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   and you remember what happened
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   on the 24th of May, 1738
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   he had that climactic experience
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   in a little meeting, a small meeting
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   in Aldersgate Street in London
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   a number of people had met together
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   you know, as Christian people do
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   to study the scriptures and to build one another up in the faith
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   and this particular night, this is what was happening
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   a man had been appointed to read the preface
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   of Luther's commentary on the epistle to the Romans
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   now, not the commentary, but the preface
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   and here was this man standing there
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   and the people sitting, listening to him
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   reading out of Luther's preface to his commentary on Romans
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   and as he was reading, Wesley says that his heart was strangely warmed
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   and he suddenly felt that God had forgiven his sins, even his
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   and he felt this warmth
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   something began to melt within him
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   and it was from that moment
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   that this man began to preach with power
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   and was greatly used with God
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   you see, all this is confirmatory of what I've told you in the scriptures
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   you can have the full preparation
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   without this, you'll have no power
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   it'll be non-effective
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   but from there on, with great power and might
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Whitefield tells us that he was aware actually
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   in his ordination service
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   of the power coming down upon him
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   he knew it, he was thrilled with the power
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   he went back to preach in his hometown of Gloucester
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   and it was an amazing meeting
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   indeed, it was so amazing
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   that some people wrote to the bishop, Bishop Benson
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   complaining about Whitefield
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   they said that as the result of his one sermon
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   15 people had become insane
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   the bishop, the bishop was not only a wise man, but a good man
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   he wished that all his clergy produced some effect on people
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   that most of them had no effect at all
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   so he was glad to hear of a man who had some effect
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   well of course, they were not insane
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   what had happened was, they'd come under terrible conviction of sin
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   and then, you see, even as now
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   when a man comes under conviction of sin
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   if he goes to a doctor
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   who is not like Dr. Dendalkia, a true and a fine Christian
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   he will be diagnosed as a religious mania
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   so they think he's mad
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   but actually what happens is
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   that the man has come under tremendous conviction
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   of the Holy Spirit of God
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   well, I could go on and tell you
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   about men in every denomination
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   in the little country I come from
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   two men, Howell Harris and Daniel Rowland
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   they tell you this so clearly
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Howell Harris, listen to this, he was a schoolmaster
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   convicted of sin
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   at Easter time in 1735
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   then in great trouble of soul
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Whitson, 1735
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   he gets assurance that his sins are forgiven
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   and he begins to enjoy this experience
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   three weeks later
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   he was sitting in the tower of a church
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   reading his scriptures and praying and meditating
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   when he says, God began to pour out his spirit upon him
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   and he says, oh it came wave after wave
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   until he could scarcely contain it
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   and it was from that moment
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   that that man felt his impulse to evangelize
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   his heathen neighbors
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   and at first what he used to do was
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   he'd visit the sick and he'd read good books to them
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   didn't say a word of his own, just read books
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   but there was such unction on his even reading of these books
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   that people were convicted and converted
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   and this went on for some time
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   then he began, he was so nervous
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   and felt he was so unworthy as a preacher
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   though he felt he was a little bit dishonest
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   he went on reading and he didn't disperse
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   some of his own remarks as thoughts came to him
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   and on he went like that for a while
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   but this man was the pioneer in a sense
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   in a movement that shook the whole country
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   and brought the denomination known as
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   the Calvinistic Methodists
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   and now Presbyterian Church of Wales
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   into being and into existence
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   that's how it happened
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   this special anointing and unction
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   then he would lose it for a while
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   and he would be grieving
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   then it would come back to him
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   and on he went like that until he died in 1773
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   and the same thing is true of others
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   well you've had other men
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   you've had a man called Asahel Nettleton in this country
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   read the biography of that man by Andrew Bonar
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Nettleton
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   and then you see in this extraordinary way
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   you've had it in very different types of men
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   most of the men I've been mentioning so far
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   are very good men
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   but there's a man like D.L. Moody
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   who in no sense was an able man at all
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   but he was a man greatly used of God
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   and if you read his life you'll find
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   it was as the result of an experience he had
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   walking down Wall Street in New York City
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   one afternoon
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   Moody remember had been a pastor of a church in Chicago before that
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   and he was a successful pastor
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   he was certainly doing a good work
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   but it pales into insignificance
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   when you put it in the light of the work that he was afterwards
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   unable to do
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   but let me give you as my last illustration
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   a most extraordinary thing
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   and I use this in order to show you
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   the character of this thing about which I'm speaking
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   you had a great revival in this country in 1857
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   it spread over to Northern Ireland in 1858
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   it spread to Wales in 1859
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   these revivals have generally happened simultaneously
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   in a number of countries at the same time
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   interesting in itself
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   but now I want to tell you about the man who was used of God in Wales
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   in that revival
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   his name was David Morgan
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   there is an English account of this man but
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   I'll tell you what is to me the most amazing thing in this story
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   there was a Welshman in this country of the name of Humphrey Jones
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   and he came under the power of the revival here
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   and having enjoyed this new life
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   and being filled with a spirit of joy and rejoicing
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   he said I wish my people at home could get this
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   and he began to feel this so much that he went home
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   and you realise what that meant in those days
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   and he went back and he just began to tell people
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   about what he'd seen and experienced here
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   and he would go around and speak in chapels
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   and the ministers and others would listen to him
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   well this man David Morgan had listened a number of times to Humphrey Jones
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   was interested, began to feel a longing for this
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   then he heard him one night
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   and Humphrey Jones was speaking with exceptional power
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   and this was David Morgan's testimony
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   he said I went to bed that night
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   David Morgan as usual
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   I woke up the next morning
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   feeling like a lion
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   feeling that I was filled with the power of the Holy Ghost
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   now before this he'd been a minister for a number of years
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   a good man, nothing exceptional, in fact an ordinary preacher
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   but a good man
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   nothing happened as a result of his preaching ever
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   but he woke up this morning feeling like a lion
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   and he began to preach with such power
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   that people were convicted all around and converted
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   and great rejoicing came in
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   and this went on
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   for over two years, wherever this man went
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   these tremendous results took place
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   I could tell you the story of the conversion of a man
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   go and look in the library
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   and if there is a commentary there on the first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   by T.C. Edwards
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   Thomas Charles Edwards, it's probably there
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   because it was in that series of commentaries
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   that was edited by
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   the editor of the British Weekly at the end of the last century
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   I'm not sure whether it was the International Critical
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   one of those series
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   now Thomas Charles Edwards was a great genius
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   his father was the president of a theological seminary
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   and this son T.C. Edwards was home on vacation
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   and heard that this David Morgan and another preacher
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   were going to preach in his town
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   and he describes how he went to the meeting
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   full of difficulties
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   his faith had been somewhat shaken by his reading of philosophy
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   and he was in trouble
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   didn't quite know where he was
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   and he said he went in that mood
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   just out of curiosity to see what these two simple preachers
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   could possibly be saying
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   and he'd heard a lot about this enthusiasm
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   and excitement of which he heartily disapproved
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   what happened to him?
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   well this is what happened to him
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   he'd got a red silk handkerchief in his pocket
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   they used to be common and popular at those times
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   and all he knew was this
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   that at the end of the meeting
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   the red silk handkerchief was torn to shreds
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   at the bottom of the pew in which he was sitting
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   he didn't know that he'd done it but he had done it
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   and his entire life was changed
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   his philosophical doubts were dispersed
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   all his uncertainties vanished like the morning mist
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   and this great scholar was filled with power
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   became the first principal of a university college
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   and eventually followed his father
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   as president of the theological seminary
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   well now this is it
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   this went on with David Morgan for two years
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   then this is the rest of his story
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   he said I went to bed one night
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   like this lion
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   filled with the power that I'd enjoyed
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   for the two years
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   I woke up the next morning
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   and found that I'd become David Morgan once more
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   he lived about 15 years afterwards
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   exercising the most ordinary ministry conceivable
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   the power came
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   the power was withdrawn
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   the lordship of the spirit
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   you can't commend this
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   you can't order it
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   it is entirely the gift of God
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   the examples I gave you from the scripture
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   indicate this
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Peter filled with the spirit
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   the spirit filled him
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   so he did with David Morgan
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   then in his own wisdom and sovereignty
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   he took it from him
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   revivals are not meant to be permanent
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   revivals
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   but at the same time
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   I do suggest to you
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   that you and I every time we preach
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   should be seeking this
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   how do we know when this happens
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   well let me try and tell you
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   the first thing is in the preacher's own consciousness
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   our gospel came not unto you in word only says Paul
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   but also in power and the holy ghost
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   and much assurance
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   who knew the assurance? Paul
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   he knew something was happening
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   he was aware of it
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   you can't be filled with the spirit without knowing it
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   he had much assurance
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   he knew he was clothed with power and authority
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   and how does one know it?
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   well it gives you clarity of thought
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   clarity of speech
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   ease of utterance
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   great assurance and confidence as you are preaching
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   an awareness of a power not your own
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   thrilling through the whole of your being
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   a joy
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   a blast
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   you are taken hold of
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   indeed I like to put it like this
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   and I know of nothing on earth that is comparable to this
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   when this happens
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   you really feel
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   that you are not doing the preaching
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   you are looking on
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   you are literally looking on at yourself
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   as this is happening
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   it isn't your effort
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   you are just the instrument
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   the channel, the vehicle
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   and the spirit is using you
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   and you are looking on with great enjoyment
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   and amazement
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   and astonishment
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   there is nothing I say that is in any way comparable to this
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   that is what the preacher is aware of
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   what about the people?
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   they know it at once
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   they can tell the difference immediately
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   they are gripped
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   they become serious
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   they are convicted
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   they are moved
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   they are humbled
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   they are convicted of sin
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   and they know at once
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   that this is quite unusual and exceptional
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   and then they begin to delight in the things of God
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   and they want more and more teaching
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   they are like the people in the book of Acts
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   they want to continue steadfastly
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   in the apostles doctrine and fellowship
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   and breaking of bread and of prayer
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   this has happened so often
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   very well, what do we do about it?
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   there is only one obvious conclusion isn't there?
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   seek him
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   seek him
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   what can we do without him?
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   seek him, seek him always
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   but go beyond seeking him
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   expect him
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   do you expect anything to happen when you get up to preach in a pulpit?
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   or do you just say well I have prepared my address
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   I am going to give them the address
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   some of them will appreciate it and some won't
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   are you expecting anything to happen?
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   you are expecting it to be the turning point in anybody's life?
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   you are expecting anybody to have a climactic experience?
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   this is what preaching is meant to do
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   Bible, subsequent history of the church
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   seek this power, expect this power
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   yearn for this power
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   and when the power comes, yield to him
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   don't resist
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   forget all about your sermon if necessary
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   let him use you
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   let him manifest his power in you and through you
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   and I am quite certain
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   as I have suggested several times before
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   that nothing
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   but a return of this
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   is going to avail us anything
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   this is true preaching
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   and it's the greatest need of all today
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   never more so
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   nothing can substitute for this
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   but given this
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   then you will have a people
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   who will be waiting and anxious
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   and ready to be taught and instructed
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   and led ever further onwards and forwards
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   into the truth
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   this unction, this anointing
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   is the supreme thing
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   let us pray
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   O Lord our God we do turn to thee
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   and pray that thou wouldst forgive us
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   for our self confidence
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   for our reliance upon ourselves
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   and the abilities that thou hast given us
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   and what we may know and have learned
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   Lord help us to see
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   that apart from thee we can do nothing
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   grant us to know something
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   and increasingly of that weakness, fear
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   and much trembling that thy servant the apostle knew
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   that we may long to be clothed with this power
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   and have this great assurance
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   which he had when he preached in Thessalonica
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   hear us O Lord
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   make us able ministers of the New Testament
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   shed upon us the power of thy Holy Spirit
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   we ask it in Christ Jesus name
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   Amen
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones
