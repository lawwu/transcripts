[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   The following is a conversation with Sergei Nazarov,
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.360]   CEO of Chainlink, which is a decentralized Oracle network
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.120]   that provides data to smart contracts.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.760]   He and his team have done seminal research
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.320]   and engineering in the space of smart contracts.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.420]   Check out the Chainlink 2.0 white paper
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.380]   that I found to be a great overview
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.320]   of their technology and vision.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.700]   It's 136 pages, but very accessible.
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.800]   Quick mention of our sponsors, Wine Access,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.080]   Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed, and BetterHelp.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.400]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.300]   As a side note, let me say that externally connected
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.340]   smart contracts that combine the ocean of data out there
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.660]   with the security of the blockchain are fascinating to me,
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.240]   both technically and philosophically.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.960]   Data is knowledge, and knowledge is power.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.120]   I think the more reliable data sources we integrate
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.200]   into our decision-making, especially when those decisions
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.880]   are executed by programs, the more efficient
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.480]   and productive our decisions become.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.460]   There are interactions between humans
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.060]   that should not be formalized digitally,
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.680]   like love, for example, but for all the others,
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.680]   there's no reason for smart contracts
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.840]   not to automate away the menial parts of life,
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.960]   making more room for good conversation over brisket
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.800]   and maybe some vodka with old and new friends.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.000]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.720]   and here is my conversation with Sergei Nazarov.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.400]   - Is that Jozhek there?
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.420]   - So I gave away everything I own a few times in my life,
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.040]   and he accidentally survived,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.720]   and I don't like stuffed animals.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.840]   What I really liked about, I got him in a thrift store.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.800]   What I liked about him is 'cause I'd never seen
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.600]   a stuffed animal that looks pissed off at life.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.440]   Like they're usually smiling in the dumbest of ways,
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.200]   and this guy was just pissed.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.000]   - Yeah, I gotta tell you, that's actually pretty funny.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.960]   - I like this guy.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.720]   If you had to live only in the digital world
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.160]   or the physical world, which would you choose?
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160]   - So I think this is actually a question more about
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.740]   what the fidelity of the digital world would be
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.380]   versus the physical world.
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.400]   I think this type of question, this whole simulation thing
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.640]   actually comes from papers about 20, 30 years ago
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.800]   in the philosophical world where people tried to make
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.520]   this thought experiment of would you be comfortable
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.360]   if everything that was happening to you
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.040]   happened in a simulation?
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.800]   What they were trying to do is they were intuitively
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.920]   trying to understand is there some kind of intuitive
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.680]   personal connection we have to something being
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.400]   the real world, right?
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.120]   And then the Matrix movie actually came out of these papers,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.800]   and then these ideas made their way
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.960]   into the public consciousness.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.500]   I personally think that if I had the choice
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.120]   to be in the digital world at the same fidelity
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.100]   as the real world with immortality,
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.600]   I would absolutely go with the digital world.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.640]   - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.440]   How'd you add the immortality part?
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.680]   That's a, you don't get immortality.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.760]   - If you think about how we would go into the digital world,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.440]   right, our brain patterns would be mapped
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.880]   onto some kind of probably virtual machine, right?
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.040]   And that would mean immortality, right?
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.240]   Because the virtual machine has no limit
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.080]   to how long it can exist.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.280]   - Well, don't you think there would be like
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.480]   a versioning system?
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.080]   Like there'd be, this is a soft fork
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.760]   versus hard fork question.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.160]   Whether Sergei version 2.0 would be different
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.600]   from Sergei version 1.0, there'd be an upgrade.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.040]   So that's a mortality.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   Sergei 1.0 would die in the digital world.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.000]   You get like a software update, and then that's it.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.340]   - Well, yeah, when people go into the Star Trek transporter,
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.640]   are they killed or are they transported?
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.040]   I don't really know.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.520]   I haven't read any papers on this.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.040]   I haven't really thought about it too much.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.800]   - There's no white paper on the transporter.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.240]   - Not at this point, so.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.720]   - Well, what does fidelity mean exactly to you?
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.040]   Is it like strictly, so the fidelity of the physics world,
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.760]   the physical world is maybe now questions of physics,
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.320]   quantum mechanics, what is at the bottom of it all?
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.640]   Or do you mean the fidelity of the actual experience?
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.400]   - It's just perception.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   It's just perception.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.280]   - But that's limited by human cognitive capabilities.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.160]   - It is, but I don't really have anything else, right?
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.320]   I think all of these papers that brought up these questions
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.560]   of assimilation, they were like in epistemology
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.960]   and metaphysics, and what they were trying to do,
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.080]   I think, was they were trying to put people
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.620]   through a thought experiment where they would come out
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.600]   on the other end and say,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.120]   the reality of life is really worth something,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.400]   and ignorance isn't bliss, which is that consistent
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.600]   statement in the matrix, right?
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.880]   Ignorance is bliss, that's what one of the guys says
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.520]   when he's doing something wrong
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.400]   and trying to get back into the matrix.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.600]   And the question is, is ignorance bliss?
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.840]   And it's like a different version of that.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.480]   I think from a perceptual point of view,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.680]   if my perceptions aren't in any way different,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.600]   so fidelity is very good, it doesn't matter.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.960]   I don't know, right?
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.880]   So if I don't know something, it doesn't really exist,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.800]   and if it doesn't exist in my perception
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.840]   or my consciousness, then it doesn't exist,
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.680]   period, for me, at least.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.160]   And then whether it exists in some more metaphysical
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.760]   version of things, I personally never really got
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.600]   into the metaphysics stuff because I could never really,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.720]   I couldn't understand what the point of it was, right?
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.160]   It's one of these things where I couldn't really get
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.320]   what the practical application of it was,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.560]   and this is from those realm of questions, right?
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.040]   Like if there was something about the world,
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.800]   but you didn't have a capacity to perceive it,
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.760]   would it matter to you?
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.160]   To me, it wouldn't matter.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.440]   - Right, to me, by the way, the simulation thing
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.760]   is a really interesting engineering question,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.760]   which is how difficult is it to engineer a virtual reality,
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.600]   a digital world that is sufficiently of high fidelity
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.080]   where you would want to live in it?
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.400]   I think that's a really testable
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.240]   and a fascinating engineering question
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.560]   'cause my intuition says it's not as difficult as we think.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.080]   It's not nearly as difficult as having to create
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.400]   a quantum mechanical simulation that's large enough
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.520]   to capture the full human experience.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.760]   It might be just as simple as just a really nice Quake game,
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.800]   like with a nice engine, just creating
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.440]   all the basic visual elements that tricked our cognitive,
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.520]   our visual cortex into believing that we're actually
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.720]   in a physical environment.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.280]   And I think that if that's true,
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.440]   then that's quite, a high fidelity digital world
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.640]   is actually achievable within a century.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.880]   And that changes things.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.000]   - Yeah, yeah, maybe in our lifetime.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.840]   I'm really hoping for that.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   I'm hoping somebody can copy my brain waves
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.400]   onto a virtual machine and allow that consciousness
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.760]   to continue to exist.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.040]   Whether that's death or not, I don't know.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.360]   But I think it's actually gonna require some serious leaps.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.560]   Like even the VR headsets, right?
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.440]   They don't work if they go below 90 frame rates, right?
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.200]   People start getting freaked out.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.800]   So you have to go from one gaming screen
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.920]   of 60 frames per second to two screens
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.360]   of 90 frames per second.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.240]   And so the people's hardware today can't even handle that.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.720]   And that's for these two little screens by your eyeballs.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.200]   What it's gonna take to completely trick my consciousness
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.600]   into not knowing the difference in terms of like,
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.520]   all the sensory inputs.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.880]   I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.320]   Whoever does that and is close to doing that,
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.720]   they should contact me.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.680]   I want to have my brain waves turned into a virtual machine.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.280]   - Would you in that context, if Morpheus came to you,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.520]   would you take the blue pill or the red pill?
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.320]   Meaning, would you be happy just living in that world
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.280]   and not knowing that you're living inside
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.800]   that virtual world that's running a computer?
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.640]   Or would you want to know the truth of it?
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.680]   - Well, actually, I think that's a very different question.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.520]   There's actually moral ethical question there
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.120]   about whether you should allow a bunch of people
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.940]   to get manipulated and killed and slaved.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.200]   'Cause in the matrix, they're all enslaved
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   as like a AAA battery to turn a human being
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.400]   into the battery, right?
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.560]   So I think the moral and ethical question of that,
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.120]   fascinating enough, isn't actually different
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.160]   than the moral and ethical questions we face today
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.960]   in modern daily life.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.600]   But I probably have given the choice
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.480]   of just completely going along or going against it.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.400]   I would probably go against it
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.040]   if I had to make this kind of binary choice.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.000]   Because going along with it,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.640]   I think at that scale of scary stuff happening to people,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.000]   is probably something really, really, really difficult.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.200]   - But for your individual life,
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.240]   it's way more fun to go along with it.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.360]   So you're saying you value
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.760]   opposing a system that includes the suffering of others
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.840]   versus just for yourself enjoying the ride?
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.400]   I mean, if there is such a binary choice,
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.920]   why choose the opposite system?
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.440]   - I think it's the nature of kind of the ethical dilemma
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.040]   that you face in that situation.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.560]   There's kind of some, you know,
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.880]   this is obviously not something that's happening now, right?
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.320]   - We don't know this, right?
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.240]   - We don't know this, but at the end of the day,
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.080]   at that scale of something like that happening,
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.080]   yeah, at that scale of people being manipulated and harmed,
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.760]   then I think pretty much almost all people
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.600]   have an obligation to go against it.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.620]   Probably that's what that looks like in my opinion.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.660]   - So you've talked about the concept of definitive truth.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.500]   What is it?
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.320]   And in general, what is the nature of truth
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.800]   in human civilization?
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.900]   And just talking about the digital age,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.080]   the nature of truth in the digital age.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.600]   - So the interesting thing about definitive truth
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.800]   is that it actually exists on this,
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.820]   at least in my mind, on this spectrum
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.720]   between objective truth and just, you know,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.800]   somebody made something up and nobody else agrees.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.960]   So what I think definitive truth is,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.100]   is it's somewhere in the middle on that spectrum
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.840]   where if you and me define what truth is, right?
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.240]   Like if you and me have an agreement of some kind
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.580]   and we say, as long as the weather is sunny
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.600]   or the weather isn't, there is no rain on that day,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.460]   then there'll be an insurance policy that results.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.880]   And you and me both agree that as long as three sensors,
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.480]   three weather monitoring stations all say that,
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.740]   then the definitive truth for us and for that agreement
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.500]   is the result of those systems coming to consensus
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.920]   about what happened out in the real world.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.040]   I think the objective truth definition
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.120]   from kind of the philosophical world
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   is really, really stringent and very, very hard to attain.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.960]   And that's not what this is.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.240]   And that's actually not what commerce
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.140]   or the ability for people to interact about contracts needs.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.940]   What I think the world of commerce needs is an upgrade
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.640]   from someone can unilaterally decide what the truth is
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.640]   to there can be a pre-agreed set of conditions
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.880]   where we define what the truth is under those conditions.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.600]   And then you and me basically say,
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   if these 20 nodes or of these 30 data sources
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.440]   come to consensus within this method of consensus
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.280]   with this threshold of agreement,
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.240]   then definitive truth has been achieved for you and me
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.340]   in our relationship for this specific agreement
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.200]   and the specificity and our shared agreement
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.480]   to that kind of truth or that definitive truth
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.000]   being acceptable to both of us
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.220]   is probably what's kind of necessary and sufficient
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.600]   for everything to move forward in a better way.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.640]   In any case, much better than,
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.440]   I'm a bank or an insurance company,
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.800]   I'm gonna unilaterally decide what happens.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.720]   It's definitely an upgrade from that.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.900]   - Do you think it's possible to define formally in this way,
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.360]   a definitive truth for many things in this world?
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.280]   Like you talked about weather,
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.400]   basically defining that if three sensors of weather agree,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.520]   then that we're going to agree
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.640]   that that is a definitive useful truth
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.640]   for us to operate under.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.360]   So how many things in this world
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.800]   can be formalized in this way, do you think?
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.240]   - A huge amount.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.240]   So there's actually two things going on here.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.880]   One thing is the amount of data that already exists,
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.440]   and the pieces of data coming off of markets,
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.240]   IOT, shipment of goods, any number of other things.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.800]   Like even your YouTube channel
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.560]   has a certain amount of likes
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.240]   or a certain amount of clicks or a certain amount of views,
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.600]   and even that's quantifiable.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.020]   So even to a certain degree, what we do here today,
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.720]   you and me right now can be quantified
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.920]   as far as the amount of views,
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.000]   the amount of clicks, the amount of any number of other--
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.320]   - You, the viewer, have power of data in your hands
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.680]   by clicking like or dislike right now,
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.360]   or the subscribe button or the unsubscribe button,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.960]   which I encourage you to do.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.280]   Anyway, okay, so there's data flowing
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.280]   into all interactions in this world, there's data.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.640]   - There's more and more data, right?
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.480]   - More and more data.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.300]   - More and more data,
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.420]   that data is more and more accessible to everybody,
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.140]   and that accessibility and the fact that there's more of it
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.840]   means we can form more definitive truth proofs.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.400]   We can form more and more proofs,
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.280]   and as we form those proofs,
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.520]   well, we can provide them to these blockchains
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.960]   and smart contract systems that consume them,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.600]   and then they're tamper proof, right?
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.280]   So they can't be manipulated.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.160]   And so now we've combined a system that can prove things
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.120]   with a system that guarantees us certain outcomes,
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.440]   and we have a better system of contracts,
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.680]   which is actually an unbelievably powerful tool
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.560]   that has never existed before.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.480]   - Can we talk about the world of commerce and finance,
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.080]   decentralized finance, what is it,
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.720]   what's its promise from both the philosophical
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.200]   and technical perspective,
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.080]   if we just zoom in on that particular space
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.040]   of the digital world?
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.160]   - Sure, so the centralized finance is the instantiation
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.360]   of a specific type of smart contract, right?
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.680]   Or what I call hybrid smart contracts,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.480]   which are these contracts that combine the on-chain code
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.200]   together with the off-chain proofs that something happened.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.520]   They're called a hybrid because they basically use
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.880]   both of these systems, right?
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.040]   The blockchain and the proofs about what happened.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.080]   And what DeFi is, is one specific type
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.360]   of hybrid smart contract that is taking on
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.880]   the contractual agreements you traditionally find
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.360]   in the global financial system, right?
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.440]   And that's basically the world of lending,
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.200]   the world of yield generation for people giving me
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.800]   or giving whoever their money
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.680]   and somebody giving back them, yield back to them,
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.960]   which is what bonds do and what treasuries do
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.120]   and what a lot of the global financial markets do,
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.360]   as well as the ability to gain exposure and protection
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.000]   from different types of events and risks.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.760]   That's a lot of what derivatives do, right?
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.240]   Derivatives allow us to say,
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.480]   "Hey, something's gonna happen
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.080]   and I'm either gonna protect myself by getting paid
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.280]   if it happens, or I'm going to benefit from it happening
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.960]   by basically saying it's gonna happen,
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.120]   putting money down on that
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.880]   and that prediction will get me a return."
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.640]   Now, that's a very large part
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.120]   of the global financial system,
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.120]   excluding all the stuff for global trade
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.960]   and letters of credit
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.320]   and all the stuff that facilitates international trade.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.920]   So excluding that at least for now.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.560]   So if we look at what decentralized finance does,
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.280]   it takes all of those agreements
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.400]   about generating yield, lending,
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.840]   and all of these types of things you find in global finance
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.160]   and the world of derivatives
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.040]   and a few other types of financial products.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.920]   And it basically puts them into a different format, right?
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.680]   So the format you have for centralized financial agreements
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.280]   is that you go to a bank, even if you're a hedge fund,
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.880]   even if you're like the richest people,
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.560]   you go to a bank, they make a product for you
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.640]   and you hope that they honor the product
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.720]   that they made for you.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.360]   Or you do a deal with another hedge fund
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.520]   or whoever, some counterparty,
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.400]   and you hope that that deal is honored.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.240]   - Yeah.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.720]   - And then a number of very freaky things
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.120]   start to take place.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.640]   One of them is people don't have clarity
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.840]   about what the agreement is, right?
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.120]   So a lot of people don't know exactly
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.920]   what the agreement is between those parties
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.800]   because they can't actually see it.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   Sometimes agreements are kept very private
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.360]   or parts of them are kept private.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.960]   And that keeps other counterparties,
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.840]   other people in the system
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.480]   from understanding what's going on.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.920]   This is actually partly what happened
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.160]   with the mortgage crisis.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.520]   The mortgage crisis in 2008 was basically,
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.680]   there were a lot of agreements, there were a lot of assets,
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.120]   but because the centralized financial system
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.960]   worked in such an opaque way,
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.560]   it was so unbelievably difficult
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.120]   to understand what was going on, right?
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.640]   And so that lack of understanding
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.800]   for the global financial system
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.360]   basically led to a big boom
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.800]   and then correspondingly, very, very big bust,
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.240]   which amazingly enough had a huge impact on everybody,
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.440]   even though they didn't participate
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.320]   in the boom part of the equation.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.640]   In any case, what decentralized finance does
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.480]   is it takes these financial contracts
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.320]   that power the global financial system.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.240]   It puts them in this new blockchain-based format
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.400]   that basically at this point
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.880]   provides three very powerful things.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.400]   The first thing that it provides is complete transparency
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.320]   over what's going on with your financial product.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.120]   So this means when you use a financial product
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.240]   in the DeFi format, you, and you as a technical person
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   actually can drill down very, very, very deeply.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.000]   And you can understand where the collateral is,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.720]   you can understand how much collateral there is,
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.280]   you can understand what format it's in,
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.680]   you can understand how it's changing,
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.440]   you can understand this on a second to second
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.320]   or block to block basis.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.800]   So you have complete transparency
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.120]   into what's going on in the financial protocol
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.800]   that you have your assets in,
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.640]   which is because blockchains and infrastructure,
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.320]   all of these things are built on,
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.720]   force that transparency.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.280]   Whereas the centralized financial system
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.440]   is very, very good at hiding it.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.880]   It's very good at hiding it
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.800]   and packaging things in a glossy wrapper,
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.360]   creating a boom, then a bust.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.560]   The centralized finance is built on infrastructure
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.200]   that forces transparency,
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.840]   such that everyone can understand
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.080]   what the financial product does from day one.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.320]   And in fact, escaping that property
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.720]   is practically impossible.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.360]   Or if someone tries to escape it,
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.720]   it becomes immediately obvious
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.680]   and people don't use their financial product.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.600]   So that's number one.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.680]   Number two is control.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.120]   So if you look at what happened with Robinhood,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.520]   everybody thought the system worked a certain way.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.720]   Everybody thought I have a brokerage account,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.240]   I can trade things under a certain set of market conditions.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.440]   And then the market conditions changed
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.200]   within the band of what people thought they could do.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.280]   And everybody was fascinated to find out that,
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.400]   oh my God, I thought my band of market conditions
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.800]   in which I can control my assets is X,
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.440]   but it is actually Y.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.400]   It's actually much, much smaller band.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.760]   And the reason it is a much, much smaller
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.400]   group of market conditions
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.760]   is that the system doesn't work
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.160]   the way people think it works.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.280]   The system was wrapped up in a nice glossy wrapper
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.840]   and given to them to get them to participate in the system
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.800]   'cause the system requires and needs their participation.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.480]   But if you actually look at how the system works underneath,
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.080]   you will see that it does not work
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.120]   the way people think that it works.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.400]   And this is actually another reason
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.520]   that DeFi is so powerful
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.280]   because DeFi actually, and these blockchain contracts,
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.040]   give people the version of the world
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.040]   they think they already have,
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.480]   which is why they don't beg for it.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.320]   So everybody thinks they're in a certain version
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.440]   of the world that works in this reliable way,
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440]   transparent way.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.760]   They're not.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.960]   They don't realize it.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.520]   And so they're confused when you tell them,
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.120]   I'm gonna make the world work this way
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.160]   because they think they're already in that world.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.240]   But then things like Robinhood
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.720]   make it immediately painfully clear
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.000]   that that's not how the world works.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.080]   So the second real property of DeFi is control,
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.200]   which means that you control your assets,
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.840]   not a bank, not a broker, not a third party, you.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.960]   You control your Bitcoins,
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.280]   you control your tokens in the finance protocol.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.200]   If you don't like how something's going in that protocol,
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.040]   you can remove it.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.800]   You can send it to another protocol,
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.440]   or you can use a feature of the protocol
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.960]   to do something it's supposed to do.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.800]   And guess what?
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.880]   Nobody can just say, oops, that feature,
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.240]   that isn't so good for my friends over here.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.560]   That feature is actually,
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.960]   we're just gonna pause that feature
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.480]   in the critical moment when you need it
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.440]   to execute your strategy,
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.200]   which is why you took all the risks to begin with.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.520]   And then the final reason,
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.480]   the final thing to know about DeFi
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.160]   is that DeFi is inherently global,
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.920]   and actually right now provides better yield globally.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.640]   So if you go to a bank right now with the US dollar,
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.800]   you get 1% or less.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.000]   If you go to DeFi with the US dollar,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.720]   you get 7% or 8%.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.600]   So if we think about that in a world
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.080]   where there's a lot of inflation coming down the road,
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.240]   and we think about, well,
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.440]   a lot more systems might be failing soon,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.280]   and they might be highlighting these types of problems
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.200]   that were there for,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.240]   or as a result of the type of control
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.640]   that you see in Robinhood,
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.240]   and people are more and more concerned
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.960]   about both transparency and control,
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.040]   and they're looking for yield to combat inflation,
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.800]   I think that's what DeFi is about in a practical sense.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.880]   It is this clarity about your risk,
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.320]   it is control over your assets,
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.600]   and amazingly, at the same time
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.760]   as having those two unbelievably useful properties,
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.200]   it is actually superior yield,
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.000]   which just leads me to the very obvious conclusion
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.880]   that the only reason DeFi isn't more used
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.240]   is 'cause more people don't know about it,
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.000]   and by virtue of this long kind of explanation
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.880]   here and elsewhere, more people will know about it,
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.680]   and it's just such an obviously superior solution
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.720]   that I haven't heard a single explanation
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.160]   as to why, no, no, don't earn 8% and take less risk
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.640]   and have more transparency with your assets,
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.800]   earn 7% less, take more risk,
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.640]   and give people the ability to change the rules on you
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.200]   at their discretion, go do that.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.280]   Who's gonna do that?
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.960]   - And in general, on the first two
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.440]   of transparency and control,
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.040]   first of all, I do think, maybe you can correct me,
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.800]   but from my perspective, they're deeply tied together
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.760]   in the sense that transparency gives control.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.880]   - Transparency creates accountability,
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.400]   and there's this kind of game being played,
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.280]   game theoretic game, where if I know,
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.600]   if you know I'm gonna discover your deviation,
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.240]   you're not gonna deviate.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.760]   - Yes, this could be a whole 'nother conversation,
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.560]   but just as a small aside,
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   on the social network side of things,
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.160]   which I've been thinking deeply about in the past year or so
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.040]   of how to do it right there,
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.360]   how to fix our social media,
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.800]   and I tend to believe that human beings,
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.240]   if they're given clear transparency
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.160]   about which data is being stored, how it's being used,
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.800]   where it's being moved about,
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.840]   just all a clear, simple transparency
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.440]   of how their data is being used,
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.720]   and them having the control at the very minimal level
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.840]   of being able to participate or to walk away,
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.920]   and walk away means delete everything
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.400]   you ever known about me,
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.960]   that will create a much, much better world.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.480]   That currently there's a complete lack of transparency
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.720]   in the social media, how the data is being used
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.560]   for your own protection.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.520]   I mean, there's a lot of parallels
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.480]   to the central bank situation,
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.640]   and there's not a control element
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.080]   of being able to walk away.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.360]   Like being able to delete all your data,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.400]   delete your account on Facebook is very difficult.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.600]   It doesn't take a single click,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.920]   which I think is what it should take.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.000]   There should be a big red button that says,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.360]   delete everything you've ever known about me,
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.240]   or like forget me.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.680]   So I think that couple together can create
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.760]   a very different kind of world,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.760]   and create an incentivization that will lead
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.640]   to like progress and innovation,
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.640]   and just like a much better social network,
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   and a really good business for the future social networks.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.160]   But so I tend to see like control as naturally
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.680]   being a sort of an outgrowth from the transparency.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.520]   It should all start at the transparency,
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.000]   which is why the smart contract formulation is fascinating.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   'Cause like you're formalizing in a simple, clear way,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.480]   any agreements that you're participating in.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.640]   And as a side comment also,
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.000]   what's really inspiring to me is that I think
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.760]   there's a greater, I don't know if this is always the case,
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.520]   but it seems like from having talked to people
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.640]   on the psychological element,
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.640]   there's a hunger amongst people for transparency
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.280]   and for control.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.240]   Like transparency, another word for that is authenticity.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.560]   If you look at the kind of stuff that people hunger for now,
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.840]   they want to know the reality of who you are as an individual.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.880]   So that means you can create businesses,
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.000]   you can create tools that are built on authenticity,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.200]   a transparency.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.920]   And then the same, I'm inspired by the intelligence
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.120]   of people if you give them control,
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.800]   if you give them power, that they would make good choices.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.080]   That's really exciting.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.320]   Of course, not everybody,
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.320]   but that means that decentralized power
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.720]   can create effective systems.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.880]   So a couple of that, there's a hunger for transparency
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.400]   so we can move to a world where everyone's being
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.920]   just like real, conveying their genuine human nature.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.160]   And people are sufficiently intelligent
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.800]   that if they're given power in a distributed mass scale sense
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.480]   that we're going to build a better world through that,
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.160]   as opposed to centralized supervised control,
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.600]   where only a small percent of the population
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.560]   know what the hell they're doing
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.720]   and everybody else is clueless sheep.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:35.240]   So those two coupled together is really, to me, inspiring.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.880]   - Just to really quickly comment on the stuff
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.480]   that you just said, which I think is super,
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.440]   super, super fascinating.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.760]   I think that's all exactly right.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.720]   I think everything that you said is right.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.040]   And I think it's actually going to be the same
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.040]   for social media and banking and every other type of contract
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.680]   is that all of those systems that house people's value
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.760]   for them and take control of either their social media value
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.120]   or their financial value or whatever for them,
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.480]   all of that is going to be made available to people
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.200]   in this autonomous piece of code
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.480]   that does the same thing
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.800]   that the centralized entity used to do.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.760]   So they get all the features,
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.360]   but the autonomous piece of code gives them the ability
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.040]   to have control while getting all the features.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.040]   - Right.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.840]   - So banks give you features,
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.520]   social media sites give you features,
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.560]   whatever other system that you use online gives you features
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.120]   and then it takes your data
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.720]   and it takes control of your assets from you
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.480]   in return for those features.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.320]   Right?
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.520]   I think the whole big difference here,
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.040]   partly in line with the definition of smart contracts
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.240]   and its evolution,
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.960]   is that there's this autonomous piece of code
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.400]   that's giving you all those features
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.400]   without requiring the ownership and lock-in and control
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.440]   and unilateral kind of ownership of your data or your value
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.920]   or whatever it is that you're giving it.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.800]   Right?
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.200]   And I think what this will lead to fundamentally
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.800]   is just more of a free market dynamic
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.120]   among how people make...
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.880]   I think with the social media folks,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.760]   you should just make some kind of law or something
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.240]   where you can just export all your data from them.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.960]   Everyone should be able to get their data exported
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.680]   by another application.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.520]   And then the network effect of all these social media sites
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.360]   will kind of crumble
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.840]   'cause people will just combine your Twitter data
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.000]   with your Facebook data, with everything else,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   into an application that you control.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.800]   And there'll just be thousands of different interfaces
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.680]   competing for how to consume all the social media data
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.920]   because it isn't locked in
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.400]   in one centralized actor's control.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.840]   And so this is just the recurring pattern
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.600]   of what I think all of this will do
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.760]   is it'll give people a better deal.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.600]   Right?
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.960]   It gives them features without ownership of data,
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.800]   without ownership of value.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.600]   And that's really the difference.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.880]   - So I think this is a good place
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.520]   to talk about smart contracts then.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.880]   Can you tell me the history of smart contracts
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.640]   and the basic sort of definitions of what is it?
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.480]   - Sure.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.840]   So I think smart contracts as a definition
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.200]   has actually gone through some kind of changes
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.960]   or a small evolution.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.200]   Initially, I think it was actually a conception
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.880]   of a digital agreement that was tamper-proof
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.080]   and could know things about the world, right?
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.280]   So it could get proof
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.240]   and it could define that something happened
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.520]   and it could conclude an outcome
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.120]   and release payment or do something else.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.320]   That's actually the definition of smart contracts
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.400]   that I began working in this industry with
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.560]   seven or eight years ago
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.480]   when I started making smart contracts.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.880]   That is the conception that I had of a smart contract.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.880]   Then what happened was that was really hard to do, right?
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.200]   Building that type of tamper-proof digital agreement
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.640]   that could also know things about the real world
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.200]   and release payments back to people about those events
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.440]   that were codified in this tamper-proof format
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.400]   was actually a very tall order.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.040]   Turns out it's consistent of three parts.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.560]   It's consisting of the contract,
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.720]   the proof about what happened
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.480]   and the release of value.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.400]   The way things have evolved so far
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.240]   is that the definition has now come to mean on-chain code,
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.080]   right?
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.360]   So it's come to mean the codification
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.600]   of contractual agreement on a blockchain, right?
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.000]   So there's some code somewhere on some blockchain
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.160]   that defines what the agreement is.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.720]   Now, that eliminates the part of the definition
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.040]   that's related to knowing things about the world
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.000]   and it partly eliminates the definition about payments
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.840]   and stuff like that.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.480]   But basically it's on-chain code, right?
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.920]   We in our recent work on a second white paper
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.080]   have actually put out a different definition
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.400]   that we call hybrid smart contracts
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.360]   that actually tries to go back to the initial definition
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.080]   that I started with seven or eight years ago,
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.120]   which basically says that there's some proof somewhere
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.400]   that's proven to the contract
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.840]   and the contract can know that
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.800]   and the contract can gain proof.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.000]   Then it can use that proof to settle the agreement
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.480]   that's codified on a blockchain.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.400]   So you both need a mechanism to provide proof,
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.680]   you need a mechanism to codify the contract
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.440]   in a tamper-proof way on something like a blockchain.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.840]   And then as with all contracts,
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.080]   there's a presumption that there's some kind
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.440]   of release of value.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.240]   So I think a smart contract in our industry right now
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.000]   means on-chain code,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.040]   which limits it to whatever can be done on-chain only.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.000]   And then in our internal definition for us,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.480]   and for us at Chainlink and for me,
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.600]   it's hybrid smart contracts,
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.480]   which is actually the original definition.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.520]   It's the idea that a contract can both know what happened
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.720]   and automatically resolve to the proper outcome
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.000]   based on what happened.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.080]   - So you're referring to the Chainlink 2.0 white paper,
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.640]   which is a paper that I recommend people look.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.200]   It's a very easy read and very well-structured
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.400]   and very thorough, so I really enjoyed it.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.000]   Very recently released, I guess.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.960]   Can you dig in deeper?
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.120]   What is a hybrid smart contract?
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.800]   You mentioned sort of this idea of data
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:05.640]   or knowing about the world and on-chain and off-chain.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.680]   So what are the different roles in this?
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.600]   So hybrid, by the way, refers to the fact
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.920]   that it's on-chain and off-chain contracts.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.560]   So maybe dig in deeper of what the heck is it
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.640]   and what does it mean to know stuff about the world?
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.720]   Like how do you actually achieve that?
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.080]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.520]   So the on-chain part is where the agreement itself is.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.960]   That's the smart contract itself.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.080]   And that's where you codify certain conditions,
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.120]   such as the conditions under which
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.320]   an interest payment is made,
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.320]   or the conditions under which the contract
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.360]   pays out the full amount that it holds
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.440]   to someone based on a derivative outcome
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.080]   or something like that.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.160]   Now, what the on-chain code is very good at
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.160]   is creating transparency about what the core conditions
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.960]   of the contract are.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.920]   It's very good at taking in money
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.680]   from other private keys that send it tokens
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.840]   and send it value to hold.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.680]   And then it's also very good at returning money
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.480]   or returning value back to other addresses
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.040]   or other private keys.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.560]   It can also be involved in governance.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.640]   It can be involved in a few other
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.400]   private key signature-based operations.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.160]   But primarily the on-chain part of a hybrid smart contract,
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.880]   from what I've seen so far,
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.440]   defines the agreement, takes in value,
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.360]   and returns value based upon the conditions codified
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.480]   in the agreement on a blockchain.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.400]   The second and equally important off-chain part
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.280]   is where the term an oracle comes in,
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.480]   or an oracle mechanism,
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.520]   or a decentralized oracle network,
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.320]   as we describe it in the paper.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   And this is another decentralized computational system
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.040]   that has a different goal.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.280]   So blockchains have the goal
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.640]   of packaging transactions into blocks
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.320]   and connecting them in a cryptographically unique way
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.880]   to create security and assurance
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.720]   about that chain of transactions.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.640]   Oracles and decentralized oracle networks
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.280]   achieve consensus and they achieve decentralization
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.960]   about the topic of what happened.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.440]   So blockchains structure transactions.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.200]   Some of those transactions might be the state changes
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.880]   in different pieces of on-chain code.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.880]   And then those on-chain pieces of code require input.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.800]   I think the thing that people
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.560]   get kind of a little bit thrown by
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.760]   is despite being called smart contracts,
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.080]   the on-chain code on a blockchain
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.480]   cannot actually speak to any other system.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.280]   So blockchains are valuable and useful
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.600]   as far as they're tamper-proof and secure.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.120]   And to be tamper-proof and secure,
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.080]   they're made this kind of walled garden
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.800]   that is able to know and interact
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.520]   only with the highly reliable information
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.720]   that's within that system,
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.160]   which is basically tokens and private key signatures.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.760]   All the other world's information
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.160]   is not available in a blockchain inherently.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.920]   And a smart contract or a piece of on-chain code
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.920]   can't just say,
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.600]   "Hey, I'm going to go get some data from over here,"
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.680]   because the API they would get it from
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.720]   creates a whole bunch of security concerns
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.320]   for the blockchain itself
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.840]   and a whole bunch of consensus issues
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.600]   about how to agree on what that API said
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.200]   or what the truth of the world is, right?
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.240]   Because it's not even agreeing on what one API said.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.480]   It's more so creating a reliable form
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.280]   of decentralized computation
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.880]   that can give you a definitive proof of what happened
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.680]   and not just what one API said.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.360]   So for example, some of our most widely used networks
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.320]   have well over 30 nodes and well over 10 data sources
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.880]   that are all providing information
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.520]   about the same type of data.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.840]   And then there's consensus on that one piece of data,
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.280]   which is then written in and essentially given back
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.760]   into the on-chain code to tell it what happened.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.160]   Because you can't really make an agreement
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.200]   unless you know what happened, right?
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.560]   If you and me were to make an agreement
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.320]   and set some contractual conditions,
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.840]   but our agreement could never know what happened,
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.560]   it would be completely useless.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.280]   However, if you and me made an agreement
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.520]   and there was another system called an Oracle mechanism
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.920]   or decentralized Oracle network
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.520]   that proved what happened definitively,
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.920]   and you and me pre-agreed
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.000]   that whatever this mechanism says is what happened,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.680]   then we can achieve an entirely new level of automation, right?
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.480]   We can suddenly say,
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.400]   there's this piece of on-chain code that's highly reliable.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.480]   We can give it millions, billions,
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.760]   eventually trillions of dollars in value.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.720]   And it is controlled by this other system over here
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.480]   that's also highly reliable
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.920]   under this configurable set of definitive truth
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.400]   and decentralization conditions,
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.360]   which we all agree are sufficiently stringent
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.240]   to control that much value.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.720]   And therefore, the combination
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.120]   of this tamper-proof on-chain representation of a contract
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.080]   and this mutually agreed upon definition
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.520]   of a trigger or a proof system combined
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.640]   is a hybrid smart contract,
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.200]   which as you can see probably already
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.760]   does a lot more than just a contract on-chain, right?
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.520]   - Can you talk about this consensus mechanism,
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.480]   which by the way is just fascinating.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.400]   So there is the on-chain consensus mechanism
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.560]   of proof of work and proof of stake.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:19.560]   And then there is this Oracle network consensus mechanism
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.480]   of what is true.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.920]   So how do you, can you compare the two?
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.800]   Like, how do you achieve that kind of consensus?
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.840]   How do you achieve security
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.440]   in integrating data about the world?
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.160]   In a way that's definitively true,
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.120]   in a way that is usefully true,
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.400]   such that we can rely on it in making major agreements
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.160]   that as you said, involve billions of trillions of dollars.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.800]   - Right, so this is the challenging question, right?
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:56.440]   This is the challenging problem that Oracle networks,
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.560]   Oracles, we at Chainlink that we work on
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.720]   in order to create this definitive truth
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.280]   to trigger and create hyper automation
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.520]   in this more advanced form,
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.120]   more advanced form of hybrid smart contracts.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.280]   The reality I think of this problem
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.360]   is that it is very specific to each use case.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.640]   And this is actually how we've architected our system
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.640]   is in a very flexible way.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:27.120]   So for example, you need an ability for an Oracle network
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.200]   to grow in the amount of nodes that it has
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.080]   relative to the value it secures, right?
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.840]   So if you have an Oracle network
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   that secures $100,000 in like a beta of a financial product,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.520]   maybe it can be fine with only seven nodes
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.320]   and only two or three data sources, right?
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.000]   Because the risk to that Oracle network
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.440]   is relatively low based on the value it secures.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.040]   So the first question is actually
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.880]   how do you scale security relative to value
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.360]   secured by that Oracle network?
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.720]   Because it wouldn't be very efficient
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:05.720]   to have a thousand nodes securing $100,000 worth of value.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.280]   So one of the first questions is how do we properly scale
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.600]   and how do we compose ensembles of nodes
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.400]   in a decentralized way where we can know that,
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.880]   okay, we're going from seven nodes in a network
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.880]   to 15 to 31 to 57 to 105 to a thousand, right?
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.360]   So that's one dimension of the problem.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.000]   - So you have to be scaling the number of nodes
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.640]   relative to the value that's derived
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.960]   from the truth integrated into those nodes.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.440]   - Well, that's not the only problem, right?
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.120]   The other side of this is that you're trying to create
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.440]   a deterministic result, a deterministic output
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.800]   from a set of non-deterministic disparate systems,
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.480]   data sources, or places that prove things.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.520]   - Can you also just as an aside, what is an Oracle node?
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.880]   What is the role of an Oracle node?
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.680]   - Sure, so an Oracle node essentially exists
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.520]   in both places, it exists in both worlds.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.920]   It exists as an on-chain contract that represents
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.400]   either an Oracle network or an Oracle node.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.320]   So there's an on-chain interface in the form of a contract
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.000]   that says, I exist to give you this list of inputs.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.880]   You can request weather data from me,
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   you can request price data from me,
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.480]   you can ask me to send a payment somewhere.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.440]   - Like an API, so it's a pointer to a API
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.880]   that provides truth about this world.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.040]   - It's an interface.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.800]   So just like an API is an interface for Web 2.0 engineers,
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:39.480]   Oracle networks and the contracts that represent them
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   or individual nodes are the interface
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.560]   of Web 3.0's use of services.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:50.560]   And services includes all services, data, payment systems,
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.040]   messaging systems, whatever Web 2.0
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.280]   or any kind of computing service that you can conceptualize
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.720]   needs an interface on-chain in the form of a contract
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.840]   that says, here are the services I can provide for you,
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.320]   here are the transactions you need to send me
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.280]   to get back this data or that computation or this result.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.400]   And then what you actually see
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.040]   is that the centralized Oracle networks,
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.000]   because they're uniquely capable of generating
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.800]   their own computations in a decentralized way
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.400]   around the data that they have access to,
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.760]   you actually see decentralized Oracle networks
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.360]   generating a lot of these services.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.480]   So for example, we have a randomness service,
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.120]   a verifiable randomness function service
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.040]   that basically provides randomness on-chain
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.160]   and that randomness is then used in lotteries
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.240]   and various other contracts that need randomness.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.400]   But that randomness, it's not a piece of data
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.680]   that comes from somewhere else.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.560]   We don't go to another data source and get it,
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.040]   we generate it within an Oracle node
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.120]   that then provides it over into Oracle node
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.280]   or Oracle nodes that provide it
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.160]   into the contracts themselves.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.760]   - So why do you say Oracle nodes are non-deterministic?
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.080]   - Well, they are as far as they come to consensus,
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:05.720]   but see, there's this kind of different problem here, right?
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.160]   The blockchains are very focused
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.720]   on generating blocks of transactions
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.600]   within a smaller universe of transaction types,
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.880]   a certain block size and a certain set of conditions.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.640]   And then they have a economic system that says,
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.280]   I will perpetually generate blocks of this size
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.760]   with these transaction types
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.320]   in this kind of limited set of transaction types,
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.240]   whether those are UTXO transactions
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.840]   or scripted solidity or whatever it is.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.400]   Oracles and Oracle networks,
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.840]   we don't have a blockchain, for example,
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.680]   there is no chain-linked blockchain.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.920]   Our goal is not to generate a certain set
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.280]   of very clearly predetermined transaction types
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.120]   into a set of transactions that are put into blocks
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.720]   and it will infinitely be done that way.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.840]   Our goal is actually to create what we call a meta layer,
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.440]   a decentralized meta layer
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:01.440]   between the non-deterministic, highly unreliable world
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.760]   and the highly hyper-reliable world of blockchains
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.480]   so that the unreliable world can be passed
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.120]   through this decentralized meta layer.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.920]   - And it can coexist with the reliable on-chain world.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.000]   - Exactly, it can coexist and in some cases,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.840]   the meta layer might generate it.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.280]   So the problem in giving you this straight answer
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:24.200]   is that there's just such a wide array of services.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.880]   If you were to say, well, Sergey,
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.880]   how do we generate randomness from a data source?
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.040]   Well, we don't use a data source
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.320]   to generate the randomness,
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.200]   that's the type of service that can be generated
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.280]   in an Oracle network itself.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.160]   And so there'll be certain computations
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.280]   that Oracle networks themselves generate themselves
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.040]   to augment and improve blockchains.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.600]   And it is actually the goal of Oracle
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.760]   is to consistently do that.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.320]   So if you were to think about the stack
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.220]   in a very generic high level,
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.400]   you would see blockchains are databases.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.720]   They're basically the data structures
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.800]   that retain a lot of information
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.400]   in this transparent, highly reliable form.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.880]   Smart contract code is the application logic.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.240]   It is the logic under which all of this
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.320]   kind of activity occurs,
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.480]   storing data in the data structure, in the blockchain
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.720]   as a database in a certain conceptualization of it.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.760]   And then Oracles and Oracle networks
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:21.840]   are all the services that are used by the application code.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.340]   So by analogy, let's take Uber.
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.880]   Uber initially, some core code goes and gets the GPS API
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.000]   from Google Maps about the user's location,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.280]   sends a message to the user through Twilio,
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.840]   pays the driver through Stripe.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.760]   If those services weren't available
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.280]   to the people who made Uber,
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.680]   they wouldn't have made Uber, right?
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.160]   Because they would have written their core code
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.280]   on some database,
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.840]   and then they would have had to make a geolocation company,
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.680]   a telecom messaging company,
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.320]   and the global payments company.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.640]   And they wouldn't have done that because it's too hard.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.460]   And that's the weird scenario
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.480]   that a lot of people in our industry are in.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.340]   And that's the problem that Oracles
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.980]   and Oracle networks fix,
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.960]   is they provide these decentralized services
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.920]   to take this developer ecosystem,
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.680]   the blockchain and smart contract developer ecosystem from,
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.520]   hey, I can have a database
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.120]   and write some application logic
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.000]   about tokenization and voting and private key signing,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.260]   all of which is super useful and is a critical foundation.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.720]   But now if you just layer on all the world's services,
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.560]   whether that's market data, weather data, randomness,
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.800]   suddenly people can build DeFi, fraud-proof gaming,
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.200]   fraud-proof global trade, fraud-proof ad networks.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.640]   And that's why this world of decentralized services
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.000]   and decentralized Oracle networks is particularly,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.760]   in my opinion, important to our industry.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.600]   - Yeah, it's funny.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.640]   And you talk about that the currents
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.200]   of decentralized world, DeFi,
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   but decentralized services world is primarily just tokens.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.920]   And it's basically just financial transactions.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.800]   And the kind of thing,
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.520]   the reason why it's super exciting,
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.800]   the kind of thing you're doing with Chainlink
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.180]   and Oracle networks,
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.160]   is that you can basically open up
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.600]   the whole world of services
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:07.920]   to this kind of decentralized smart contract world.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   I mean, you're talking about just orders of magnitude
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.440]   greater impact financially and just socially
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.440]   and philosophically.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.320]   Are there interesting near-term
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.000]   and long-term applications that excite you?
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.680]   - Yeah, there's a lot that excites me.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.920]   And that is how I think about it,
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.880]   that it's not just about,
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.880]   we made a decentralized Oracle network.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.120]   It's about, we made a decentralized service
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.400]   or collection of services
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.600]   that's going from hundreds to thousands
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.000]   and then people are able to build
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.440]   the hybrid smart contracts,
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.200]   which I think will redefine what our industry is about.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.040]   Because for example,
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.960]   for the people that only learned about blockchains
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.080]   through the lens of NFTs,
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.360]   they understand blockchains through NFTs,
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.160]   not through speculative tokens or Bitcoins, right?
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.800]   And I think that will continue.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.280]   I think the use cases that excite me,
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.000]   they vary between the developed market,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.440]   the developed world's economies and emerging markets.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.200]   I think in the developed world,
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.160]   what you will see is that transparency,
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.840]   creating a level, a new level of information
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.480]   for how markets work and the risk that is in markets
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.640]   and kind of the dynamics that put
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.400]   the global financial system at systemic financial risk,
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.600]   like 2008.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.880]   And my hope is that all of this infrastructure
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.960]   will soften the boom and bust cycles
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.280]   by making information immediately available
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.000]   to all market participants,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.680]   which is by the way, what all market participants want,
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.280]   except for the very, very, very small minority
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.800]   that are able to game the system and their benefit
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.640]   and benefit from booms, but avoid busts
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.200]   because of their asymmetric access to information,
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.680]   which really everybody should have
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.840]   and which this technically solves.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.760]   I think in the process of doing that,
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.320]   and which is happening, I think right about now,
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.640]   you see a polishing of the technology
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.680]   such that it can be made available to emerging markets.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.960]   And on a personal level,
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.800]   I feel that the emerging markets will benefit much more
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.120]   from this technology,
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.360]   just like the emerging markets benefit much more
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:12.440]   from the internet or from those $50 Android phones
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.760]   that people can have,
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.960]   because it's such a massive shift
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.920]   in how people's lives work, right?
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.320]   I have always had access to books and a library,
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.200]   which has been fantastic and very important,
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.520]   but there are places in the world
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.480]   where people don't have libraries,
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.920]   but now they have the internet and a $50 Android phone,
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.960]   and they can watch the same Stanford lecture that I watch.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.800]   I mean, that's kind of mind-blowing, realistically, right?
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.200]   They just went from zero to one
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.300]   in a very, very dramatic way.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.440]   I think all of these smart contracts,
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.080]   and in my case, I think the one
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.380]   that I seem to keep coming back to is crop insurance,
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.880]   where partly 'cause it doesn't have
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.000]   a tokenization component,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.520]   partly 'cause it's actually much more important
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.300]   than it might seem.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.760]   - What is crop insurance?
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.640]   - Right, so, exactly.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.440]   So this is the nature of why it's sometimes hard
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.320]   to see the full value of what our industry does,
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.480]   because it solves all these kinds of backend problems
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.520]   that we don't have, right?
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:12.640]   So crop insurance is if I own a farm and it doesn't rain,
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.280]   I get an insurance payout,
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:16.320]   so I don't need to close down my farm,
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.680]   because if it didn't rain, I don't have crops, right?
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.800]   So people in the developed world can get crop insurance,
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.640]   and there's all kinds of systems
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.800]   that basically pay them out,
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.600]   and then they can argue with the insurance company
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.000]   if they don't get paid out properly and whatever.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.120]   And this allows people to smooth out risk.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.840]   In fact, a lot of the global options markets
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.320]   were about this, right?
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.500]   They were initially about people selling their produce
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.320]   or their crops ahead of time,
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.400]   so that if there was a risk of drought,
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.760]   they weren't impacted by it, right?
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.480]   And that's where a lot of options trading
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.840]   and all this kind of stuff came from,
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.760]   even though it's now turned into this kind of global casino.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.080]   But in the emerging market,
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.400]   there are literally people that,
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.640]   if they don't have rain for two seasons,
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.000]   they need to close down their farm
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.380]   and become a migrant worker of some kind.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.280]   And now they have a $50 Android phone
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.220]   where they can read Wikipedia,
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:15.520]   but they're still decades away from an insurance company
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.400]   coming to their geography and offering them insurance
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.640]   because their local legal system
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.160]   simply doesn't allow that type of thing to exist.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.640]   No insurance company is gonna go and create an insurance
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.120]   entity and offer them insurance
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.800]   because the levels of fraud
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.760]   and the ability to resolve that fraud through courts
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.400]   would just not exist.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:34.280]   So now these people have to wait for decades
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   to have this very basic form of financial protection
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.660]   or something like a bank account even.
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.120]   And with this technology, they don't, right?
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.680]   So with this technology, if I have a $50 Android phone
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.960]   and the smart contract has data from satellites
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.320]   or weather stations about the weather conditions
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.600]   in the geography that my farm is in,
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.400]   I can put value into the smart contract
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:00.800]   and the smart contract will automatically pay me out,
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.800]   pay me back out at my Android phone.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.200]   And guess what?
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.760]   I just leapfrogged past my corrupt government
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:10.880]   not being able to provide a legal infrastructure
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.360]   to create insurance.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.160]   I just leapfrogged past dealing with insurance companies
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.600]   that will probably price gouge me and often not pay out.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:23.560]   And I leapfrogged into the world of hyper-reliable
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.600]   kind of guaranteed smart contract outcomes
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.520]   that are as good or in many cases better
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.480]   than what farmers in all parts of other parts
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.760]   of the world have.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.200]   And this type of dynamic for the emerging markets
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.240]   of creating a way for people to control
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.320]   and manage risk in their economic life,
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.240]   I think extends way past insurance.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.840]   It extends to them having bank accounts
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.400]   to combat local inflation.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.720]   It extends to them being able to sell their goods
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.540]   on the global free market of global trade
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:49.680]   without middlemen.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.360]   It extends to all these things
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.160]   that we don't really care about, right?
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.900]   Because we're not farmers,
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.960]   but are unbelievably impactful for people
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.520]   that don't have a bank account
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.380]   and their inflation rate in their country is double digits
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.080]   or their farm completely depends on rain
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.840]   or their livelihood completely depends
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.160]   on their ability to sell goods.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.400]   And they can't sell those goods
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.760]   because there's a middleman
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:16.200]   who essentially controls all the trust relationships.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.660]   But now we have the internet and smart contracts
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.860]   and that might not have to be the case
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.500]   in the next five or 10 years.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.580]   - Yeah, so that definitely has a quality of life impact
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.060]   on the particular farmer's life,
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:30.200]   but I suspect it has a huge,
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.940]   like down the line ripple effect on the whole supply chain.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:36.180]   So if you think about farmers,
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:41.180]   but any other people that produce things
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:46.220]   that are part of a large logistics network,
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:48.960]   like a supply chain network,
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.600]   that means when you increase reliability,
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:57.600]   you sort of increase transparency and control,
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.920]   but like where any one node in that supply chain network
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:06.320]   can formalize the way it operates
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.680]   in its agreements with others,
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:13.680]   you could just have a very like at scale
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:18.900]   transformative effect on how people that down the line
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.940]   use the services that you provide,
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.280]   the products that you create operate.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.740]   So like, it's almost hard to imagine
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:30.580]   the possible ways it might transform the world.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.220]   I wonder how much friction there is in the system,
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:37.580]   I guess, currently that smart contracts might remove.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.720]   That's almost unknown.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.480]   You can sort of hypothesize and stuff, but I wonder.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.880]   I've seen enough bureaucracy in my life
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.440]   to know that smart contracts in many cases
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.620]   would remove bureaucracy.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.620]   And I wonder how the world will be
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.360]   once you remove much of the bureaucracy.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.160]   Coming from the Soviet Union,
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:05.160]   where I just have seen the life sucked out
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:10.720]   of the innovative spirit of human nature by bureaucracy.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:14.160]   I wonder, the kind of amazing world
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.660]   that could be created once bureaucracy is removed.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:22.320]   - Yeah, I think it's fascinating how the world can evolve.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.280]   I think this extends a lot further than people think
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.040]   into many, many different parts of the global economy.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.920]   It might start with NFTs for art,
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.280]   or it might start with DeFi, right?
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.600]   Or it might start with fraud-proof ad networks next.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.320]   We don't know what it's going to go to next.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:42.440]   But I think the implication of people being
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:46.360]   in a system of contracts that holds them accountable
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.960]   and guarantees contractual outcomes,
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.240]   regardless of a local legal system,
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.960]   is something that I think extends to the supply chain.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:57.720]   You can prove that goods were sourced in an ethical way,
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.200]   and you can prove that in a way that can't be gamed.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.480]   That'll change buying power and supplier power
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:06.760]   and how people produce goods that we all consume.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.840]   And then on the political level,
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.760]   I personally think that in a number of decades,
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.840]   we could literally be in a place where politicians
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:18.700]   can commit to a certain set of smart contract
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.280]   kind of budget definitional kind of results.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.540]   For example, we discovered oil.
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.840]   I promise as a politician, I'm going to take the oil
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.200]   and I'm going to redistribute it to all of you.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.440]   Well, that's wonderful.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.640]   That's a great idea.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.240]   Sounds very nice when you're running for office.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.760]   Why don't we codify that in a smart contract?
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.760]   And why don't we put those conditions
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.680]   very solidly on a blockchain?
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.040]   And then once you've been elected,
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.760]   we'll just turn that one on,
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.880]   and it'll distribute the money just like you said,
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.520]   and everything will be fine.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.880]   I personally think that this new level of systems
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.160]   that allows trustworthy collaboration between everybody,
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.680]   between supply chain partners, ad network users,
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.080]   the financial system, insurance companies, and farmers,
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.480]   all of these are just interactions
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.520]   that require a trusted entity,
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.200]   or in this case, a trusted piece of code
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.440]   to orchestrate the interaction
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.480]   in the way that everyone agrees.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:20.200]   - Yeah, one of the things that makes the United States
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.080]   fascinating is the founding documents.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:26.000]   And it's fascinating to think of us moving into the new
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.240]   in the 21st century to a digital version of that.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:33.320]   So the constitution, a smart constitution,
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.320]   no offense to the paper constitution,
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.800]   but, and that would have transformative effects
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.160]   on politicians and governments,
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.640]   holding people accountable.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:50.560]   Oh man, that's so exciting to think that
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:57.080]   we might enforce accountability
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.960]   through the smart contract process.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.440]   - Exactly, why can't that happen?
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.720]   Anything that we could codify into a smart contract,
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.200]   and anything that we all agree
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.160]   is the way the world should work.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.320]   And then anything that we can get proof about, right?
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.840]   Anything that a system somewhere could tell us happened,
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.060]   those are the pieces of the puzzle, right?
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.120]   We need a trusted piece of code,
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.040]   we need to have agreement
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.580]   that that's how the world should work,
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.040]   and we need a system that'll tell
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.480]   that trusted piece of code what happened.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.760]   As long as we have those three things,
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.040]   we can theoretically codify any set of agreements
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:39.040]   about anything where those three properties take hold.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.920]   - I wonder if you could apply that
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.800]   to like military conflict and so on.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:48.080]   Recently, Biden announced that we're going to pull off
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:52.480]   from Afghanistan after 20 years in the war.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:56.200]   I wonder, there's a lot of debacles
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.880]   around war in Afghanistan and invasion of Iraq,
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.000]   all those kinds of things.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.700]   I wonder if that was instead formulated as a smart contract.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:11.000]   Like that might have actually huge impact
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.640]   on the way we do conflict.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.360]   So you think of a smart contract
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.040]   as a kind of win-win situation,
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.040]   where you're doing like financial transactions
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.560]   or something like that.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:25.360]   But you could see that also about military conflict
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:30.080]   or like whenever two nations are at tension with each other,
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.040]   different scales of conflict,
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.260]   that you could have conflict codified.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:40.960]   And that would potentially resolve conflict much faster
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.840]   because there's honesty, transparency,
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.200]   and control within that conflict.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.240]   'Cause there's conflict in this world.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.760]   And again, very, very inspiring to think about
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.920]   the kind of effects it might have
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.400]   on the negative kinds of contracts,
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.600]   on the tense, painful kinds of contracts.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.280]   - I haven't thought about that as much
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.240]   as actually kind of scary,
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.040]   the stuff you're thinking through now
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.080]   with like the war contracts or something.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.400]   You know, that's not in the white paper.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.640]   We don't have anything about war contracts or anything.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.560]   - Again, this is the Russian, we're both Russian,
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.320]   but I'm a little more Russian in the suffering side.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.240]   Maybe I read way too much Dostoevsky
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.400]   and military kind of ideas.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   But anyway, holding politicians accountable in all forms,
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.200]   I think is really powerful.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:29.200]   Is there something you could say as a small aside
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:32.760]   on how smart contracts actually work?
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.600]   If we look at the code,
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:37.160]   is there some nice way to say technically,
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.020]   what is a smart contract?
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.640]   What does it mean to codify these agreements,
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.920]   the actual process for people
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.560]   who might not at all be familiar?
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.640]   - I think you just write it into code
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:52.560]   that operates in this kind of decentralized infrastructure.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.160]   You usually write code
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.160]   that runs in a central server somewhere.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:58.160]   Now you write code that runs
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.640]   across a lot of different machines
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.440]   in this decentralized way.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.440]   And then after you write it, you need services.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.560]   And that's where Oracles come in.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.200]   They provide all the services.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.360]   So just like you would be writing code in Web 2.0 land,
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.800]   running it on a server somewhere and using an API,
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.880]   here you'd be writing code,
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.640]   putting it on a decentralized infrastructure
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.120]   like a blockchain or a smart contract platform like Ethereum.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.640]   And then you would be using various services
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.620]   in the form of Oracle.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.960]   So they'll just be called Oracles
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.400]   or decentralized services instead of APIs.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.120]   And you're basically composing the same type of architecture,
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.120]   except it's hyper reliable.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.760]   At the moment, it's a little bit less efficient
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.160]   because there's an early stage to our industry.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.200]   But it provides this extreme level of reliability
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.240]   and transparency, which for certain use cases
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.720]   is an absolute critical component
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.840]   and is completely reinventing how they work.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.920]   So I think people should look at what are the use cases
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.520]   where that trust dynamic can be so heavily improved.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.720]   And that's probably the ones
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.560]   where this is maybe initially useful.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.680]   - But I mean, just to emphasize,
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.360]   I don't think people realize when you say code
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:09.360]   that we're talking about non-obfuscated actual program.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.960]   You can read it, you can understand it.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.120]   And there's something about,
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.320]   maybe this is my computer science perspective
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.640]   of like software engineering perspective,
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.320]   but there's something about the formalism
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   of programming languages, which enforces simplicity,
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.040]   clarity and transparency.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.960]   And because it's seen to everybody,
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.080]   I mean, simplicity is enforced.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.600]   There's something about natural language,
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.780]   like language as written in the constitution, for example,
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.220]   where there's so many interpretations.
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:46.960]   With the nice thing about programs,
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.120]   there's not going to be a huge number of books written
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.160]   about what was meant by this particular line
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.560]   'cause it's pretty clear.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.880]   Like programming languages have a clarity to them
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.480]   that natural language does not,
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.420]   and they don't have ambiguity.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.740]   Which I think it's important to pause on
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.260]   'cause it's really powerful.
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.900]   It's really difficult to think about.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.340]   I think we live in a world where all the philosophers
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.340]   and legal minds don't know how to program.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.620]   So I think, not all, most don't.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:22.820]   And so we don't often see the philosophical impact
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:26.580]   of this kind of idea that the agreements between humans
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.020]   can be written in a programming language.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.760]   That's a really transformative idea.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.760]   That, I mean, yeah, it's an idea that's not just technical,
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.020]   it's not just financial, it's philosophical.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:44.420]   It's rethinking human nature from a digital perspective.
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.100]   Like what is human civilization?
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.800]   It's interaction between humans.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:55.860]   And rethinking that interaction as a digital interaction
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.100]   that is managed by programming languages,
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.000]   by programs, by code.
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.320]   I mean, that's fascinating.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.760]   That we'll look back at this time potentially
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.120]   as one where us little descendants of apes
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:15.120]   did not realize how important this moment in history is.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.560]   Like human beings might be totally different
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:23.640]   a century from now because we codified
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.840]   the interaction between humans.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.440]   That might have more of an impact
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.360]   than anything else we do today.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.780]   You think about the impact of the internet,
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.020]   one of the cool things is digitization of data.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:38.100]   But we have not yet integrated the tools,
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:42.340]   the mechanisms fully that use that data
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.860]   and interact with humans yet.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.840]   And that's what smart contracts do.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.620]   I wonder if you think about the role
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:50.180]   of artificial intelligence in all of this.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.940]   Because your smart contracts are kind of agreements,
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:57.620]   maybe you disagree with this,
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.860]   but at least the way I'm thinking about it
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:03.060]   is agreements between humans or groups of humans.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:07.220]   But it seems like because everything's operating
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:10.620]   in the digital space that you can integrate
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.960]   non-humans into this.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.580]   Or AI systems that help out humans, managed by humans.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.980]   Like what do you think about a world
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:23.120]   of hybrid smart contracts,
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:30.500]   codifying agreements between hybrid
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:34.720]   intelligent being networks of humans and AI systems?
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:39.080]   - Yeah, yeah, I think that makes perfect sense.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:42.300]   In terms of AI, I'm not an expert, right?
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.300]   So it might be a bit simplistic or naive,
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.380]   my ideas in this field.
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:51.720]   I think everyone saw the Terminator movie, right?
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.980]   Everybody kind of saw the Terminator movie in the '90s.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:57.500]   And it was like, this is really scary.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.020]   I personally think AI is amazing.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.140]   It makes perfect sense.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:06.380]   I think it will evolve to a place where people have...
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.460]   Just to understand, I work in the world of trust issues.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.940]   I work in the world of how can technology solve trust
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:16.040]   and collaboration issues using encryption,
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.260]   using cryptographically guaranteed systems,
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:20.020]   using decentralized infrastructure, right?
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.220]   So that's the world that I've been inhabiting
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.780]   for many, many years now,
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.460]   building smart contracts for seven or eight,
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:27.480]   doing stuff before that.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.320]   It's kind of what I'm focused on.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.900]   So I view AI through that same lens.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.260]   And my brain naturally asks,
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:37.860]   well, what is the trust issue that people might have with AI?
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.580]   And my natural kind of response is,
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:44.820]   well, let's say AI continues to be built and improve.
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:47.980]   At some point, I have no clue where we are on this now.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:51.020]   I've seen different ideas that were very far from this.
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.820]   I've seen other ideas were very close to this.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:55.460]   At a certain point, we'd arrive at a place with AI
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.840]   where we would be a little bit worried
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.600]   about just how much it could do, right?
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.180]   We might be worried that AI could do things
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.240]   we don't want it to do,
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.300]   but we still want to give AI
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:08.580]   a level of control over our lives, right?
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.660]   So in my world, that's a trust issue.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.140]   And the way that that trust issue
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:14.980]   would be solved with blockchains
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.820]   is actually very straightforward.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:19.780]   And I think in its simplicity, quite powerful.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:23.420]   You could have an AI that has an ability to do
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:28.420]   and control key parts of your and our lives, right?
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:32.060]   But then you could limit it with private keys
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:35.800]   and blockchains and create certain guardrails
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.800]   and firm kind of walls and limits
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:44.260]   to what the AI could never go past,
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.960]   assuming that encryption, right?
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.000]   That encryption continues to work, right?
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.060]   And assuming that if it's not that AI's specialization
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.180]   to break encryption, that it wouldn't be able to do that.
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:59.220]   So if you have an AI that controls
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.460]   something very important, whatever it is,
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.560]   shipping or something in defense
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.380]   or something in the financial system, whatever it is,
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:09.060]   but you're sitting there and you're kind of worried,
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.540]   hey, this thing is unbelievable.
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.060]   It's coming up with things
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.980]   we wouldn't have thought of in a hundred years,
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.900]   but maybe it's a little too unbelievable.
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.680]   How do you limit it?
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.720]   Well, if you bake in private keys
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.020]   and you bake in these kind of blockchain based limitations,
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.940]   you can create the conditions
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:31.640]   beyond which an AI could never act.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.500]   And those could once again be codified
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.700]   in the very specific unambiguous terms
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.040]   in which you described,
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:41.660]   which once again, in my trust issue focused world
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:45.020]   would solve the trust issue for users
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.860]   and make them comfortable with using the AI
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.780]   or ceding control to the AI,
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:53.860]   which I think in more advanced versions of AI
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.860]   will continue to be a concern, right?
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.100]   - This is fascinating.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.260]   So smart contracts actually provide a mechanism
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.600]   for human supervision of AI systems.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.580]   - With encryption, very encryption heavy.
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.320]   So it's not about like, is it smarter than us?
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.860]   It's about, will the encryption hold up?
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:10.780]   - Yep.
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:15.060]   So that's based on the assumption that encryption holds up.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.340]   I think that's a safe assumption
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.100]   we can get into that whole discussion,
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.940]   but from quantum computing,
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.020]   but cracking encryption is very difficult.
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.700]   That's a whole nother discussion.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.660]   I think we're on the safe ground for quite a long time
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.160]   assuming encryption holds.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:36.820]   There's a space that is at the cutting edge
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:41.380]   of general intelligence research in the AI community,
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:44.620]   which is the space of program synthesis
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:47.300]   or AI generating programs.
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:50.220]   So that's different than what you're referring to
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:54.720]   is AI being able to generate smart contracts.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.060]   And that to me is kind of fascinating
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:05.340]   to think of especially two AI systems between each other
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.020]   generating contracts,
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:10.740]   sort of almost creating a world
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:15.460]   where most of the contracts are between non-human beings.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.820]   - I think an AI system, as I think about it,
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.340]   and once again, this is not my field.
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.340]   This is something I might watch a YouTube video on
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:24.040]   or just see something interesting about at some point.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.400]   I think if I were to just reason through it, even now,
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.980]   I think the highly deterministic
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:34.420]   and guaranteed nature of smart contracts
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.940]   would probably be preferable to an AI
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:41.860]   because I'm guessing an AI would have a lot of problems
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:43.780]   with dealing with the human element
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:45.660]   of how contracts work today.
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.380]   So an AI, for example,
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:52.060]   couldn't pick up the phone and call Dave at a bank
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.860]   to do a derivative and kind of discuss with Dave
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.340]   and have a call with him and kind of have a conversation
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:00.380]   and get him comfortable and tell him it's gonna be fine
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:03.680]   and kind of smooth out all the weird social cues
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.260]   that have to do with making certain derivatives.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:09.980]   I'm assuming that that's a pretty complicated
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.260]   neural map AI kind of problem.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:17.320]   Yeah, so if I think about it,
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.340]   the deterministic guaranteed nature of smart contracts
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:25.180]   probably would, and assuming they're accessible to AIs,
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:28.620]   could actually, interestingly enough, be the format
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:32.420]   that they prefer to codify their relationship
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:37.420]   with non-AI systems and very possibly other AI systems
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:42.700]   because it is very, I mean, it's pretty guaranteed, right?
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:46.740]   All the other types of contracts that an AI
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:49.780]   could go out there and seek to do
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:55.660]   would require some language processing around the law.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:59.540]   And I think, I don't know if this is a term,
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.700]   but probably not, a smart AI or a good AI
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.660]   or whatever the term is for a high-quality AI
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:08.100]   would probably realize some of the limitations
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:09.260]   and the risks.
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.060]   - Yeah, yeah, AI definitely dislikes ambiguity
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:15.740]   and would prefer the deterministic nature
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:17.540]   of smart contracts.
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.700]   I do wonder about this particular problem
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.340]   and maybe you could speak to it
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:26.340]   of how smart contracts can take over certain industries
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.400]   in a sense or how certain industries can convert
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.180]   their sets of agreements into smart contracts,
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.380]   which is, you mentioned sort of talking to Dave
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:39.940]   from the bank, you know, many of our laws,
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:43.300]   many of our agreements are currently
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:46.900]   through natural language, through words.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.340]   And so there is a process of mapping that has to occur
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:53.820]   in order to convert the legal agreements,
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:58.300]   legal contracts of today to smart contracts
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.080]   that by the way, AI may be able to help with.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.840]   But by way of question,
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:08.160]   how do you think we convert the legal contracts
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.040]   on which many industries currently function today
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.560]   or not even legal contracts,
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.000]   but ambiguous kind of agreements,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.840]   maybe they're loose sometimes,
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.480]   into more formal deterministic agreements
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.940]   that are represented by smart contracts?
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:29.420]   - So I think there's two, maybe two sides to this.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.980]   I think the first one is actually not a huge problem
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.120]   where you have things like the,
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.000]   it's the master agreement for derivatives
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.620]   or you have these agreements
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:41.100]   that basically already reference a system somewhere, right?
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.260]   Like for example, many legal agreements
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.060]   already accept e-signature.
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:45.900]   And so they're saying,
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.060]   hey, I'm gonna use this computing system over here
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.140]   around signatures and I'm gonna consider,
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.340]   and there's laws around that.
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.220]   And there's clauses that say e-signature
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.140]   is good enough for this agreement.
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.300]   I actually don't think this is a big problem
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.820]   for the vast majority of legal agreements
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:02.080]   that use systems already, right?
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.500]   So what you'll do is you'll swap out one repository
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:09.180]   or one set of system of contract settlement.
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.020]   And you'll just say, hey,
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.540]   this blockchain system over here
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.580]   is my new system of contract settlement.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:16.860]   Whatever it says is the state of the agreement
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.220]   instead of the centralized system over there, right?
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.320]   And so there's actually a huge amount of agreements
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.900]   that are already able to do that.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.740]   And I think we'll do that.
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.900]   I think there's another side to your question,
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:33.900]   which is the amount of agreements that are very ambiguous
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.140]   that can be turned into smart contracts.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:39.300]   And I think the limitation there is twofold.
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.780]   First of all, like you said earlier,
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:44.140]   the highly reliable smart contract
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:45.900]   and the lack of opaqueness
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.860]   and the clarity of smart contracts
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.700]   is very high and very powerful and very clear.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.840]   And it's, in my opinion,
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:58.400]   going to be much, much easier to take a smart contract
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.720]   and turn it into a set of natural language explanations
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.680]   and just say, hey, this is what this does, right?
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.320]   So I think that many contracts are,
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.040]   and even now in decentralized finance and DeFi
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.060]   and in decentralized insurance,
[01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:14.880]   they're basically being rebuilt in this format.
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.240]   And that rebuilding will make them clearer, like you said,
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.280]   and then restating those in natural language
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.120]   and explaining to people,
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.800]   well, you know, whether there's this,
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.400]   I think it'll actually be a lot simpler
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.080]   to explain to people what the contract is about.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.240]   - That's fascinating.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.240]   Mapping smart contracts into natural language,
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.280]   I didn't even think about that.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.440]   So that's, you're saying that's doable
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.980]   and natural and easy to do.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:37.400]   - Because there's so much clear, right?
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.080]   There's that forced clarity that you talked about.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.860]   I think the second aspect of this problem
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.680]   is the nuance around what contracts
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.700]   can be made unambiguous.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.320]   And I think that comes down to,
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.000]   often comes down to proving what happened,
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.280]   which is where Oracle networks
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.600]   and decentralized Oracle networks
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.120]   and Chainlink would come in.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.760]   And our experience there is quite extensive
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.120]   over the many years that we've worked
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.360]   on many different contract types.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.600]   I think what it fundamentally comes down to
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.680]   is whether there is data.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.560]   So we're not gonna be able to make a hybrid smart contract
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.280]   about whether somebody painted your house
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.080]   the right color blue.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.380]   We're just not gonna be doing that
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.480]   because there's no data feed that tells us
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.760]   that your house was painted blue
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.440]   or that it was the right color of blue.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.160]   Unless somebody sets up a drone
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.200]   with a color analysis tool and they generate that data.
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.960]   - Which by the way, it could be possible, right?
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.240]   There could be, if there's enough demand
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.800]   then the service would be created
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.500]   that has drones flying around
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.040]   that's telling you about the colors of,
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:38.920]   all those kinds of stuff.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.560]   So if there's actual demand that that will be created
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.640]   and because there'll be value to connect that data feed
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.360]   to the smart contracts and so on.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.660]   - I think you have it unbelievably right
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:51.060]   because there are already insurance companies
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:54.380]   that use drones to monitor construction sites from overhead
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.140]   and see how many people are wearing hard hats.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:59.100]   And if the percentage of people wearing hard hats
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:02.700]   isn't sufficiently high, then the policy is voided.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.260]   And so in that case, there is a data source
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.660]   and that data source can be put
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:08.340]   into a hybrid smart contract.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.020]   So the limitation of hybrid smart contracts is,
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.820]   is there a data source or a set of data sources
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.640]   to create definitive truth,
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.940]   to settle the contract and eliminate ambiguity.
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.520]   And then as you said, I think as people realize
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.800]   that smart contracts are a format
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.580]   in which they can form agreement
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.300]   about things like that insurance product around,
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.200]   how many people are wearing hard hats.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.220]   If I'm the construction site owner,
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:35.660]   well, I would really like a guarantee
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.020]   that your insurance policy is gonna pay me out
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.780]   if everyone is wearing hard hats.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:44.580]   And in that case, there is demand for the data
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:46.540]   and people will generate the data.
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.500]   And I actually think the insurance industry
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.120]   is interestingly a precursor of this
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.680]   because they're so data driven.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.080]   You already see insurance companies paying IOT companies
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:59.120]   to put data into their customer's infrastructure
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.360]   at the cost of the insurance company
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.880]   to generate the data that the insurance company uses
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.820]   to make a policy for the customer.
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:08.280]   So you basically already have people
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.240]   who really want to price data into their agreements
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.220]   when they're of sufficiently high value
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:17.240]   paying for their own customers
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:20.640]   to get data sensors into their infrastructure.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.680]   And I think as smart contracts
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.540]   become more of a requested format
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.280]   or data driven contracts become more of a format,
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.200]   there will be a growing demand
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.720]   about proving what happened through data.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.880]   - So it'd be motivating totally new data fees being created.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.280]   By the way, the insurance industry broadly,
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.840]   the revolutions there will be huge.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.780]   I've worked quite a bit with autonomous vehicles,
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.780]   semi-autonomous and just vehicles in general.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.780]   The insurance industry there, by the way,
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.620]   makes a huge amount of money,
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.520]   but is using very crappy data fees.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:18:01.180]   Revolutionizing how, like not by crappy, I mean very crude.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:06.340]   Like literally the insurance is based on things like age,
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:09.140]   gen, like basic demographic information
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:13.380]   as opposed to really high resolution information
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.320]   about you as an individual,
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.200]   which you may or may not want to provide.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.360]   So you can choose from an individual perspective
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.420]   to provide a data feed.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:26.420]   And there, like the power of insurance
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:35.420]   to enable the individual, to empower the individual
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.380]   could be huge because ultimately smart contracts
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.220]   motivate the use of data, the creation of new data feeds,
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:47.220]   but leveraging the whatever service it provides in truth
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:52.740]   as opposed to some kind of very loose notion of who you are.
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:57.220]   So that, again, not sure how that would change things,
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:02.220]   but in terms of the fundamental experience of life,
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.100]   'cause I think we all rely on insurance,
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:06.200]   not just in business, but in life.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.660]   And grounding that insurance in more and more
[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:13.340]   accurate representation of reality
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:15.940]   might just have transformative effects on society.
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.860]   - Well, just to mention one quick thing that you said,
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:20.580]   where I noticed another trust issue,
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:23.060]   you said the user might not want to share their data.
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:23.900]   - Yes.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.140]   - So what you could actually do,
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.980]   and what we've already worked on is
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:30.220]   you can have a smart contract that holds the data
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.900]   and evaluates the data of the user
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.540]   without sharing it with the insurance company.
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:38.100]   And the insurance company knows that the smart contract
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.380]   will evaluate it according to the policy,
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:41.900]   so they don't need the data.
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.300]   And the user can provide the data
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:47.220]   knowing it'll never touch the insurance company
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:49.900]   because it's only provided to the smart contract.
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:52.500]   And suddenly you've solved another trust issue
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.580]   because the autonomous piece of code
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:58.300]   can evaluate information separately from the interests
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:00.380]   of both of the counterparties.
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.080]   And so this is the recurring theme.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.620]   I think you're seeing this recurring theme
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:05.320]   where there's a trust issue,
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.880]   people can't use a system, they can't collaborate,
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.320]   they can't share information
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.280]   that would make a better agreement for both of them,
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.680]   they can't solve a risk in their daily life,
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.300]   they can't participate in a market,
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:17.580]   they can't have a bank account
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:18.660]   'cause nobody will give it to them
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.040]   'cause they can't give it to them in that legal system.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:25.380]   And once you have an autonomous piece of code
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.980]   that can also know what's going on,
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:30.620]   thanks to Oracle Networks and that combination of the code
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:33.320]   and the Oracle Network for the hybrid smart contract,
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.460]   the same pattern just recurs.
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:38.200]   It's really the same pattern.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.720]   And this is why I keep saying trust issues.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:43.080]   It's because I basically,
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.780]   almost every contractual trust issue that I see
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.620]   where there is a piece of data to prove
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.740]   and settle the trust issue
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.620]   in a way that works for both parties,
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:55.840]   there is no reason not to use an autonomous,
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.600]   highly reliable contract and piece of code.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.240]   And I have to tell you,
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.080]   I've seen this in a lot of different industries.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.120]   I've seen it insurance, ad networks,
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.200]   global finance, global trade.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.680]   Those are all multi-trillion dollar industries.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:14.040]   And then there are other smaller industries.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.240]   Like even one of the first smart contracts
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.780]   we worked on many years ago
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:20.660]   was for search engine optimization firms,
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:21.640]   where they would tell you,
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:24.120]   "Hey, I'm gonna raise your search engine ranking.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.520]   "Give me the money."
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.920]   And people wouldn't wanna give them the money
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:29.760]   because they never knew if they were gonna do it.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.840]   And then the search engine firm
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:31.720]   doesn't wanna do any work
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.600]   thinking they'll never get any money.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.200]   So we just initially even came up with a system
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.960]   where you could put Bitcoin into a smart contract
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.440]   and it would be released
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.520]   based on whether the search rank of a website
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.280]   got to a certain level on Google for a certain keyword.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.140]   And so the trust problem was solved.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:50.760]   But it's just the same story.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.560]   It's kind of like trust issues around AI,
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.220]   trust issues around financial products,
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:55.480]   trust issues around insurance,
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.960]   trust issues around social media, whatever it is.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.960]   I think that's what people looking at this industry
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.160]   really need to understand.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.200]   And once they do understand,
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.440]   they realize what this is all about.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:14.240]   This is about redefining how everyone collaborates
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.360]   with everyone about everything
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.000]   where we can prove something through data.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.520]   - You've mentioned confidentiality and privacy
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:26.200]   that the parties don't need to necessarily know
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.360]   private data in this interaction.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.360]   You talk about confidentiality in the white paper
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:33.960]   for Chainlink 2.0.
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:38.080]   Can you talk more about how to achieve confidentiality
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.000]   in this process?
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.740]   - Sure, sure, absolutely.
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:45.560]   So I think you once again need to think of the contract
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.020]   as existing in two parts, right?
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:48.320]   You have the on-chain code
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.860]   and then you have this off-chain system
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:51.800]   called the centralized Oracle network.
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:56.720]   So the question is really what portion of the contract
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.680]   should live in what part of these two systems, right?
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.720]   So if you want to create transparency,
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.960]   you should put more information on-chain
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.240]   because that's what blockchains are very good at.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.220]   - They're public, transparent,
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:15.000]   but they don't necessarily have privacy.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.680]   - Well, you can see how those two things
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.520]   are a little bit kind of completely
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.480]   diametrically opposed, right?
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.360]   So I do think, and I do see blockchains working
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.800]   on on-chain encrypted smart contracts.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.960]   That's very inefficient.
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:32.640]   It has a lot of nuances around it.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.040]   That I think will appear at some point.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.320]   I think until it appears,
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:41.580]   you have an option of taking a part of the computation
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:44.800]   and putting it into the centralized Oracle network.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.160]   We actually did an entire paper about this
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.200]   that we presented at Stanford in February of last year,
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.420]   something called Mixicles,
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:55.620]   which basically talks about how you can take
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:58.360]   an Oracle network and you can put a portion
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:01.040]   of the computation into the Oracle network,
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.120]   assuming that you're comfortable with that limited set
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.020]   of nodes, knowing what the computation is.
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:09.720]   And you could actually provide additional confidentiality
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.040]   through special hard work
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.860]   called trusted execution environments
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:15.280]   that all those nodes are forced to run.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.860]   So they won't even know what they're operating.
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.580]   And so at the end of the day,
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:22.120]   if you look at a hybrid smart contract
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.640]   as gaining functionality from its on-chain code
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.440]   and gaining other functionality from its off-chain,
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.480]   the centralized Oracle network component,
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.800]   you can place the part of the computation
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.560]   that you would like to be private
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.240]   in the decentralized Oracle network
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.760]   because you can control the set of nodes.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:42.780]   You can control the committee of nodes
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:46.080]   and you can require that they run certain hardware
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.960]   to keep the information private.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.720]   So you could basically make a derivative that,
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.560]   or a binary option is the example used
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.200]   in the Mexico's paper where the payout happened on-chain,
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.680]   but it was actually impossible to tell
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.400]   what the outcome of the contract was.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.840]   So the outcome of the contract was computed
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.560]   in the centralized Oracle network.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.680]   And then there was a switch that triggered
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.440]   who received the payment,
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.760]   but from the point of view of analyzing
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:18.760]   the on-chain transactions and seeing who received
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.400]   the payment or what the outcome of the contract was,
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.960]   you couldn't derive that,
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.320]   you couldn't backward engineer what that was,
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.120]   but the users of that hybrid smart contract
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.520]   still had on-chain code that guaranteed them
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.040]   that as long as the decentralized Oracle network
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.840]   found a certain outcome,
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.480]   determined a certain outcome,
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.020]   that the relevant user would get paid
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:44.540]   and there was still a place to put value.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:49.300]   So there is this kind of fundamental tension
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:52.340]   between confidentiality, privacy,
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:54.180]   which is very important for many contracts,
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:56.100]   which is critical to many contracts
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:59.500]   and the public and transparent nature of blockchains,
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.860]   which I think eventually will be solved
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.660]   through encrypted on-chain smart contracts.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.860]   That'll take some time,
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.180]   I think that'll take years in my opinion.
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:10.940]   And before we arrive there,
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.060]   I think people will put the private portion
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:15.260]   into the centralized Oracle network.
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.700]   Once again, going back to what
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.060]   the decentralized Oracle networks do,
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:21.620]   they seek to provide these services, right?
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.340]   So the ability to do a privacy preserving computation
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.140]   is perhaps a service without which
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:31.460]   a certain type of contract might never come into existence
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.540]   in the form of an on-chain hybrid smart contract.
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:35.860]   And so this is once again,
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:38.220]   what we see the centralized Oracle networks
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:40.020]   and decentralized services doing
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:43.020]   is providing people these tools and building blocks
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:46.740]   to compose, like I'm great at making
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:47.980]   these derivatives contracts,
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:49.340]   but I can't make them
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:52.180]   unless I can retain the privacy of them.
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:56.060]   And our goal is to provide the infrastructure
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.660]   that gives you as a developer
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:00.900]   and as a creator of smart contracts, that capability.
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:03.620]   And what we've seen is that as we provide that capability,
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:04.900]   people create more,
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.220]   which is also really the story of the internet, right?
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:08.700]   The story of the internet is,
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:10.980]   it was really tough to do e-commerce
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:13.180]   while everything was in HTTP
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:15.740]   and credit cards were transmitted publicly.
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.180]   And so e-commerce was kind of tough
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:18.820]   'cause how am I gonna send my credit card
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:21.340]   over public unencrypted channels, right?
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:23.260]   But the second HTTPS appears,
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.900]   e-commerce becomes a lot easier
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.900]   because I can put in my credit card number
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:29.060]   and it can be sent over an encrypted channel
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.460]   and it's not at risk.
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:31.980]   And so I can participate in e-commerce
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.660]   as long as I have a credit card.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:34.940]   I think those types,
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:37.020]   and I'm sure that was unexpected, right?
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:40.060]   I'm sure at the time that was an unexpected outcome
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:41.980]   from that technology.
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:43.900]   And so I think this is why
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:46.420]   we sometimes have this focus on privacy
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:48.540]   because in our work with contracts
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:51.740]   and their transition into this hybrid smart contract form,
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:55.740]   we see a substantial amount of need for privacy
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:59.820]   as an inherent property of these contracts.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.860]   - And it'll take a while before that's possible
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:04.100]   to create the kind of technology innovation
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.580]   required to do that on chain.
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.860]   I know there's a few ideas that are being floating about,
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:10.820]   but so the currently distributed Oracle networks
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:12.380]   provide that feature,
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:14.260]   which is essential to many contracts.
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:16.860]   What brings to mind in this whole space,
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:20.260]   again, it might be outside of your expertise,
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:23.500]   but within the world, which I'm passionate about,
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.140]   which is machine learning.
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:27.860]   And it seems like very naturally
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:31.260]   because current machine learning systems
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:33.340]   are very data hungry
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:37.900]   and much of the value mined by companies
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.420]   in the digital space are from data.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:44.900]   They often want their data to maintain privacy.
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:47.500]   So you think about an autonomous vehicle space,
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.500]   Tesla is collecting a huge amount of data,
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:53.180]   Waymo is collecting a huge amount of data.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.740]   It seems like it would be very beneficial
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:57.180]   to form contracts where one could use the data
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:00.700]   from the other in some kind of privacy preserving way,
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:05.700]   but also where all the uses of data are codified
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:08.540]   and you can exchange value cleanly,
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:10.700]   basically contracts over data,
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:15.700]   over machine learning systems use of different data.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:19.180]   I don't know, do you talk to machine learning folks
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:21.460]   that use ideas of smart contracts
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:23.300]   or is that from outside your interest?
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.460]   'Cause it seems like exceptionally applicable set of...
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.100]   When we talk about different services
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:33.300]   that might be created and revolutionized by smart,
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.180]   especially hybrid smart contracts,
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:40.100]   I think machine learning systems comes to mind to me
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:42.180]   in all industries.
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:43.460]   I don't know if you've gotten a chance
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.860]   to interact with those folks, with those services.
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:47.700]   - I think what you're talking about
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:49.100]   is more data marketplaces
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:51.700]   in the data marketplace side of things.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:55.340]   Well, this is actually once again, very applicable
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.820]   'cause there's a trust issue.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:58.500]   At the end of the day,
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.580]   let's say I'm trying to sell you some data.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:03.020]   You don't know the quality of the data,
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:04.700]   so you don't know what you wanna pay for it.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:07.060]   And I can't give you the data for you to determine
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.860]   the quality 'cause I've given you the data.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:10.700]   Guess what?
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:13.700]   We need an autonomous impartial agent.
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:17.140]   We need an impartial computational kind of agent
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:20.940]   and on-chain smart contract with an Oracle network
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:25.540]   to assess my data, to basically take
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:28.340]   random cross-section samples of the data,
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:31.940]   assess it for quality, assess it for signal
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:33.580]   from the algorithm you have,
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:35.220]   which you don't wanna share with me
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:36.420]   'cause you don't wanna know the algorithm
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.740]   you're working on, right?
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:40.860]   You don't want me to know what you want the data for.
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:44.140]   So now the autonomous agent takes your algorithm,
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:46.020]   keeping it private from me and takes my data,
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:47.700]   keeping it private from you,
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:50.700]   assesses it on a random cross-section sampling
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:54.700]   for quality of data, returns the scoring back to you,
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:57.460]   allows you to determine a price.
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:00.380]   And now both you and me know that we've arrived
[01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:03.700]   at a fair price for the quality of my data
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.620]   for what you wanna do with it.
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:10.060]   And that's once again, from what I've seen
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:13.940]   in the data marketplaces, which are full of people
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.780]   who want that data for these learning models,
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:20.220]   often for financial markets, often for other reasons,
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:24.460]   this is their fundamental problem, which amazingly enough,
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:28.060]   there's a trust issue that is getting solved.
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:31.140]   And I think you can see even on the face of it,
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:33.620]   once that trust issue is solved,
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:36.660]   those markets can work a lot better, right?
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:37.980]   I don't need to know your algorithm,
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:39.540]   you don't need to know my data.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.900]   We both know that the autonomous agent
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:43.660]   is not under either of our control
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:46.340]   and gave us a fair assessment and a fair price.
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:47.940]   And that's it.
[01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:50.940]   And we're all very comfortable with that.
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:53.980]   I could even make conditions that your algorithm
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:55.780]   isn't analyzing the data for something
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:57.100]   I don't want you to analyze it for,
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.820]   or you could make conditions that the data has to have
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.420]   any number of properties.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:05.100]   And once again, you haven't leaked any signal to me,
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.460]   and I haven't leaked any data to you,
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:11.260]   which is once again, just another type of trust issue
[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:12.260]   that all of this solves.
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.180]   So it's the same pattern.
[01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:15.820]   If you work in this industry long enough,
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:18.420]   or if you really look at these use cases long enough,
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:20.060]   you'll simply come to the question,
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:22.260]   and this is the useful question,
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.740]   what is the trust issue this is solving?
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:27.100]   And then if you can get an answer to that question
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:28.940]   on a case by case basis,
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:32.620]   that's when you'll understand why blockchains are relevant.
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:35.220]   And then once you do that with enough use cases,
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:38.620]   it becomes a little bit mind-blowing.
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:40.580]   - You've mentioned trust quite a bit.
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:45.860]   You also mentioned trust minimization
[01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:47.540]   in the Chainlink white paper.
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:51.540]   Can we dig into trust a little bit more?
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:53.820]   What is the nature of trust
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:56.140]   that you think about in these smart contracts?
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:58.180]   What is trust minimization?
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:01.140]   How do we accomplish, achieve trust minimization?
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.020]   - Sure, sure.
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:05.660]   I think it's important maybe to have a conception
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:07.460]   of what the alternative is, right?
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:11.620]   What is highly reliable, trust minimized off-chain
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:14.060]   and on-chain computation an alternative to?
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:16.980]   So this is just kind of how I see the world
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:18.940]   in these two camps.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:20.780]   One camp is the traditional,
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:25.260]   what I call brand-based or paper guarantee camp.
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:27.500]   And this is the world as pretty much most
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.100]   or all people know it today.
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.420]   This is the world where there's a bank logo
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:34.140]   or an insurance company logo or some kind of logo.
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:37.700]   There's a very big building with marble arches and columns.
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:39.460]   You know, it's the biggest building in the town.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:40.980]   It's bigger than the church.
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:42.380]   And everybody feels very good.
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:43.700]   Everybody's got such a nice logo.
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.220]   It's such a big building.
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:47.620]   Why don't I give them my money?
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:49.140]   Why don't I interact with them
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:51.780]   on the basis of any kind of agreement?
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:52.860]   And that's good.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:56.060]   And that is definitely better than that not being there.
[01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:57.940]   And that is definitely a huge improvement
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:00.260]   for how people conduct commerce,
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:04.100]   letters of credit from branded entities
[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:06.700]   are very important for global trade to take place
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:09.260]   in the early stages of global trade.
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:13.380]   So that's good, but it is fundamentally
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:16.740]   just a paper agreement with a legal framework behind it.
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:20.660]   And if the paper agreement you have would say Robinhood
[01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:24.860]   or somebody else suddenly has to change, well, it changes
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:26.500]   and you can't really do anything about it.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.260]   You won't be able to change anything
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:29.700]   about what happened there.
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.220]   There's some long-term service.
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:34.500]   There's some other agreements around all this stuff.
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:37.740]   At the end of the day, that's the brand-based
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:41.420]   and paper guarantee world where it's all very vague
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:44.060]   and opaque and you're kind of hoping for the best
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:45.620]   because there's a nice logo.
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.300]   It's been around 100 years, a lot of marble.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:49.300]   - Put a lot of marble.
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:50.780]   - Big building, lots of marbles.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:53.740]   This is why banks have such nice buildings.
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:56.020]   It's not because they wanna spend money on buildings.
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:59.980]   It's to create confidence in them as an entity
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:03.220]   in order for people to transact through them.
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:06.460]   This is why all these kind of go-to cities
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:10.020]   that had gold rushes, go-to cities that needed banking
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:12.580]   as a service in certain time periods,
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:14.060]   they're the most beautiful buildings,
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.940]   at least in the United States.
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:19.060]   So this is the brand-based paper guarantee model
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.500]   for which up until now,
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.060]   there has never been an alternative.
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:25.100]   So up until now, if you had a bad experience with a bank
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:28.340]   or insurance company or some logo somewhere,
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.340]   you would only have one option.
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:32.380]   Your option would be to go across the road
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:35.420]   and down the block to another building
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:39.300]   with another color of marble and another set of agreements
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:43.140]   that are fundamentally still paper brand agreements.
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:47.580]   Now, for the first time, you have mathematical agreements.
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:52.500]   You have mathematically guaranteed encryption-secured,
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:55.580]   decentralized infrastructure-powered agreements.
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:59.500]   This is really the shift.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:03.420]   This is really the comparison and the alternative
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:05.540]   through which people should view all of this, in my opinion,
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.940]   because there's once again this conception
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:11.060]   that everything is fine, everything works very well.
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:13.500]   Well, it does, it works fine and very well
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.140]   as long as nothing goes wrong.
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:17.500]   And then in the cases when things go wrong,
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:20.340]   which they pretty much invariably at some point do,
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:23.020]   then you find out that, well, turns out
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:25.220]   they don't have to pay me, or turns out I can't trade,
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:27.900]   or turns out the ATMs can be locked up
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:30.100]   and only give me 66 euros per day,
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:31.740]   whether I'm a business or an individual,
[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:35.060]   like what happened in Greece a few years ago, right?
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:40.060]   And the reality is that once that becomes strong enough
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:43.820]   kind of realization for people,
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:45.260]   I think they will all just migrate
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:47.460]   to mathematically guaranteed contracts,
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:49.500]   because why wouldn't you?
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:53.220]   So in the world of mathematically guaranteed contracts,
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:56.220]   kind of how do we, and cryptographically secured
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.940]   and decentralized infrastructure powered,
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:00.180]   how do we evolve into that world?
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:05.380]   Well, at the end of the day, it comes down to consensus.
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:09.580]   It comes down to a collection of independent nodes,
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:13.300]   a collection of provably independent computing systems
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:17.140]   arriving at the same conclusion impartially.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:22.100]   That conclusion might be the transaction is valid
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:25.260]   between address A and address B,
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:27.940]   address A has one Bitcoin, wants to send it to address B,
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.940]   and address B has one Bitcoin, right?
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:31.980]   So that's one degree of validation.
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:34.340]   It has certain cryptographic primitives that are used,
[01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:36.700]   certain levels of cryptography, encryption,
[01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:39.340]   and other methods that basically provide
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:42.500]   clarity and those guarantees.
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.660]   But fundamentally, it's this level of consensus
[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:48.100]   that multiple independent computing systems
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:51.260]   came to the same conclusion, verified that conclusion,
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:53.420]   and created a sense of finality,
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:56.860]   created a final state that is globally considered
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:59.500]   to be the state of a transaction.
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:03.820]   And that is how it's achieved, right?
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:06.660]   So it's achieved by users looking
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:11.580]   at these mathematical contract systems and saying,
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:13.660]   if I have money in a bank,
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:16.340]   there's one single person who controls that money,
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:18.620]   that's the bank, they could choose to give me my money
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:20.820]   or choose not to give me my money.
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:23.220]   And that's great, but maybe there's a percentage
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:26.180]   of what I own that I want to put into another system
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:29.100]   where there's thousands of independent computing systems
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:31.100]   that are promising me,
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.140]   with the help of cryptographic primitives,
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.540]   that I will be able to always have access to this.
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:41.060]   Whatever this is, whatever this token is,
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:43.460]   I will at least, or at the very least,
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:45.900]   I will always have unfettered,
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:48.220]   complete control and access to it.
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.380]   So that's one example.
[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:52.940]   Another example is, hey, we have a hybrid smart contract
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:55.100]   for something like crop insurance.
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:59.140]   I, as the user, evaluate where this smart contract runs.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:01.500]   Oh, wow, the smart contract runs on Ethereum.
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.540]   Great, thousands of nodes,
[01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:06.700]   lots of computational security,
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:08.540]   hash power, so on and so on.
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:10.860]   Then I look at, oh, well, what triggers the contract?
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:12.420]   Oh, there's this Oracle network.
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:15.460]   Okay, it's composed of 25 nodes or 15 nodes,
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:18.060]   gets data from five different weather stations.
[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:19.900]   You know, I'm comfortable with that.
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:21.460]   I have a certain level of comfort
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:23.140]   with that hybrid smart contract
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:26.700]   and its ability to provide me consensus
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:28.340]   about the transaction,
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:30.580]   once the contract knows what's happened,
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:33.100]   and I'm comfortable with the consensus
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:36.220]   around the event that controls the contract, right?
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:39.860]   Because once again, that event is what determines
[01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:41.420]   what happens with the contract.
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.900]   And if the contract is super well-written,
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:47.020]   it doesn't matter if the event isn't reliable, right?
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:48.580]   So now I've made this determination.
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:51.220]   I've gotten all this clear, transparent information
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:55.580]   about this system that combines the contract code
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:57.540]   with a decentralized Oracle network,
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.580]   and I've made my decision to participate
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:01.940]   in this decentralized insurance,
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:03.780]   kind of crop insurance policy.
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:06.540]   I've sent the Bitcoin or the stable coin
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:09.180]   or whatever I have on my Android phone.
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:12.340]   And then time goes by, and let's say it doesn't rain.
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:15.460]   Lo and behold, the smart contract returns
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:18.940]   the relevant amount from the policy back to me.
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:22.100]   I continue my life as a farmer.
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.980]   And by the way, the fact that that happened
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:28.300]   contributes reputation and contributes proof
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.860]   back to both the contract as something
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:34.260]   that can prove to other people that it has settled,
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:36.820]   and the Oracle network as something that can prove
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:39.460]   that it has properly assessed reality
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.660]   or properly triggered a contract.
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:44.300]   And this is where there's one of many network effects
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:47.620]   where the more that smart contracts
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:49.260]   and Oracle networks are used,
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:53.300]   they themselves generate this immutable on-chain data
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:57.820]   that proves their value and reliability.
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:00.540]   And in proving more and more of that
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:03.700]   in more and more kind of use cases
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:06.740]   and more and more variants of the same contract,
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:10.580]   they arrive at a greater body of proof that they,
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:12.860]   like I am the decentralized crop,
[01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:16.620]   the decentralized insurance contract for crop insurance
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.780]   used by a million users.
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:24.460]   And my failure rate is non-existent or really low.
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:25.620]   And here's my Oracle network.
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:28.740]   And by the way, it's also settled a million of these.
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:31.380]   And so it's not the logo, right?
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:35.460]   It's not, "Hey, what a nice logo you have
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:40.100]   on top of a building above a train terminal or something."
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:44.020]   It's much more, "Hey, there's a million people.
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:45.500]   There's a million separate contracts
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:46.700]   that got settled correctly.
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:50.340]   I have all the proof that I could ever need about that."
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:53.460]   And it's not something that's very easy to gain, right?
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:57.100]   Because real value was at stake, real value was moved around.
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.180]   And so I think once again,
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:00.820]   the transparency aspect comes in
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.580]   where you're able to prove
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:07.580]   that the cryptographically enforced contracts are better.
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:12.020]   - That said, you can still integrate the traditional banks
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:13.540]   as long as you create a data feed
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:16.940]   on the amount of marble that's included.
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:19.300]   So if that's valuable to you in terms of reputation,
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.740]   you could still integrate the marble,
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:25.740]   the amount of marble and the size of the logo.
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:28.580]   We could still keep the banks around.
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:29.420]   - I think we will.
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:30.820]   I think what'll happen with the banks
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:32.500]   and all the insurance companies, by the way,
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:34.860]   is not that they'll all just die or something.
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:36.420]   I think it'll be just like the internet.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:38.660]   There'll be some of them that adopt this
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:40.140]   and some of them that don't
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:41.340]   and some of them that do it faster,
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:42.820]   some of them that do it slower.
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:45.380]   And that's an economic decision that they'll make.
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:46.900]   I think their whole question is,
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:48.900]   "Is this a foregone conclusion?"
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.100]   I mean, I think my answer is yes,
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:52.980]   this is definitely gonna be happening.
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:55.020]   I think they still have a question of,
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:58.580]   "Is this gonna change my industry?"
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:03.460]   But I'm seeing a definite shift in people's understanding.
[01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:06.100]   And I think that shift is gonna accelerate rapidly
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:09.660]   as one or two of their competitors throw their hat
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:12.060]   in the smart contract ring and say,
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:14.500]   "Well, I have smart contracts.
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.260]   "I guarantee my outcomes to you.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:18.500]   "What do they do for you?
[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:22.020]   "It's risky, just use mine."
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:24.260]   And the second some of them start losing business
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:27.700]   because of that, they're gonna move very quickly
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.100]   because that's what all of their compensation structures
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:32.980]   and all their goal planning structures are based around.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:35.260]   They're based around what is losing us business
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:36.820]   or getting us business.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:38.980]   - Yeah, it's fascinating organizationally though
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.940]   to think about banks, they're very old school
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:46.340]   and their ability to move quickly is questionable to me.
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:50.140]   I just look at basic online banking,
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:55.100]   how good banks are creating a frictionless online experience
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:58.660]   and I think they're not very good.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:01.180]   And so that speaks to the kind of people
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:03.900]   who are in leadership positions at banks,
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:07.540]   the kind of people they hire, the kind of culture there is.
[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:12.300]   So I do wonder if banks will from inside
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:15.420]   revolutionize themselves to include smart contracts
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:18.780]   or whether totally new competitors will have to emerge
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:22.340]   that basically create new kinds of banks.
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:26.260]   Whether, what is it, the company Square?
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:29.620]   I think it comes up out of nowhere really
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.900]   with Cash App and they have Bitcoin on Cash App,
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:34.460]   whether they will start incorporating smart contracts
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:39.460]   and they will revolutionize the whole banking industry
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:44.660]   or whether Bank of America will revolutionize themselves
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.020]   from within.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:48.140]   I'm skeptical on Bank of America,
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:50.100]   but you never know.
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:53.700]   It's in general, I'm fascinated by how big organizations,
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:56.820]   whether it's Google or Microsoft or Bank of America
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:00.740]   pivot hard in a world that's quickly changing.
[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:05.500]   I think that takes bold leadership and a lot of firing
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:08.140]   and a lot of pain and a lot of meetings
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:10.700]   where the one asshole brings up the,
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:13.500]   from first principles idea that, you know what,
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:16.340]   the ways we've been doing stuff in the past require,
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:17.980]   you know, we need to throw that out
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:20.420]   and do stuff totally differently.
[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:22.460]   I know a lot of those assholes
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:25.300]   in a lot of these different industries.
[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:27.060]   First of all, I think they're getting listened to more.
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:30.460]   And second of all, I think all of these places,
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:32.380]   as I look at it more and more,
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:35.420]   I think they have a fundamental line of business
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:37.060]   that they try to protect.
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.980]   And then everybody's compensation
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:40.380]   and everybody's metrics and goals
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:43.060]   is focused around that line of business.
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:48.060]   So the second that things begin to impact that,
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:52.500]   then everybody will be in a senior meeting
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:55.180]   and that asshole will be quite listened to
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:58.020]   because he will have the only thoughtful explanation
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:45:59.900]   as to why this is happening.
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:02.940]   How things will evolve from there, I actually don't know
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.740]   because that hasn't been the case yet.
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:08.700]   But my thinking is that there will be people
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:12.020]   who don't wanna cannibalize certain parts of their business
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:15.020]   or don't wanna change certain parts of their business.
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:16.420]   And then there'll be people who say,
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:18.940]   "Look, I think this is how the world's gonna work.
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:20.740]   We're gonna make a very, very heavy
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:27.300]   kind of set of commitments to put resources towards this."
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:29.820]   I already see that with a few banks
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:33.100]   working on various blockchain-based systems.
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:34.860]   But granted, they've been working on those for years.
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:37.420]   So I think all of this comes down
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:39.860]   to these kind of quarterly earnings calls
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.300]   where somebody asks them,
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:45.420]   "Hey, I saw that bank over there launched a blockchain bond
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:47.860]   or a smart contract derivative platform.
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.580]   And I also saw that they made $10 billion in revenues
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:55.020]   or $10 billion in volume or whatever it is from that.
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:56.380]   What's your plan?"
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:58.100]   Right, on the earnings call.
[01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:02.060]   And I promise you by the next earnings call, there's a plan.
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:03.380]   And then the question on the next one is,
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:04.700]   "Well, when's the plan gonna happen?"
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:08.420]   And then by the next earnings call, a plan is happening.
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:11.540]   And that's what these people are sensitive to.
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:13.740]   That's what these organizations are structured around.
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:17.180]   It's not completely economically disconnected, right?
[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:20.420]   They have this core business, they wanna protect it.
[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:22.980]   I understand that idea,
[01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:26.020]   but I think that the problem with that
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:31.020]   is sometimes it requires this myopic focus, right?
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:34.500]   And that's what all the innovation stuff is about.
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.580]   Every time somebody at a corporate entity
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:40.260]   is about innovation, they're trying to sidestep this.
[01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:42.340]   But once again, the incentives to maintain
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:45.260]   whatever the core business is, is so strong
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:49.180]   that the innovation people, even though they are there,
[01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:53.740]   I think they get a phone call and go like,
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:55.540]   "What are we doing for this?"
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:58.540]   And the ones that actually did good work
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:00.620]   and got ready to do something for this
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:03.980]   have done their employer and their organization
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:05.820]   a very positive service.
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:07.820]   Whereas the ones that aren't ready,
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:09.940]   I mean, they'll make up something
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:11.940]   and maybe they're really smart and they'll get it together.
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:12.900]   I don't know.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:15.220]   - Can we talk about tokens a little bit?
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:19.620]   Generally speaking, there's been a meteoric rise
[01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:20.940]   of a bunch of different tokens.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:24.300]   We could just talk about Bitcoin and Ethereum as examples.
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:27.980]   Bitcoin, I think, costs $60,000 in value.
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:31.100]   What are your thoughts in general on this rise?
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:32.500]   What's the future of Bitcoin?
[01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:34.060]   What's the future of Ethereum?
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:38.900]   There's the total value locked metric
[01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:42.060]   that I think generalizes the different kind of value
[01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:45.260]   of these tokens.
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:50.980]   What is the future value and impact
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:52.380]   of cryptocurrency look like
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:54.900]   if we look through the lens of these tokens?
[01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:58.420]   - I think valuing all these tokens
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.940]   and determining that isn't something
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:01.300]   I'm particularly great at.
[01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:02.940]   I haven't spent a lot of time on that.
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:04.140]   I've spent the majority,
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:06.860]   vast majority of my time on building these systems
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:08.980]   and architecting them and getting them to fruition
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:11.580]   and getting them to a place where they operate properly
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:13.260]   on both the technical and the crypto economic
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:15.580]   and in every other sense.
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:20.580]   I think with Bitcoin, there is a certain conception
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:24.460]   of non-governmental fiat money
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:28.820]   that Bitcoin is really the first creator of.
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:31.940]   So there's this very powerful idea called fiat money.
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:36.940]   It's basically more or less a kind of 40-year experiment.
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:39.260]   I think on August 15th of this year is maybe,
[01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:41.340]   I think given the 40th anniversary,
[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:42.940]   government can say, "Hey, I have a currency
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:46.180]   "and it's worth something and here it is."
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:50.820]   In terms of the way that governments have stopped that
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:53.500]   in the past is if anyone tries to make another fiat currency
[01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:56.460]   in their country, they immediately shut it down.
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:58.860]   They immediately say, "Hey, this is really bad.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:00.380]   "You've done something really bad.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:01.580]   "It's time for you to stop.
[01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:03.060]   "Don't do it anymore."
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:04.260]   And it stops.
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:07.860]   That's been the history of non-governmental fiat currency.
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:12.220]   Bitcoin is really due to its decentralized nature,
[01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:15.300]   the first and possibly in some cases,
[01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:16.140]   in many people's minds,
[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:19.740]   it's still the only true non-governmental fiat currency.
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:24.460]   Now, how powerful is non-governmental fiat currency?
[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:25.540]   I have no idea.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:31.540]   It's really as powerful as the ideas
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:33.620]   that people ascribe to it are.
[01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:36.900]   So let's say people start saying,
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:38.060]   like right now people are saying,
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:39.340]   "Hey, it's internet money.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:41.780]   "It's the money of the internet."
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:42.820]   Okay, great.
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:43.660]   What's that worth?
[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:44.500]   I don't know.
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:45.340]   It's probably worth a lot.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:46.180]   I have no idea what it's worth.
[01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:51.180]   But as an idea, as a concept to underpin the fiat money,
[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:56.300]   the let there be aspect of fiat and of Bitcoin,
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:58.500]   you basically look at it and you say,
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.140]   "Yeah, internet money.
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:02.460]   "Okay, that could be worth whatever,
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:04.940]   "60,000, 600,000."
[01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:06.220]   Great question, right?
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:08.780]   There are other versions of the world, right?
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:09.920]   Where people say,
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.600]   "There are countries that don't have a good fiat currency.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:17.060]   "And I see a lot of people using Bitcoin."
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:19.580]   So Bitcoin isn't internet money.
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:24.260]   It's countries without a good currency money.
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:25.980]   So all the countries without a good currency
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:30.100]   now use Bitcoin and let there be Bitcoin
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:31.940]   as this, right?
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:33.260]   As this conception of Bitcoin.
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:34.740]   What's the value of that?
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:35.580]   I don't know.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:36.400]   That's a great question.
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:37.820]   Probably huge amount of value.
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:42.740]   Then there's a further conception of Bitcoin
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:45.060]   as some digital gold.
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:46.660]   There's a scarcity dynamic.
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:49.580]   There's all these other kinds of dynamics.
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:52.700]   What is a portable version of digital gold
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:57.700]   with some kind of built-in scarcity worth,
[01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:02.060]   kind of artificially created scarcity?
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:03.860]   What's that worth?
[01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:05.100]   I don't know.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.700]   That's a great question.
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:08.820]   I haven't done the analysis on that as the point.
[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:10.300]   Might be worth a lot.
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:13.740]   What is it all worth if all three of these things
[01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:17.100]   flow into the same fiat,
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:20.140]   kind of let there be Bitcoin as these three things,
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:21.580]   conception of Bitcoin?
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:23.580]   I don't know what that's worth.
[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:24.420]   I also don't know what that's worth.
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:26.800]   But could be worth a huge amount.
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:28.940]   So I think it's not,
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:30.980]   I personally don't think it's super important
[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:32.260]   what I think it's worth
[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:34.420]   or what many other people think it's worth.
[01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:36.460]   I don't think that's really that important.
[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:38.220]   I think what's probably important
[01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:43.220]   is understanding what the societal conception of Bitcoin is
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:49.440]   and how does that societal conception evolve over time.
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:52.020]   And that, interestingly enough,
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:56.220]   doesn't just depend on you or me
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.100]   or the people who made Bitcoin or anything else.
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:00.700]   It actually depends on current events.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:02.700]   So for example, if people suddenly say,
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:05.940]   I'm more and more worried about fiat currency,
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:09.400]   I'm more and more worried that governmental fiat,
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:12.500]   even if it's the most reliable version of that,
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.540]   is not as good as I thought it was,
[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:17.780]   maybe I should go on the PayPal app
[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:20.420]   and maybe I should get some Bitcoin just in case.
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:25.740]   What's the world where Bitcoin is a certain percentage
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:28.020]   of everyone's ownership as a hedge
[01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:32.780]   against governmental fiat money not being so good?
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:35.140]   Haven't done the analysis, but another example, right?
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:36.940]   Here's this conception.
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:38.260]   That's the conception.
[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:40.000]   So when I look at Bitcoin,
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.620]   what I see is a lot of these fascinating conceptions
[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:47.620]   of what the fiat, let there be value of Bitcoin is.
[01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:49.520]   By the way, all of them could be true.
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:51.820]   Maybe some of them are true,
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:53.340]   maybe some of them aren't true.
[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:54.580]   And the fascinating thing is,
[01:53:54.580 --> 01:53:56.900]   is that I've seen this conception change, right?
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:53:59.020]   So when I started in the Bitcoin space,
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:01.940]   the conception was micropayments.
[01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:05.380]   The cost of Bitcoin is low, we'll have micropayments.
[01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:06.660]   Micropayments are wonderful
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:09.740]   for machine to machine transactions.
[01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:12.420]   Micropayments are wonderful in the emerging market.
[01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:13.380]   And that's fine, right?
[01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:15.780]   And that was one conception of Bitcoin
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:19.620]   as let there be Bitcoin as micropayments platform, right?
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:21.900]   But then the value rose and certain things changed.
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:23.980]   There was enough expansion in certain ways.
[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:26.580]   And now the conception has evolved
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:28.540]   into this other conception.
[01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:30.740]   But at the end of the day,
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:34.660]   I think governments have a very clear set of steps
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:39.660]   for directing the public's conception of their fiat, right?
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:44.220]   They say our fiat is worth this for these reasons.
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:45.620]   Bitcoin doesn't have that.
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:49.220]   Bitcoin doesn't have an official Bitcoin spokesperson
[01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:50.780]   that goes out and says,
[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:53.220]   the non-governmental money called Bitcoin,
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:55.380]   the non-governmental fiat money called Bitcoin
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:57.980]   has value on the basis of this, this, this, and this.
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:00.740]   Here's our fiscal budget, here's our future plans.
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:04.100]   Our money will continue to be safe and secure and reliable.
[01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:07.340]   And so what that hole creates
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:09.140]   is a hole that we all fill, right?
[01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:11.500]   We all basically come to some vague
[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:16.500]   kind of group understanding that Bitcoin is worth this
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:20.900]   because it is tied to,
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:27.260]   let's say all non-governmental fiat money
[01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:30.420]   comes into question, everybody doubts it,
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:32.260]   possibly due to inflation.
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:35.540]   And everybody says, this is nice,
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:39.460]   but I'd like to keep 10, 20% of my wealth
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:42.940]   in non-governmental fiat just in case.
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:46.300]   What are those numbers?
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:49.340]   I mean, if that happens,
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:51.180]   I'm guessing you can add a few zeros.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:55.060]   - I like how you say, I haven't done the analysis
[01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:56.900]   as if I'm sure a lot of people have done
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:59.380]   quote unquote analysis, but it's not,
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:00.540]   it's still speculation.
[01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:02.060]   Nobody can predict the future,
[01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:04.780]   especially when so much of it has to do
[01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:07.420]   with a large number of people
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:09.340]   holding an idea in their mind
[01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:13.300]   as to the importance of a particular technology like Bitcoin.
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:15.340]   There's a lot of excitement by its possibilities,
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:19.420]   but the number of zeros you add is an open question
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:21.980]   and nobody can do a perfect analysis
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:24.380]   except whoever created this simulation.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:28.660]   Let me ask you this question.
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:33.100]   Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:37.760]   There's quite a few people who suggest that person is you.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:42.660]   So is it you?
[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:43.500]   - No.
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:46.740]   - Who do you think it could be?
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:48.620]   - I don't know who it is.
[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:50.100]   I think if I had to guess,
[01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:52.060]   it's probably a group of people,
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:54.420]   some of which might not even be around anymore.
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:57.380]   Obviously I'm very grateful to,
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:56:59.180]   if this is a singular or a group of people
[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:00.660]   for kicking off this entire industry
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:02.740]   and making this amazing change in the world
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:05.500]   that I have the privilege and luxury
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:08.460]   of being part of in some small way in the work that I do.
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:13.460]   I think also this kind of focus on who is Satoshi
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:17.660]   or who isn't Satoshi shouldn't in my opinion matter so much
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:20.020]   because regardless of who it is,
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:24.060]   that in my opinion should have no substantial,
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:27.740]   significant effect or bearing on the functioning
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:31.300]   or the value or the use or the security
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:33.460]   of the Bitcoin system.
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:35.820]   So I think whoever it is,
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:38.860]   they're probably better off not making that public.
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:40.220]   And I think beyond that,
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:43.740]   whoever it turned out to be shouldn't matter
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:46.340]   because it has nothing to do
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:48.620]   with how the system is made useful
[01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:50.740]   or secure or anything else.
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:54.460]   And so I think that's the point of view that I have.
[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:58.160]   - Now, if you were Satoshi Nakamoto, would you tell me?
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:02.220]   Because you said they shouldn't,
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:05.500]   whoever Satoshi is, he should keep that private.
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:07.580]   So would you tell it to me or no?
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:12.060]   - We're in some kind of weird like thought experiment here.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:16.980]   If I was this guy, let me think about this,
[01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:18.140]   which I'm not by the way,
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:19.260]   I am not this person.
[01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:21.580]   - But if you were, would you say it?
[01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:29.380]   - I think probably not.
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:30.220]   I don't see the,
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:33.020]   I think that they would cause a lot of distraction
[01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:34.940]   and a lot of weird stuff.
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:38.900]   And so realistically, I don't think it would help anybody
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:40.860]   or even the person who discloses it.
[01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:42.500]   But just to be clear, I am not.
[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:45.020]   And whoever it is, I think they haven't said anything
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:46.540]   because they don't want the attention
[01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:47.940]   and they don't want the distraction
[01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:49.820]   and they don't want all the problems from this.
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:53.060]   And that makes sense to me conceptually.
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:55.180]   - It's fascinating to think if they're still out there
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:58.800]   and part of the Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency community.
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:04.940]   And it is inspiring to think that if they're out there,
[01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:09.100]   that they're not revealing their identity
[01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:11.380]   because it would be a distraction.
[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:13.080]   That's kind of inspiring that people are like that.
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:14.660]   Just like George Washington,
[01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:18.020]   relinquishing power is inspiring
[01:59:18.020 --> 01:59:20.580]   'cause it's ultimately about the progress of the community.
[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:24.040]   Not some kind of ego driven attention scheme.
[01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:26.380]   Again, very inspiring.
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:29.740]   The humans at their best are inspiring.
[01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:31.700]   What do you think about the certainty
[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:34.780]   that people in the Bitcoin maximalist community
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:37.720]   have about this particular piece of technology, Bitcoin?
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:41.560]   Is there something interesting that you think
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:44.380]   that you might wanna say about this community
[01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:46.600]   or is it just is what it is?
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:49.780]   - I think at the end of the day,
[01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:51.740]   results speak for themselves
[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:55.900]   and Bitcoin has had an amazing impact on our industry
[01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:59.020]   and has had an amazing impact on the world.
[01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:01.140]   And I think the result is still
[02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:03.480]   that Bitcoin is very widely adopted
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:07.260]   and driving the adoption of our industry in many ways.
[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:09.860]   So I think it's very difficult for people to say that,
[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:12.820]   Bitcoin maximalists don't have something
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:14.140]   that they can latch onto and say,
[02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:16.380]   hey, there's something very real here.
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:20.020]   I think there's been decisions made by the Bitcoin community
[02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:21.900]   and the people who made the Bitcoin protocol
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:24.460]   to focus it on Bitcoin
[02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:28.220]   and to focus it on the kind of storing
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:31.100]   of the ledger of Bitcoin and the information about Bitcoin
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:34.900]   and the transaction of Bitcoin and to focus on securing that.
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:37.580]   And I understand why that decision was made
[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:38.580]   to a certain degree, right?
[02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:39.980]   It was about focus.
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:43.100]   It was about getting something worthwhile, right?
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:46.820]   Without adding additional features and additional risk.
[02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:49.980]   And that decision is a decision that was made
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:53.780]   and has kind of the benefits of focus
[02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:57.460]   and the benefits of a certain amount of security
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:01.140]   and a certain amount of guarantees around Bitcoin
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:04.380]   and what that is and the value of that.
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:07.780]   And then it has certain limitations
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:10.860]   as a consequence of doing less
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:13.700]   or having the system hold data that isn't related to Bitcoin
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:16.820]   or not having the system hold contracts,
[02:01:16.820 --> 02:01:19.980]   contractual outcomes or smart contract code.
[02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:22.060]   So I think it's just kind of a decision, right?
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:25.620]   And I understand why they're excited and I'm very excited.
[02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:28.340]   I started in this industry going to Bitcoin meetups
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:32.020]   and I met a lot of fantastic people, libertarian people
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:34.500]   that wanted to see the world work differently
[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:37.660]   and shared a lot of my beliefs and a lot of my points of view.
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:40.100]   And so, anyone who's been in the industry
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:44.260]   as long as I have, has had to come
[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:45.900]   from the Bitcoin ecosystem by virtue
[02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:48.300]   of kind of starting out that early.
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:50.740]   So I have an unbelievable amount of respect
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:55.100]   and admiration and gratitude for Bitcoin
[02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:56.660]   and that it exists and everything that it's done
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:58.180]   and that it birthed this industry.
[02:01:58.180 --> 02:02:00.140]   There's absolutely no doubt about that.
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:04.540]   At the same time, whatever design decisions people make
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:07.100]   are the design decisions they make, right?
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:09.100]   And so if you've made a design decision
[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:12.020]   that this ledger and this thing will be about Bitcoin,
[02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:14.020]   it won't be about colored coins,
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:16.620]   it won't be about op return at 80 bytes,
[02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:20.620]   it won't be about these other kind of nuances
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:23.820]   that you don't want this to be about, then that's fine.
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:26.540]   That's fine and that's a logical decision
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:28.260]   and that's called focus.
[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:30.220]   And focus has a lot of value
[02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:32.780]   and a lot of great technology products
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:36.660]   have focused on something and done that.
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:39.140]   And then there's a lot of smart people around Bitcoin
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:41.900]   building kind of additional systems
[02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:44.300]   that anchor their security within Bitcoin.
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:46.020]   And I think that's an interesting approach
[02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:47.620]   that could bear fruit.
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:51.220]   I think it'll eventually require an interaction
[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:54.380]   with a Bitcoin protocol in more advanced ways.
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:56.260]   And then there'll be another question of,
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:59.020]   what is the design decision for Bitcoin?
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:02.620]   Is it that Bitcoin will be just about the Bitcoin ledger
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:07.620]   or does Bitcoin want to evolve into an anchor
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:10.660]   for all these other systems
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:13.300]   and maybe create additional data store,
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:17.340]   kind of more data on the Bitcoin blockchain related to that.
[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:20.620]   So I'm excited to see how that evolves,
[02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:23.620]   but until then kind of results speak for themselves
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:26.500]   and the results that Bitcoin has achieved for our industry
[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:30.300]   and for itself as kind of the dominant cryptocurrency
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:31.980]   and the conception of our industry
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:35.260]   that people interact with first is obviously very important
[02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:39.220]   and something that I think really everybody in our industry
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:40.220]   is grateful for, right?
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:44.020]   Because without Bitcoin, where would our industry be?
[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:46.980]   And that's obviously something that we can't forget.
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:49.540]   - What are your thoughts about Ethereum
[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:54.500]   in the chain link distributed Oracle network world?
[02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:57.380]   Is it competition?
[02:03:57.380 --> 02:03:59.460]   Is it collaboration?
[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:02.220]   Is it complimentary technology?
[02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:03.500]   What do you think about Ethereum?
[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:05.300]   How much do you think about Ethereum?
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:07.140]   What role does it have?
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:08.500]   - Yeah, I think about a lot.
[02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:11.100]   I think we're completely complimentary.
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:13.940]   So there's no competitive dynamics in my opinion.
[02:04:13.940 --> 02:04:16.420]   We are completely collaborative and complimentary
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:18.780]   with Ethereum and all other blockchains
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:23.020]   and all other layer twos that operate a contract, right?
[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:26.220]   So we do not seek to operate a smart contract.
[02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:29.860]   We seek to augment and enable smart contracts
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:32.940]   to go further in what they're able to do.
[02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:36.060]   In fact, Oracle networks have some value
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:38.500]   but they don't have nearly as much value in what they do
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:40.580]   if there isn't a mission critical system
[02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:43.420]   like a smart contract that needs their data, right?
[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:46.100]   So we've made our own explicit design decisions
[02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:48.660]   in our own and created our own focus
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:53.660]   around guaranteeing that smart contracts can go further.
[02:04:53.660 --> 02:04:54.940]   We've already done that, right?
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:57.860]   Decentralized finance, the rate at which we put data
[02:04:57.860 --> 02:04:59.380]   is to a degree the rate at which certain
[02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:01.460]   decentralized financial markets grow.
[02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:02.540]   And as we put more data,
[02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:04.860]   we see more financial products go live.
[02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:06.020]   Gaming, we provide VRF.
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:07.460]   So we have this kind of focus
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:09.660]   and it's a very useful and valuable
[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:13.780]   for our industry focus.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:15.420]   At the end of the day,
[02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:19.620]   I think that smart contract platforms like Ethereum
[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:22.460]   made a different set of design decisions
[02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:23.500]   from Bitcoin and others.
[02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:26.940]   And they focused on creating the smart contract capability
[02:05:26.940 --> 02:05:32.700]   and they kind of wanted that functionality to exist.
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:33.540]   And I think since then,
[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:34.380]   there's been a number of people
[02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:35.500]   that try to improve on that
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:37.940]   or try to make variants of that.
[02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:39.540]   From our point of view,
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:41.860]   we want to support smart contracts
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:46.380]   in all of their variations and in all of their use cases.
[02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:49.220]   So one of the things that I personally like about Chainlink
[02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:52.420]   is their ability or Chainlink's ability
[02:05:52.420 --> 02:05:53.580]   and the Chainlink network's ability
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:55.820]   to be useful to many different chains
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:58.420]   and across many different use cases.
[02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:00.420]   I'm personally a fan of Ethereum.
[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:03.220]   Ethereum has done a huge amount for our industry as well.
[02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:05.340]   Ethereum took us from a world where
[02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:07.980]   it literally took months to make a new smart contract
[02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:10.980]   by being forced to code it into a protocol.
[02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:12.580]   You had to go to the protocol developers
[02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:15.340]   and you had to say, "Hey, I need a DEX
[02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:17.380]   or I need some kind of smart contract."
[02:06:17.380 --> 02:06:19.340]   Put it in the protocol itself.
[02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:21.900]   Put it in the actual blockchain mining
[02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:23.460]   and kind of block generation,
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.420]   transaction generation protocol.
[02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:27.700]   That would take months or sometimes even over a year.
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:29.100]   That was a horrible experience.
[02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:31.660]   And obviously very few people wanted to participate in that.
[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:33.820]   And so very few people made smart contracts,
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:35.940]   which I was not a fan of.
[02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:37.220]   And then Ethereum came along
[02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:39.740]   and really did a lot of innovative things
[02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:43.380]   and introduced this approach to scriptable smart contracts
[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:47.020]   where you could script all of these different conditions.
[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:49.020]   And I found that fascinating.
[02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:50.740]   Before Ethereum, I found that fascinating.
[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:52.180]   Once Ethereum arrived,
[02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:54.420]   I found it fascinating after Ethereum launched
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:55.700]   and I still find it fascinating.
[02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:58.700]   And I'm also very grateful to Vitalik
[02:06:58.700 --> 02:06:59.660]   and the Ethereum community
[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:01.380]   and all the core developers there
[02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:03.980]   for taking our industry a step further.
[02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:06.700]   So I think they absolutely deserve a huge amount of credit
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:09.140]   for taking our industry from,
[02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:12.180]   it takes months to make a really small smart contract
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:15.980]   to it takes weeks to make a relatively secure,
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:18.260]   relatively advanced piece of on-chain code
[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:21.580]   that anybody can script and people can do audits on.
[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:25.580]   And that's an unbelievable leap forward for our industry.
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:28.260]   And I'm genuinely grateful to them for that.
[02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:32.180]   I think the next step in line with our body of work
[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:36.420]   is how does that scriptable on-chain code
[02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:40.100]   become more advanced in its interaction
[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:44.380]   with all of the systems and events in the real world,
[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:45.420]   which is in my opinion,
[02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:48.380]   the final missing piece of the puzzle, right?
[02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:49.660]   So my body of work,
[02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:51.220]   the body of work that I'm involved in
[02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:52.580]   would not be where it is right now
[02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:54.620]   without Bitcoin by any measure.
[02:07:54.620 --> 02:07:57.140]   It wouldn't even be where it is now without Ethereum
[02:07:57.140 --> 02:07:59.700]   and the growth in smart contract development
[02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:01.380]   that they've created.
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:04.820]   And now what I think is gonna happen next
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:07.580]   is there'll be a lot of different smart contract platforms,
[02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:09.300]   a lot of different layer twos.
[02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:11.020]   Some of them will be private for enterprise.
[02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:12.500]   Some of them will be public.
[02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:15.140]   There'll be some public winners in certain geographies
[02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:18.100]   for maybe regulation reasons, maybe other reasons.
[02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:20.420]   There'll be other public winners,
[02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:21.940]   the larger internet,
[02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:23.580]   and there'll be a number of different people
[02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:26.580]   building smart contracts in different languages.
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:29.260]   We are excited and I am excited
[02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:30.940]   and the Chainlink community is excited.
[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:33.340]   And basically there's a lot of,
[02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:37.020]   I mean, for lack of a better word, excitement
[02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:40.060]   in seeing our industry graduate
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:43.940]   to providing more use cases,
[02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:46.820]   more usable hybrid smart contracts, right?
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:49.300]   Because once again, it's absolutely amazing
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.780]   that Bitcoin created non-governmental fiat money.
[02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:53.380]   It's an unbelievable innovation
[02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:55.860]   and invented the centralized infrastructure
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:57.540]   and birthed our industry.
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:09:00.380]   It's an unbelievably great achievement,
[02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:01.540]   an amazing achievement
[02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:03.300]   that we now have scriptable smart contracts
[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:04.700]   through something like Ethereum.
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:07.740]   Once again, monumental achievement in my opinion.
[02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:10.820]   Once again, we still need to look to the future.
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:13.500]   We need to look to how do we take
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:16.140]   the decentralized infrastructure concepts
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:17.940]   that Bitcoin initially put forward,
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:19.700]   that Ethereum then improved upon
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:23.420]   and created into these scriptable smart contract formats,
[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:25.020]   and how do we expand that
[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:28.060]   into the world of real world outcomes
[02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:29.900]   to change the global financial industry,
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:31.380]   the global trade industry,
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:33.580]   the global data marketplace industry,
[02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:36.260]   and many other global industries.
[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:38.340]   - You mentioned results speak for themselves
[02:09:38.340 --> 02:09:41.660]   and how design decisions have consequences.
[02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:45.020]   The Chainlink community have come up
[02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:48.180]   with a lot of brilliant designs.
[02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:51.780]   So how do you think through the design choices
[02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:53.180]   that you're facing,
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:55.580]   where you can't predict the future,
[02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:58.740]   but you're trying to create a better future?
[02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:02.540]   Is there something low level,
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:06.060]   introspective advice that you can give
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:09.180]   or describe as to how you think through those decisions
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:12.180]   or high level, how you think about those decisions?
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:14.540]   - Sure, absolutely.
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:17.220]   I think that's a great question.
[02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:19.460]   And I think that actually gets to the core
[02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:23.180]   of what the Chainlink network is supposed to achieve.
[02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:27.580]   We are supposed to achieve a maximally flexible system.
[02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:29.980]   So once again, this is the big difference
[02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:32.580]   between Chainlink and Oracle networks in general
[02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:34.580]   and blockchains in my opinion.
[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:37.340]   Blockchains do not seek to be maximally flexible, right?
[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:40.260]   They say, here's my block size,
[02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:43.940]   here's the transaction types you can put in those blocks.
[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:46.180]   Here's the contract language I have.
[02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:48.620]   Here's kind of my blockchain system, right?
[02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:51.660]   Here's the fee structure for those blocks.
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:52.860]   They're gonna keep getting, you know,
[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:56.500]   kind of composed transactions are gonna get put into blocks,
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:58.380]   blocks will get connected and it'll continue, right?
[02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:00.460]   And that's a very focused type of system.
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:01.300]   And that's great.
[02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:03.060]   And that makes sense because it's focused
[02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:05.900]   on creating security for that category
[02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:08.340]   of on-chain activity, which is once again,
[02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:10.300]   a critical, critical part of building
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:11.780]   a highly transparent system
[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:13.860]   and something that Chainlink enables
[02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:14.940]   and, you know, doesn't compete with
[02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:16.340]   and just enables to do more.
[02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:21.380]   Oracle networks conversely have to interact
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:25.540]   with all the world's data and provide all the services
[02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:27.220]   that blockchains don't provide, right?
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:28.540]   So there's kind of a spectrum.
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:31.020]   On one end of the spectrum, you have blockchains
[02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:33.340]   that are highly secure, highly reliable,
[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:36.620]   highly tamper-proof, highly transparent,
[02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:38.500]   but are not very feature-rich.
[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:41.020]   For example, they cannot talk to an API.
[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:42.540]   Many of them can't generate randomness.
[02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:46.180]   They cannot do some kind of privacy-preserving computation.
[02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:48.220]   So they're very secure and there are these kind
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:52.060]   of data structures and smart contract platforms
[02:11:52.060 --> 02:11:55.700]   to hold on-chain code that can define conditions,
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:59.340]   receive value, pay value back out under conditions
[02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:01.060]   and create transparency around all that,
[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:03.100]   which makes perfect sense.
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:05.620]   And then there's oracles and oracle networks.
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:08.420]   That is all the world's data, right?
[02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:11.100]   We're talking about taking all the world's data
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:14.620]   and making it consumable for all the world's use cases
[02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:16.300]   that have trust issues.
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:19.180]   So the amount of variability there is absolutely massive.
[02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:20.020]   Right?
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:22.340]   It's like the decentralized oracle network
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:24.780]   and the conditions that that decentralized oracle network
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:28.340]   needs to meet is going to vary very widely
[02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:32.060]   from an insurance contract to a lending contract
[02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:36.740]   to an ad network contract to the data sales contract
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:40.740]   that we discussed to any number of other smart contracts.
[02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:44.660]   So really the ability of a decentralized oracle network
[02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:47.820]   to flexibly address all of those requirements
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:48.980]   is what's necessary.
[02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:53.700]   - So flexibility is the goal, whereas with on-chain
[02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:57.620]   like Bitcoin, flexibility is the enemy
[02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:00.100]   in the sense that you want security,
[02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:03.380]   you want the focus there.
[02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:05.500]   And in that kind of world,
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:08.220]   design decisions have huge consequences.
[02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:12.060]   And then if you look at the distributor oracle network side,
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:16.220]   you want to remove the restrictions of design choices.
[02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:19.060]   You want to provide maximal flexibility then.
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:23.740]   So it's a completely separate kind of design framework.
[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:25.180]   - It's a slightly different problem, right?
[02:13:25.180 --> 02:13:28.220]   Because we're not trying to define transaction types
[02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:30.460]   fitting into blocks on a certain timeline
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:32.260]   and have those blocks being generated.
[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:35.260]   We're trying to say, "Hey, there's this world of services
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:37.780]   or this world of data that's not very deterministic,
[02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:39.340]   but it's unbelievably useful
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:40.940]   to these smart contracts over here."
[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:43.060]   And actually they needed to even exist.
[02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:45.580]   And we really want them to exist because once they exist,
[02:13:45.580 --> 02:13:46.780]   it's going to completely redefine
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:48.780]   what our whole industry is known for, right?
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:51.660]   And defined NFTs are not even the tip of the iceberg.
[02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:54.420]   They're like the snow coming off the top of the iceberg.
[02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:58.540]   And so our goal is to create a framework
[02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:01.180]   and an infrastructure and a software
[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:04.420]   that allows people to compose
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:06.180]   decentralized oracle networks, right?
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:10.060]   So initially you can compose a decentralized oracle network
[02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:12.940]   of seven nodes that goes to three data sources
[02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:15.420]   to trigger your contract worth a million dollars.
[02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:16.580]   And that's where you could start.
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:18.100]   And then let's say your smart contract,
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:20.620]   your DeFi smart contract goes to a billion dollars.
[02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:22.580]   Well, then you need to make some changes, right?
[02:14:22.580 --> 02:14:26.860]   You need to go from seven nodes to 15 or maybe 31 nodes.
[02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:30.100]   And you need to go from three data sources to five or seven.
[02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:32.940]   And you maybe need to create some kind of
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:36.980]   what we call circuit breakers and some other checks.
[02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:39.020]   And you need to make sure that the decentralized oracle
[02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:41.540]   network comes to consensus around those checks.
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:43.660]   Because now the centralized oracle network
[02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:44.700]   isn't controlling a million dollars,
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:46.180]   it's controlling a billion dollars.
[02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:48.020]   And we have decentralized oracle networks
[02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:49.580]   that control well over a billion dollars,
[02:14:49.580 --> 02:14:51.300]   multiple billions of dollars.
[02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:53.260]   And we see them growing and getting more advanced
[02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:55.940]   data sources and more advanced features.
[02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:57.660]   And then if somebody else comes and says,
[02:14:57.660 --> 02:14:59.900]   "Well, I don't really wanna make a DeFi product,
[02:14:59.900 --> 02:15:01.500]   I wanna make crop insurance.
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:03.540]   And I have a completely different set of conditions.
[02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:05.380]   I want this method of consensus.
[02:15:05.380 --> 02:15:07.780]   And I want data to be aggregated in this way,
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:08.780]   but not the way that you do
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:10.860]   for decentralized financial products."
[02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:11.980]   I mean, what are we supposed to tell them?
[02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:12.820]   We're supposed to tell them,
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:16.540]   "No, our decentralized oracle network can't let you do that.
[02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:19.580]   And you can go and wait another five years
[02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:22.980]   until somebody builds it for you."
[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:24.580]   That's not what we wanna do, right?
[02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:26.300]   What we wanna do is be able to say,
[02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:30.460]   "Absolutely, here's an example of how somebody else
[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:32.020]   made a decentralized oracle network
[02:15:32.020 --> 02:15:34.860]   for weather insurance, right?
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:37.820]   Here's a template.
[02:15:37.820 --> 02:15:41.300]   Change that template, evolve it to meet your needs."
[02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:42.620]   And then someone else comes and says,
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:46.260]   "Hey, I have some other use case in gaming, right?
[02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:49.540]   I wanna make NFTs related to real world sports events,
[02:15:49.540 --> 02:15:50.980]   or I wanna do whatever I wanna do
[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:54.100]   with some kind of sports related data."
[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:55.140]   Wonderful.
[02:15:55.140 --> 02:15:56.140]   Here's the framework.
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:58.180]   Here are your risk dynamics.
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:16:00.460]   Here's a collection of node operators.
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:03.940]   Here's a set of pre-integrated data sources.
[02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:08.060]   Here's a reputation system to assess the quality
[02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:09.900]   of your ensemble of nodes.
[02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:11.260]   Here's a way to scale that up
[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:14.580]   as the value in your contract scales.
[02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:18.540]   Here's all the tools that you need to build this contract.
[02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:20.420]   And what we actually see now
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:23.100]   as there are multiple types of computations
[02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:25.100]   and data sources that are provided
[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:27.420]   by different decentralized oracle networks,
[02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:29.460]   of which there are now hundreds,
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:33.220]   we now see that a single hybrid smart contract
[02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:35.980]   might use multiple decentralized oracle networks.
[02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:38.140]   So there might be a hybrid smart contract
[02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:41.300]   that uses a price data, decentralized oracle network,
[02:16:41.300 --> 02:16:43.300]   a proof of reserve oracle network,
[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:45.580]   a randomness oracle network.
[02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:48.820]   And I think we're gonna continue to see this dynamic
[02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:51.220]   that more and more advanced contracts
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:55.060]   compose various decentralized oracle networks
[02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:57.340]   into more advanced use cases.
[02:16:57.340 --> 02:17:02.340]   And this is the dynamic that we're focused on enabling.
[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:05.060]   And I think it's actually a very virtuous cycle
[02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:08.100]   for everybody because the more of these hybrid smart
[02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:12.060]   contracts we enable on Ethereum and other blockchains,
[02:17:12.060 --> 02:17:15.620]   the more our industry provides real world outcomes
[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:18.420]   to the larger world, which is at the end of the day,
[02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:21.180]   what I think everybody in our industry wants.
[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:24.780]   Everybody in our industry wants hybrid smart contracts
[02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:28.220]   to become the way that global finance works,
[02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:31.340]   global trade works, global insurance products work,
[02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:34.380]   because they will inherently need both a blockchain
[02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:37.020]   on which the contract itself lives,
[02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:39.340]   and an oracle network that powers
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:41.940]   all of the other interactions, right?
[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:44.540]   - As a developer, how would you recommend
[02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:48.540]   somebody listening to this, but also me,
[02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:53.060]   to get started with smart contracts
[02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:56.180]   and to get started with hybrid smart contracts?
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:59.260]   - Well, for hybrid smart contracts,
[02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:01.860]   I'm gonna have to do some kind of shameless promotion.
[02:18:01.860 --> 02:18:04.460]   - Please, let me twist your arm.
[02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:06.780]   - Thank you.
[02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:08.660]   I think you can go to our YouTube.
[02:18:08.660 --> 02:18:11.220]   We have a number of developer tutorials.
[02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:12.300]   - Chainlink YouTube?
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:13.500]   - Yeah, Chainlink.
[02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:15.020]   I think if you just search Chainlink on YouTube,
[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:16.260]   you should find it.
[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:19.620]   Beyond that, we recently had a hackathon
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:21.660]   where we had a huge amount of very,
[02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:25.100]   very kind of advanced hybrid smart contracts getting built.
[02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:28.380]   - To elaborate on that, you had a hackathon.
[02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:30.700]   Is that something that people can follow along
[02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:35.660]   like a video or there's webpage traces of what happened,
[02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:37.780]   or is there future actual hackathons
[02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:39.700]   that people could literally participate in?
[02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:41.620]   - There's plenty of more hackathons coming up.
[02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:44.580]   We wanna enable as many developers in web three and web two
[02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:46.180]   to build hybrid smart contracts
[02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:48.020]   as a way to redefine our industry
[02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:51.540]   and kind of make all of these smart contracts come to life.
[02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:54.140]   There are definitely gonna be more hackathons.
[02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:56.340]   So people should go and pre-register,
[02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:58.340]   register on a list to get involved in that.
[02:18:58.340 --> 02:19:00.340]   That's a great resource where we have a lot of speakers
[02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:01.540]   and a lot of educational tools.
[02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:04.780]   They happen over a course of weeks, not days.
[02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:07.180]   So there's a long time for people to work on these things
[02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:09.900]   at the speed that they find comfortable.
[02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:10.740]   - Two questions.
[02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:14.420]   One, is there a kind of a hello world entry point
[02:19:14.420 --> 02:19:17.820]   for hybrid smart contracts?
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:19.420]   And two, on the hackathon side,
[02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:22.380]   like what kind of stuff do you see people building at first?
[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:24.860]   Just kind of getting their feet wet,
[02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:27.260]   like in terms of the kind of applications
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:28.900]   that could be enabled.
[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:30.500]   - I mean, there's unbelievable things
[02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:32.460]   that we see people building.
[02:19:32.460 --> 02:19:35.180]   I think how to get your feet wet,
[02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:37.180]   I think the hello world is probably DeFi
[02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:38.580]   'cause it's pretty straightforward.
[02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:40.300]   And there's a large amount of data sources
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:42.820]   that we already have putting data on chain on test net,
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:45.380]   which is the test environment in which people would build.
[02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:47.780]   So I think DeFi is probably to a certain degree,
[02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:49.220]   the most exciting for certain people
[02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:54.140]   and pretty, pretty expansive in terms of the tutorials
[02:19:54.140 --> 02:19:55.340]   and the amount of contracts
[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:57.780]   to see how people have already built it.
[02:19:57.780 --> 02:19:58.620]   I think beyond that,
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:01.020]   we see people building amazing things at these hackathons.
[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:02.380]   In the previous hackathon,
[02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:04.700]   we saw somebody build a smart contract
[02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:09.380]   that allows someone to rent out their Tesla, right?
[02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:14.380]   So it allows the Tesla API to give someone else access
[02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:16.500]   and rent out someone's Tesla
[02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:18.060]   on the basis of a smart contract
[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:19.820]   kind of coordinating payment,
[02:20:19.820 --> 02:20:22.420]   which was kind of amazing.
[02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:23.820]   The more recent hackathon,
[02:20:23.820 --> 02:20:25.580]   we saw something called D-Bridge,
[02:20:25.580 --> 02:20:28.340]   which is a cross-chain solution that uses Oracle networks
[02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:30.580]   to confirm data on different chains.
[02:20:30.580 --> 02:20:33.820]   So I think the things that people build
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:37.180]   will just become expansive and varied in ways
[02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:38.880]   that I can't even imagine.
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:44.380]   But I think this recent hackathon saw a huge, huge list
[02:20:44.380 --> 02:20:48.020]   of different kind of winners in different categories.
[02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:49.300]   And there's so many different categories.
[02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:50.780]   We even have a GovTech category
[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:53.060]   and a whole bunch of things.
[02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:54.580]   If people wanna see what's possible,
[02:20:54.580 --> 02:20:55.900]   they can go look at the winners.
[02:20:55.900 --> 02:20:57.900]   I think that's probably a good idea.
[02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:01.340]   Yeah, that'll be on the side of the hackathon.
[02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:03.820]   There's a blog related to that
[02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:05.340]   and we're gonna have more of these.
[02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:08.420]   And once again, our explicit goal
[02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:10.860]   is to take our industry
[02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:13.180]   into this world of hybrid smart contracts,
[02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:14.780]   which just benefits everybody.
[02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:16.860]   It makes more on-chain activity.
[02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:21.020]   It helps provide real-world value to the average person
[02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:23.500]   from all of this infrastructure, period.
[02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:25.000]   And at the end of the day,
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:28.060]   I think that it just redefines what our industry
[02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:29.540]   is about through use cases, right?
[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:33.060]   Because if you only learn through our industry
[02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:34.980]   from the point of view of a single use case,
[02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:37.640]   like the NFT use case or some other use case,
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:39.700]   that's what our industry is about.
[02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:41.600]   And the more of these use cases
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:44.280]   that people can make available to the average person
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:45.640]   or to the fintech world
[02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:47.620]   or to the insurance world or wherever,
[02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:50.700]   the faster our industry will not just be
[02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:52.620]   about Bitcoins or tokens.
[02:21:52.620 --> 02:21:55.180]   It will be about changing global finance,
[02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:58.080]   changing global insurance, changing global trade.
[02:21:58.080 --> 02:22:00.360]   And that's the change in the world
[02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:02.660]   that I and a lot of other people in this industry,
[02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:04.680]   I think, got into this for.
[02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:06.940]   - Now, it's funny, you've mentioned about,
[02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:09.460]   you've had a lot of kind words to say about Bitcoin
[02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:12.420]   and Ethereum as important technology
[02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:14.440]   that paved the way for the future.
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:16.920]   And you somehow did not mention
[02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:18.780]   one of the most profound pieces of technology,
[02:22:18.780 --> 02:22:20.380]   which is Dogecoin.
[02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:22.900]   What are your thoughts about this particular
[02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:26.280]   revolutionary technology?
[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:28.000]   And what are your thoughts about Dogecoin
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.140]   going to the moon, to Mars,
[02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:32.540]   and outside of the solar system?
[02:22:32.540 --> 02:22:36.580]   - I think Dogecoin is a very interesting kind of,
[02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:38.700]   probably closer to a social experiment
[02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:40.040]   than anything else.
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:42.820]   - Isn't everything a social experiment?
[02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:45.160]   - Yeah, I guess that's fair to a degree.
[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:49.160]   I think it's fascinating how that's evolved.
[02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:51.300]   I think the people that made it
[02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:53.060]   with certain goals in mind,
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:56.080]   and then it's kind of taken on a life of its own.
[02:22:56.080 --> 02:22:58.060]   I don't fully understand exactly why
[02:22:58.060 --> 02:23:01.020]   it's taken on a life of its own at this point.
[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:03.020]   I, once again, I don't spend too much time
[02:23:03.020 --> 02:23:07.060]   thinking about different tokens and how they're evolving.
[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:10.700]   I'm much more focused on the launching and--
[02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:13.080]   - The technology around trust,
[02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:15.020]   and all those kinds of ideas.
[02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:18.820]   But I think one of the fascinating things about Dogecoin
[02:23:18.820 --> 02:23:22.240]   is how technology that is,
[02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:26.340]   that leverages social dynamics,
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:29.800]   that technology's ability to utilize fun
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:32.180]   and memes to spread.
[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:34.380]   I think it's really interesting.
[02:23:34.380 --> 02:23:36.540]   I don't think it should be discounted
[02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:39.300]   as if, I think I tweeted today,
[02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:43.060]   something about the fundamental force field of fun,
[02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:47.700]   that fun has an effect on the space-time.
[02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:52.700]   So general relativity describes how mass and energy
[02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:55.340]   can curve space-time.
[02:23:55.340 --> 02:23:58.460]   And I was just giving an example that when life is fun,
[02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:01.520]   it seems short, when life is not fun, it seems very long.
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:04.140]   So fun has a very similar effect on space-time,
[02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:05.740]   like in curved space-time.
[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:10.100]   In that same sense, there is a power to the meme.
[02:24:10.100 --> 02:24:12.500]   And I think Dogecoin illustrates that.
[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:15.640]   I think Elon is an example of somebody that uses Dogecoin.
[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:19.540]   I don't know his philosophy in particular on this aspect,
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:23.720]   but he does use it effectively to excite the world
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:27.440]   in a fun way about the possibilities of future technologies
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:29.060]   like cryptocurrency.
[02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:32.700]   I think the Bitcoin world is very serious right now.
[02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:36.740]   And we've spoken about Bitcoin maximalists.
[02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:40.780]   There is very little space for fun and joking
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:42.660]   in the Bitcoin world,
[02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:47.260]   but there's still a little bit of fun and humor left
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:48.620]   in the Dogecoin world.
[02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:51.660]   In that sense, I think it's exceptionally powerful
[02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:53.260]   to inspire, to excite,
[02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:57.420]   to be able to talk about stuff
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:05.140]   without the seriousness of financial impact
[02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:08.940]   that now certain cryptocurrencies have like Bitcoin.
[02:25:08.940 --> 02:25:11.220]   So I keep an eye on,
[02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:13.820]   I've previously mentioned that Dogecoin, I think,
[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:16.140]   is a fascinating piece of technology
[02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:19.140]   because I do think cryptocurrency is much bigger
[02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:23.900]   than the technology that you focus on.
[02:25:23.900 --> 02:25:27.780]   There is also a social element that you also spoke to
[02:25:27.780 --> 02:25:31.100]   that's, I think, not quite yet understood.
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:33.580]   And it's fascinating to watch,
[02:25:33.580 --> 02:25:35.460]   especially as it co-evolves
[02:25:35.460 --> 02:25:37.340]   with the different tools on the internet,
[02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:39.620]   the different social networks,
[02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:42.180]   social network mechanisms on the internet.
[02:25:42.180 --> 02:25:46.220]   So I'm a huge supporter of Dogecoin
[02:25:46.220 --> 02:25:48.060]   because I'm a huge supporter of fun.
[02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:52.140]   - I'm fascinated to see how it'll work out.
[02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:55.740]   - You think it'll go to the moon?
[02:25:55.740 --> 02:25:57.660]   You think it'll be the first cryptocurrency
[02:25:57.660 --> 02:25:59.260]   to land on the moon?
[02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:00.100]   - I couldn't say.
[02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:04.300]   I haven't done the analysis, as I've said before.
[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:05.660]   - I haven't done the analysis.
[02:26:05.660 --> 02:26:06.500]   Well, yeah.
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:12.500]   No matter what, I do hope we get humans back on the moon
[02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:15.300]   and hopefully get humans on Mars soon.
[02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:18.100]   Dogecoin, Bitcoin,
[02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:21.340]   or not.
[02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:26.020]   Let me ask you about books and movies.
[02:26:26.020 --> 02:26:29.100]   What books and movies in your life,
[02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:32.300]   long ago, when you were a baby Sergei,
[02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:35.500]   or today, had an impact on you?
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:39.140]   Maybe you would recommend to others.
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:43.660]   And maybe what ideas you took away from those books,
[02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:46.980]   movies, coloring books, children's books,
[02:26:46.980 --> 02:26:48.340]   blogs, whatever.
[02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:50.540]   - Yeah, yeah, sure.
[02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:53.980]   So I think one of the things that had a very big impact
[02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:55.980]   on me were Plato's dialogues,
[02:26:55.980 --> 02:26:58.220]   and particularly Protagoras and Gorgias
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:01.500]   as some of the two initial ones.
[02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:05.620]   I think what Plato's dialogues do very well
[02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:08.500]   is they give people a clear picture
[02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:10.020]   of what dialogue looks like
[02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:12.540]   and what the assessment of information
[02:27:12.540 --> 02:27:15.300]   probably should look like, right?
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:18.500]   And how the dissection and analysis
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:20.500]   of an idea is very important.
[02:27:20.500 --> 02:27:22.860]   And how it can actually be taken in either direction.
[02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:24.580]   But at the end of the day,
[02:27:24.580 --> 02:27:26.820]   that the process of eliminating
[02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:30.020]   kind of this fuzzy thinking
[02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:33.380]   and arriving at whether it's an external dialogue
[02:27:33.380 --> 02:27:37.060]   or an internal dialogue about an accurate picture of reality
[02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:38.940]   is actually very important.
[02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:42.460]   And so I think I'm very lucky to have read the dialogues
[02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:44.900]   when I was in my early teenage years.
[02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:46.460]   And it had a very large impact on me
[02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:48.780]   because it kind of showed me that,
[02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:50.980]   nobody knows what they're talking about.
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:54.220]   I would play out dialogues in my mind
[02:27:54.220 --> 02:27:56.780]   and I would engage in certain dialogues
[02:27:56.780 --> 02:27:58.900]   with different people.
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:01.340]   And what the Platonic dialogue showed me
[02:28:01.340 --> 02:28:06.020]   was kind of how to tell when someone has no clue.
[02:28:06.020 --> 02:28:07.780]   And a lot of people are very good at
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:12.660]   kind of saying they have a clue, right?
[02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:14.260]   Saying like, here's how the world works.
[02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:15.540]   Here's what you should do with your life.
[02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:16.780]   Here's what you should do with your time.
[02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:18.020]   Here's what you should do with your money.
[02:28:18.020 --> 02:28:19.820]   Here's what you should do with your attention.
[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:22.420]   Here's what you should do with all these things.
[02:28:22.420 --> 02:28:26.300]   And I think the ability to evaluate information
[02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:31.020]   generally is something that is surprisingly under taught.
[02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:33.900]   I don't actually understand why there isn't a course
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:35.940]   in like high schools or universities
[02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:39.380]   that's just like, here is how you evaluate information.
[02:28:39.380 --> 02:28:41.700]   Here's how you engage in external dialogue
[02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:43.180]   and internal dialogue
[02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:45.540]   to arrive at an accurate picture of reality
[02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:47.260]   rather than the picture of reality
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:48.620]   that other people want you to have
[02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:50.580]   for their benefit most often, right?
[02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:52.780]   And at the end of the day,
[02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:54.780]   I think that put me down a path
[02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:57.140]   to really try and understand.
[02:28:57.140 --> 02:29:00.300]   Beyond that, I think biographies
[02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:02.900]   have had a very large impact on me.
[02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:05.820]   Plutarch's Greek and Roman lives.
[02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:08.380]   After I read Plato, I started reading a bunch of stuff,
[02:29:08.380 --> 02:29:09.220]   Greek stuff.
[02:29:09.220 --> 02:29:10.340]   I was just like, these Greek guys,
[02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:12.420]   they really know how it is.
[02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:15.340]   They did this 2000 years ago and they still got it right.
[02:29:15.340 --> 02:29:16.620]   There's something here.
[02:29:16.620 --> 02:29:19.620]   It's kind of this like theory of time around
[02:29:19.620 --> 02:29:21.060]   the value of intellectual ideas, right?
[02:29:21.060 --> 02:29:24.780]   If an intellectual idea has survived the test of time,
[02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:27.180]   it's much more valuable than the intellectual idea
[02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:28.700]   that I just came up with 10 minutes ago,
[02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:31.300]   haven't told anybody and hasn't gone up against
[02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:35.380]   all of the kind of rebuttals.
[02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:37.740]   - So what's your favorite,
[02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:41.260]   what would you say would be a most impactful biography
[02:29:41.260 --> 02:29:43.260]   that you've come across?
[02:29:43.260 --> 02:29:45.620]   - I don't think it was those Greek or Roman biographies
[02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:48.580]   'cause they were very far away.
[02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:53.580]   I think that probably one of the most impactful ones
[02:29:53.580 --> 02:29:58.420]   that I can remember recently is around Vanderbilt.
[02:29:58.420 --> 02:30:03.660]   And so Vanderbilt was this guy who basically
[02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:05.140]   without that much of an education,
[02:30:05.140 --> 02:30:08.780]   he would invent or work with people
[02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:10.180]   to make these steamboats.
[02:30:10.180 --> 02:30:13.020]   And then he had a lot of acumen around
[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:16.940]   creating certain monopolies regardless of
[02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:22.100]   what was right or wasn't right.
[02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:23.180]   And then fascinatingly enough,
[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:25.460]   it all hinged on like a Supreme Court case
[02:30:25.460 --> 02:30:28.340]   that decided if monopolies were acceptable
[02:30:28.340 --> 02:30:31.940]   in the form of state created monopolies or not.
[02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:36.780]   And if it was deemed that state created monopolies
[02:30:36.780 --> 02:30:39.460]   were acceptable, he would have had a huge problem, this guy.
[02:30:39.460 --> 02:30:41.860]   But it was deemed that state created monopolies
[02:30:41.860 --> 02:30:46.020]   through these licenses for steamboat routes
[02:30:46.020 --> 02:30:47.900]   was not acceptable.
[02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:50.060]   And that did two interesting things.
[02:30:50.060 --> 02:30:54.540]   It unseated some kind of old time landed gentry
[02:30:54.540 --> 02:30:57.940]   in the Americas in like the 1830s and '40s.
[02:30:57.940 --> 02:31:00.820]   And it basically made him right
[02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:03.180]   and he saw it before other people.
[02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:08.180]   So I think Vanderbilt was a very interesting personality
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:11.500]   first of all, of all the biographies that I read
[02:31:11.500 --> 02:31:15.660]   is somebody who really took the situation in hand
[02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:21.300]   and kind of took action to achieve an outcome
[02:31:21.300 --> 02:31:25.180]   which I think was an amazing result.
[02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:27.620]   The fascinating thing by the way is,
[02:31:27.620 --> 02:31:29.500]   or amazing way of looking at things.
[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:32.020]   The fascinating thing by the way is that the ferries now
[02:31:32.020 --> 02:31:36.980]   in New York Harbor are all run as a public good.
[02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:38.540]   So the fascinating thing is that the guy,
[02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:41.700]   he focused on an industry and he worked on something
[02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:43.860]   that was so important that it ended up
[02:31:43.860 --> 02:31:45.860]   becoming a public good.
[02:31:45.860 --> 02:31:48.740]   And I think that that's an interesting conception
[02:31:48.740 --> 02:31:51.820]   of how to look at this industry.
[02:31:51.820 --> 02:31:54.420]   I think there's a lot of economics dynamics
[02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:56.860]   around this industry, but I think I might've said this,
[02:31:56.860 --> 02:31:58.980]   I might've said this somewhere else before,
[02:31:58.980 --> 02:32:02.380]   but really the success of someone in this industry
[02:32:02.380 --> 02:32:06.660]   is whether they're able to make a Linux or HTTP
[02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:11.660]   or an HTTPS like system that lives on for a very long time
[02:32:11.660 --> 02:32:16.540]   and is essentially a kind of public good.
[02:32:16.540 --> 02:32:19.020]   - The success of an idea,
[02:32:19.020 --> 02:32:22.060]   even if that idea is originally sort of a capitalist idea
[02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:25.180]   above that's grounded in financial benefit,
[02:32:25.180 --> 02:32:28.180]   success of it is if it becomes a public good.
[02:32:28.180 --> 02:32:31.700]   It is so universal, it is so fundamental
[02:32:31.700 --> 02:32:34.380]   to the quality of life that it's a public good,
[02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:37.100]   is deemed to be so valuable
[02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:38.700]   that it should be a public good.
[02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:40.620]   - Yeah, I think so.
[02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:43.380]   I think that's a pretty good definition of success
[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:45.580]   that you work on a body of work
[02:32:45.580 --> 02:32:49.300]   and that body of work isn't just some commercial enterprise.
[02:32:49.300 --> 02:32:53.540]   It's a body of work that whatever commercial aspects
[02:32:53.540 --> 02:32:56.620]   or economic incentive aspects it might have,
[02:32:56.620 --> 02:32:58.660]   it eventually is so important
[02:32:58.660 --> 02:33:02.500]   that it becomes critical to how society functions.
[02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:06.780]   I'm personally quite lucky and grateful to be,
[02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:09.460]   in my opinion, working on something like that
[02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:13.100]   with an amazing team and an amazing community
[02:33:13.100 --> 02:33:15.340]   that seems to really very much care
[02:33:15.340 --> 02:33:20.260]   about this hybrid smart contract, transparent world
[02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:22.700]   that a lot of people in our industry,
[02:33:22.700 --> 02:33:25.620]   realistically, I think this is why a lot of them signed up.
[02:33:25.620 --> 02:33:27.460]   This is why I came into our industry.
[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:29.860]   It wasn't because Bitcoin,
[02:33:29.860 --> 02:33:34.140]   it was because Bitcoin was a picture
[02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:37.500]   of how the world could work in so many other ways.
[02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:39.220]   And that picture of how the world could work
[02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:43.460]   in so many other ways attracted me a very long time ago.
[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:49.100]   And I think that all of this stuff
[02:33:49.100 --> 02:33:51.100]   will eventually become a public good.
[02:33:51.100 --> 02:33:52.740]   I think it'll become so critical
[02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:56.300]   to how societies function internally and internationally
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:58.700]   that just like there are systems,
[02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:01.100]   like the Federal Reserve, like global payment systems,
[02:34:01.100 --> 02:34:02.580]   like all these types of things,
[02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:05.420]   I think eventually all of this technology
[02:34:05.420 --> 02:34:10.380]   will be baked into these societally critical systems.
[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:13.300]   And if I and our community and the people I work with
[02:34:13.300 --> 02:34:15.660]   and the body of work that we're working on
[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:18.940]   can make some kind of contribution to that shift
[02:34:18.940 --> 02:34:24.700]   towards a fair, economically fair, transparent society,
[02:34:25.780 --> 02:34:29.020]   from my point of view, it's a very worthwhile body of work.
[02:34:29.020 --> 02:34:32.220]   In terms of the show, you also mentioned the show.
[02:34:32.220 --> 02:34:36.380]   One of the shows that I really seem to like more and more
[02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:40.100]   for some reason is Star Trek, not the old Star Trek.
[02:34:40.100 --> 02:34:41.380]   I don't really get the old Star Trek.
[02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:43.340]   The special effects aren't good enough.
[02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:44.180]   (laughing)
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:47.300]   Star Trek, like The Next Generation and Voyager
[02:34:47.300 --> 02:34:50.260]   and Deep Space Nine and all those.
[02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:54.900]   I think whenever I happen to watch a Star Trek show again,
[02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:57.340]   I have a very simple conception in my mind
[02:34:57.340 --> 02:35:00.300]   that I really didn't have whenever I saw it way back when.
[02:35:00.300 --> 02:35:03.380]   It's that this is what the world looks like
[02:35:03.380 --> 02:35:07.020]   if technology takes us towards a utopia.
[02:35:07.020 --> 02:35:08.980]   So I think there's this fascinating thing
[02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:11.860]   where technology can take us towards a utopia
[02:35:11.860 --> 02:35:13.820]   or towards a dystopia.
[02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:18.140]   And in my mind, those kind of three Star Trek shows
[02:35:18.140 --> 02:35:23.140]   are a picture of what human civilization looks like
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:26.260]   if everybody's technological ambitions
[02:35:26.260 --> 02:35:28.540]   successfully take us towards a utopia.
[02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:30.940]   Because in the Star Trek universe,
[02:35:30.940 --> 02:35:34.220]   you're not seeking money or you're not seeking safety
[02:35:34.220 --> 02:35:36.140]   or you're not seeking,
[02:35:36.140 --> 02:35:38.540]   you're not really seeking anything for yourself.
[02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:42.060]   Everybody within Maslow's hierarchy of needs
[02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:44.060]   has gotten so many things for themselves
[02:35:44.060 --> 02:35:49.060]   that their goal is learning and discovering and/or helping.
[02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:53.300]   And I think there is this conception of human life
[02:35:53.300 --> 02:35:56.260]   once the baser needs are satisfied.
[02:35:56.260 --> 02:35:59.180]   And at the end of the day,
[02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:02.740]   I think that's what technology generally can elevate
[02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:04.540]   all of human civilization to.
[02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:07.460]   It can elevate us to Star Trek world
[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:10.500]   where if people want to invent,
[02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:12.140]   they can do that all day and nothing else.
[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:13.980]   If people wanna explore the stars,
[02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:15.020]   they can explore the stars
[02:36:15.020 --> 02:36:18.780]   and they don't have to worry about economic scarcity
[02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:21.220]   or any number of these other conceptions.
[02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:23.100]   So I don't know what the most impactful
[02:36:23.100 --> 02:36:24.780]   on me shows have been,
[02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:27.740]   but for some reason recently Star Trek
[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:30.020]   in the newer variant,
[02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:32.140]   not the most new Star Trek shows.
[02:36:32.140 --> 02:36:33.460]   Those shows are a little strange.
[02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:35.980]   The kind of middle Star Trek universe
[02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:37.980]   where everybody is doing something
[02:36:37.980 --> 02:36:40.540]   with a very important purpose
[02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:42.220]   and nobody's thinking about like,
[02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:46.060]   where's my paycheck or where's my whatever.
[02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:47.180]   They're all kind of like,
[02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:50.700]   we have to discover the formula to this
[02:36:50.700 --> 02:36:52.580]   to save the planet over there.
[02:36:52.580 --> 02:36:54.540]   And literally every episode you're discovering a formula
[02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:55.940]   to save a planet of some kind
[02:36:55.940 --> 02:36:58.620]   or a universe or ecosystem or whatever.
[02:36:58.620 --> 02:37:00.500]   And you're looking at it, you're like,
[02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:03.700]   you know, this is a pretty good place to end up.
[02:37:03.700 --> 02:37:05.420]   This is where we might wanna end up.
[02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:06.540]   - So it gives you hope.
[02:37:06.540 --> 02:37:11.540]   I mean, it's funny that we don't often think about the,
[02:37:11.540 --> 02:37:17.020]   I think it's very useful to think about positive visions
[02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:21.100]   of the future when we're trying to design technology.
[02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:25.220]   There's a lot of sort of in public discourse,
[02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:27.180]   a lot of people are thinking about
[02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:29.540]   kind of how everything goes wrong.
[02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:31.660]   It's important to think about that sometimes,
[02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:33.180]   but in moderation, I think,
[02:37:33.180 --> 02:37:35.500]   'cause there's not enough,
[02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:39.140]   in my little corner of artificial intelligence world,
[02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:42.940]   people are very kind of fear monger centered.
[02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:44.380]   There's a lot of discussions
[02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:46.180]   about how everything goes wrong.
[02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:47.540]   It's important to do,
[02:37:47.540 --> 02:37:50.100]   but it's also really important to talk about
[02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:53.460]   how things can go right,
[02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:56.260]   because we ultimately want to guide the design
[02:37:56.260 --> 02:37:59.140]   of the systems we create to make things right.
[02:37:59.140 --> 02:38:02.300]   And I think with hope and optimism,
[02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:06.060]   not naiveness, but optimism,
[02:38:06.060 --> 02:38:08.500]   you can actually create the better world.
[02:38:08.500 --> 02:38:10.880]   Like you have to think about a positive,
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:14.320]   a better world as you create,
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:16.320]   because then you can actually create it.
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:20.300]   Yeah, I'm one of the people that thinks that
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:24.780]   having an optimistic view of the world
[02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:26.860]   is better for design and creativity
[02:38:26.860 --> 02:38:28.860]   than having a pessimistic one.
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:30.940]   It's hard to design when you're in fear.
[02:38:30.940 --> 02:38:37.060]   Do you have advice for young people,
[02:38:37.060 --> 02:38:38.980]   speaking of being excited about
[02:38:38.980 --> 02:38:40.900]   and hopeful about the future world,
[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:43.860]   do you have advice for young people today
[02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:46.780]   in a computer science world,
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:48.920]   in software engineering world, in crypto world,
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:51.260]   but maybe in any world whatsoever,
[02:38:51.260 --> 02:38:55.240]   for life, how to pick a career
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:57.040]   or how to live life in general?
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:02.280]   - I think the thing that young people should do
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:04.140]   is not any one specific thing
[02:39:04.140 --> 02:39:07.420]   for any one specific young person.
[02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:08.860]   I think what they should do
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:11.920]   is what they won't be able to do
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:13.680]   in the later stages of their life.
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:16.200]   And the way, in my opinion,
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:19.560]   from a framework point of view to think about that,
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:23.360]   is that the amount of obligations
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:27.720]   and the amount of time that a person has
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:30.560]   seems to just diminish over time, right?
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:32.520]   So the amount of free time they have, right?
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:33.640]   So you start your job,
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:35.360]   you get a bunch of responsibilities,
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:38.600]   something with your partner, spouse, more responsibilities,
[02:39:38.600 --> 02:39:40.800]   kids, probably even more responsibilities,
[02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:43.840]   and soon enough, the time that you have
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:46.960]   to educate yourself, to travel,
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:50.160]   to experience the world however,
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:53.360]   create whatever creative endeavor you're interested in,
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:55.880]   slowly but surely disappears.
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:57.880]   I think this is something
[02:39:57.880 --> 02:40:01.040]   that young people don't fully realize.
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:04.320]   They assume that the world as it is now
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:07.480]   and the amount of free time that they have
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:11.360]   to travel, to educate themselves, to make new friends,
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:12.640]   to do all these things
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:16.760]   will somehow maybe diminish by 10%.
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:18.640]   It won't diminish by 10%.
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:20.800]   It'll diminish by 90%.
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:22.560]   And the 10% that you have,
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:26.000]   you'll be resting to get back to work and get things done.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.240]   So what I think young people should do,
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:32.680]   and this is why it's very different for each of them,
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:33.720]   I can't tell young people,
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:36.480]   "Hey, you should study philosophy, travel,
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:38.240]   and start your own enterprise
[02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:39.800]   to achieve something worthwhile in the world."
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:41.680]   That might be something that's good for me
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:45.480]   with my values and my kind of worldview,
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:47.880]   but for other people might be something else.
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:51.200]   I think the way that they should conceptualize it
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:56.200]   is imagine if over the next 10, 12 years,
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:02.240]   the amount of choice that you had about what you could do
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:04.440]   was cut down by 90%.
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:07.320]   What would you, and this is copying
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:10.760]   from this kind of Jeff Bezos regret minimization framework.
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:12.760]   In that framework, it's like,
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:16.080]   what would I regret not doing at 80?
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:19.440]   And that's kind of meant to create this long-term view
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:21.440]   and make these decisions now
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:23.880]   that'll get you to a long-term future
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:27.000]   that you can look back on and be proud of your life.
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:28.840]   What I think young people should do
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:30.560]   is they should say to themselves,
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:34.000]   "Look, if I never get the chance to travel
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.040]   for as long as I live,
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:41.040]   assuming that after 25, after 27, after 29, that's the case,
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:43.440]   how will I feel about that?
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:46.960]   If I never get to start a company after 25,
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:49.120]   after I get married, after I have kids,
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:51.000]   how will I feel about that?"
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.320]   And whatever they feel the worst about
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:54.880]   is what they should do.
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:57.080]   Whatever they feel like when they say to themselves,
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:01.400]   "You know, if I don't travel now, I will never travel."
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:02.920]   And they feel horrible about that.
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:06.000]   They just have an overwhelming fear
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.800]   and disgust at themselves in that type of state
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:14.640]   at 25, 27, 29, that's what they should do.
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:16.760]   And they shouldn't listen to anybody else.
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:20.960]   Let me put it to you this way.
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:24.600]   If you're really smart, you're gonna make it anyway.
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:26.400]   There's a lot of people putting a lot of pressure on you
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:28.600]   because they're afraid whether you're gonna make it.
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:31.320]   If you're really smart, you're gonna make it anyway.
[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:33.760]   If you're not really smart, you're screwed anyway.
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:34.600]   (laughing)
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:35.440]   So-
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:39.040]   - Either way, just relax with it and use your time well
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:43.120]   to do the things you would most regret not doing.
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:44.760]   That's really fascinating.
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:46.160]   - I wouldn't say relax.
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:50.400]   I would say very much cherish the free time,
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:52.680]   the discretionary time that you have
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:56.400]   from the age of 18 to maybe 25.
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:59.800]   Because at 25, everyone's gonna start looking at each other
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:02.280]   and asking, "What have I achieved?
[02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:04.560]   My friends have achieved, I haven't achieved."
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:06.240]   And then by the time you get to 30,
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:07.960]   you're gonna look at each other again and go,
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:12.960]   "Well, my friends have a family or a company or a PhD
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:14.520]   or a whatever, what do I have?"
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:16.080]   And the pressure will just increase.
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:20.080]   And it'll increase so much that even if you want to go
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:22.800]   and do the fun thing, it will not be fun
[02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:26.120]   because the pressure of comparing yourself
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:29.280]   to your friends at 25 or your peers at 30
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:33.600]   will be so great that it will no longer be normal
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:36.480]   for you to be in a hostel at 30,
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:38.960]   kind of like living it up, right?
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:42.440]   And this is why I also can't tell you
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:43.400]   specifically what it is.
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:46.040]   For me, it was getting an education in philosophy
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:47.800]   that was rigorous and in-depth.
[02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:50.320]   It was traveling and it was starting an enterprise
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:52.680]   that I thought that was worthwhile, that I directed,
[02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:54.360]   that I could make into something great.
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:55.640]   That's what it was for me.
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:58.080]   For other people, it might be something with a band,
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:43:59.920]   it might be something with painting,
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:02.360]   it might be an education.
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:04.840]   You, by the way, also should not assume
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:09.840]   that your ability to get an education will improve.
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:13.240]   All of those responsibilities will take away
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:15.520]   your ability to get an education.
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:17.560]   So if you value having an education,
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:22.040]   if you value being a deeply educated, well-rounded person
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:25.360]   with a wide array of knowledge on a wide array of topics,
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:28.960]   capitalism will force you to specialize.
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:30.000]   That's what it's good at.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000]   It's going to take you, it's going to fashion you
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:35.400]   into a very specific tool for most people,
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:37.840]   into a very specific set of tasks.
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:41.560]   If you want to have an education in something, get it now.
[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:44.120]   If you want to travel somewhere, travel there now.
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:46.400]   If you want to do some kind of creative endeavor
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:49.560]   that you doubt whether you'll have time for in the future,
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:50.480]   do it now.
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:52.320]   You won't have time for it in the future.
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:55.320]   You won't have time to read philosophy books all day,
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:56.400]   unfortunately.
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:00.240]   You won't have time to fly to Italy
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:02.720]   and kind of hang out with people.
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:04.720]   If you're serious about your life,
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:06.120]   you're going to get more responsibilities.
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:08.000]   You're going to get more stuff to do.
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.520]   And so my advice to you is do not piss away
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:15.120]   this rare, unique, discretionary time.
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:18.720]   And if your friends are, get new friends.
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:20.240]   Get smarter friends.
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:23.840]   Get people who are using the limited time they have better.
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:25.920]   That's my advice.
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:27.960]   - So it's just a quickly comment.
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:29.240]   It's brilliant.
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:31.480]   You know, to reframe high school
[02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:34.120]   and undergraduate college education,
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:37.400]   sometimes people want to quickly get it over with.
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:42.400]   But one thing I remember thinking,
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:45.480]   and it's very true about high school,
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:48.120]   is one of the only times in your life
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:51.280]   you'll get a chance to truly get a broad education.
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:53.820]   You don't often think of it that way,
[02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:57.160]   but it's a chance to really enjoy learning things
[02:45:57.160 --> 02:45:58.720]   that are outside of the specialty
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:00.480]   that you'll eventually end up with.
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:02.280]   And that's how college education is.
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:05.640]   And on a more fun side, I played music.
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:07.960]   I did martial arts,
[02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:10.720]   and we offline mentioned played video games.
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:14.120]   I find it fascinating and brilliant what you said,
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:17.440]   which is the world will not give you a chance
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:19.720]   to truly enjoy many of these things
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:22.680]   and truly get value from many of those things
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:25.540]   once you get older.
[02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:29.420]   I find it exceptionally difficult to enjoy video games now.
[02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:30.260]   - There's so much stuff to do.
[02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:31.720]   There's so much responsibility.
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:37.260]   - And at the time when I played Elder Scrolls
[02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:39.900]   and Baldur's Gate and Diablo II,
[02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:44.440]   and at the time I thought maybe that was a waste of time.
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:49.100]   But now looking back, I realize,
[02:46:49.100 --> 02:46:50.500]   'cause I always thought, you know,
[02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:52.140]   let me get the career first,
[02:46:52.140 --> 02:46:54.100]   and then I'll have a chance to play video games.
[02:46:54.100 --> 02:46:55.620]   That's the way I was thinking.
[02:46:55.620 --> 02:46:57.100]   You know, it was a waste of time
[02:46:57.100 --> 02:47:01.120]   because I should really progress on the career,
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:03.160]   and then I'll have time to play video games.
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:06.160]   No, the reality is that was really fulfilling.
[02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:10.560]   Those are some of the happiest travel experiences
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:14.080]   of my life is me traveling to those virtual worlds
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:15.680]   and spending time in them.
[02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:16.860]   And it was really fulfilling,
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:19.140]   and they stayed with me for the rest of my life.
[02:47:19.140 --> 02:47:21.840]   And I get to experience echoes of that
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:23.400]   when I play video games these days
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:25.240]   for an hour here, an hour there,
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:27.820]   like one hour a month or something like that.
[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:30.920]   But even those experiences, as silly as they are,
[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:33.420]   they seem like a waste of time at the time,
[02:47:33.420 --> 02:47:37.020]   enjoying them fully, unapologetically.
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:41.120]   And in a framework exactly as you said,
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:43.780]   would I regret being the kind of person
[02:47:43.780 --> 02:47:46.520]   who've never played those video games?
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:50.120]   And I can, for myself, honestly say that yes.
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:54.680]   Look, when I'm on my deathbed, I'm glad I-
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:55.520]   - Play Baldur's Gate.
[02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:57.400]   - Yeah, I build Baldur's Gate 2
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:48:00.960]   and all those Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind,
[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:03.620]   and all the Elder Scroll games.
[02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:08.620]   And yeah, the things that don't necessarily fit
[02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:12.300]   into this kind of storyline
[02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:14.480]   of what a career is supposed to be,
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:16.440]   travel and all those experiences that you mentioned.
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:20.000]   - I think I'd just like to say one final quick thing on this.
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:24.000]   I think this extends to really hard things as well.
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:25.800]   It extends to the things you wanna do,
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:28.760]   but one of the best pieces of advice one of my mentors
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:32.720]   gave me early on in my career around this time
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:35.380]   is that it will actually become harder
[02:48:35.380 --> 02:48:38.760]   to start a company as you get older.
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:41.360]   Once again, because you have more responsibilities.
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:44.280]   You're responsible to your partner for some kind of income
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:45.720]   to create a life together.
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:47.160]   Once you have kids, you're responsible
[02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:50.320]   for an even greater income to create a life for kids.
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:53.300]   And startups do not generate income, right?
[02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:56.040]   They take many, many years before anything happens.
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:57.400]   People are getting evicted.
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:48:59.160]   People are eating ramen noodles.
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:02.160]   That is a thing that happens, that will happen.
[02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:05.920]   So I'm not saying that you should do the fun things
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:07.360]   or the enjoyable things.
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:12.200]   I'm saying the things that you would regret not doing,
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:17.200]   that you can uniquely do in the time span from 18 to 25.
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:22.360]   Which one of which is, if you plan to have a family
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:24.680]   and start a family when you're 25,
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:26.840]   you should start a company now.
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:29.460]   You should not wait until a bunch of people depend on you
[02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:32.120]   for income to eat, to start a company.
[02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:34.720]   The amount of pressure that will be on you at that point
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:36.480]   will be monumental.
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:39.200]   You should start a company when nobody depends on you
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:42.680]   and you can sleep on the floor, eating ramen noodles
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:45.060]   and still have a great time and show up
[02:49:45.060 --> 02:49:47.720]   with a lot of enthusiasm and be excited.
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:52.720]   So I just mean whatever you want to really devote yourself
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:56.200]   to and really do, don't put it off.
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:49:59.080]   Don't go to consulting or banking or any other industry
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:00.600]   and say, I'm gonna do this for three years
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:02.080]   and I'll get experience.
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:04.680]   The only way you get experience is by doing something.
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:07.440]   You go, you do it, you fail, you do it again and again
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:08.680]   and again and again and again.
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:10.760]   And then you have experience and then you can do it right.
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:12.400]   That's the only way experience happens.
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:14.760]   There is no other way short of mentorship.
[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:16.280]   If you're lucky to get mentorship,
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:18.800]   99% of people don't get mentorship.
[02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:20.680]   - And even though we're talking about young people,
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:21.820]   I feel like you're speaking to me.
[02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:24.760]   As somebody who spent the last two weeks
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:27.040]   sleeping on the floor 'cause there's no mattress
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:29.360]   and somebody who is single and somebody who's thinking
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:32.800]   about doing a startup, I felt like you were speaking to me
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:34.800]   as a fellow young person.
[02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:40.680]   Let me ask you about this whole life of ours
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:43.160]   to zoom out on the big philosophical question,
[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:44.520]   the ridiculous question.
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:46.680]   What do you think is the meaning of it all?
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:49.320]   Do you think about this kind of stuff
[02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:51.920]   as you're creating all the technology,
[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:54.520]   as you're thinking about this future?
[02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:57.160]   You ever zoom out and think like, why?
[02:50:57.160 --> 02:50:59.860]   Why are you, Sergey, striving?
[02:50:59.860 --> 02:51:04.860]   Why are we, the human species, striving for the stars?
[02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:08.880]   - So I think it comes down to whether people
[02:51:08.880 --> 02:51:10.260]   wanna live in society.
[02:51:10.260 --> 02:51:14.980]   So if people decide to be part of society,
[02:51:14.980 --> 02:51:19.980]   they have a certain set of conditions
[02:51:19.980 --> 02:51:21.920]   that they decide to take part in.
[02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:27.600]   So I think what this comes down to is a lot of
[02:51:27.600 --> 02:51:30.320]   really involved conversations,
[02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:33.040]   but if we assume people have free will and choice,
[02:51:33.040 --> 02:51:35.280]   we just kind of make that blanket assumption,
[02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:37.600]   then the question starts to become,
[02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:39.200]   well, what choices do we make
[02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:41.900]   and how do we live with those choices?
[02:51:41.900 --> 02:51:44.640]   And I think probably the most fundamental choice
[02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:47.560]   is whether we exist in a society
[02:51:47.560 --> 02:51:49.840]   or we choose to leave society.
[02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:50.860]   And there are people that do this.
[02:51:50.860 --> 02:51:52.000]   There are people that go live in the woods.
[02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:55.080]   There are people that immigrate to other societies
[02:51:55.080 --> 02:51:56.960]   and they make a choice, right?
[02:51:56.960 --> 02:51:58.840]   And as they enter those other societies
[02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:01.840]   or they choose to leave society and go live in the woods,
[02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:05.960]   they adopt a certain set of values, right?
[02:52:05.960 --> 02:52:08.400]   They adopt values that the society prescribes,
[02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:09.680]   they compromise their own values,
[02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:11.000]   they define their own values,
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.760]   and they create a set of values for themselves, right?
[02:52:13.760 --> 02:52:18.080]   I think at the end of the day,
[02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:20.980]   if you're going to choose to live in society,
[02:52:20.980 --> 02:52:24.680]   in addition to all the minimums of, you know,
[02:52:24.680 --> 02:52:27.040]   not throwing garbage on the floor and, you know,
[02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:29.640]   doing nice things for people that need help
[02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:31.960]   and doing any number of things to just be
[02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:34.680]   a normal human being within society,
[02:52:34.680 --> 02:52:37.160]   you have to ask yourself,
[02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:39.920]   what am I doing as part of society, right?
[02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:42.680]   You can always say, hey, I'm going to leave society,
[02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:43.720]   I'm going to live in the woods.
[02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:44.760]   I did that, right?
[02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:47.000]   I went and I lived in the woods and I gave it a shot,
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.800]   realized a ton of stuff, huge amount of clarity from that.
[02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:52.800]   But when you decide to live in society,
[02:52:52.800 --> 02:52:57.560]   you take on, first of all, certain minimal agreements,
[02:52:57.560 --> 02:53:01.120]   you mold your values a little bit to that society,
[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:04.040]   that's another choice that people inherently make.
[02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:07.200]   And then there's a question of,
[02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:09.020]   well, what am I doing here, right?
[02:53:09.020 --> 02:53:11.080]   What am I doing in society, right?
[02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:13.060]   So when people say the meaning of life,
[02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:13.900]   I don't know what the meaning of life is.
[02:53:13.900 --> 02:53:16.580]   - What's the meaning of life in society?
[02:53:16.580 --> 02:53:18.480]   - Right, what's the meaning of life for the choice
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:20.580]   that you've made within society, right?
[02:53:20.580 --> 02:53:23.380]   'Cause that's maybe the first fundamental choice you made.
[02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:25.560]   You made a choice and you continue to make a choice
[02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:30.560]   to be part of society and a specific society, right?
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:34.160]   So you've made this choice, you're part of a society,
[02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:39.160]   and now you kind of have a life
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:40.760]   and you have people around you.
[02:53:40.760 --> 02:53:44.560]   And then the question is, in my opinion,
[02:53:44.560 --> 02:53:46.860]   the question is what is the body of work
[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:50.160]   that you want to make, right?
[02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:54.080]   I think personally that life is kind of so short
[02:53:55.120 --> 02:53:57.800]   and the ability to get enough resources for yourself
[02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:01.440]   in at least the developed markets where we're lucky to be in
[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:06.440]   is so relatively abundant that we, you and me,
[02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:09.880]   have the luxury, by your pursuit of a PhD,
[02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:12.880]   you've had this luxury, I've had this luxury
[02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:14.960]   through the work that I've been doing
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:18.540]   to pursue something that makes society better.
[02:54:18.540 --> 02:54:24.720]   So this is kind of the question, I would say,
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:28.280]   the question is, am I gonna live in society, yes or no?
[02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:30.200]   Yes, okay, most people choose yes.
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:31.600]   I understand why to a degree,
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:33.480]   I understand why some people choose no.
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:36.520]   And then what is the, and I'm gonna be in society,
[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:38.320]   I'm gonna, if you choose to be in society,
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:40.240]   you're just choosing to abide by the rules,
[02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:42.640]   you're choosing to just do the minimum, right?
[02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:44.380]   That's what being part of society means.
[02:54:44.380 --> 02:54:45.840]   People that choose to be part of society
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:48.000]   but don't wanna do this, it's very confusing,
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:49.520]   they should just leave, they should just go,
[02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:52.600]   look, I don't like this deal, I'm gonna go somewhere else.
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:55.080]   I'm gonna live in Tibet, I'm gonna live in the woods,
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:57.920]   I'm gonna live wherever where the rules are to my liking.
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:54:58.740]   Right?
[02:54:58.740 --> 02:55:02.240]   You've chosen to be in society.
[02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:04.280]   Next question, kind of final question is,
[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:07.280]   what is the body of work that I'm gonna be involved in?
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:09.280]   Because in looking at that Jeff Bezos
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:12.080]   kind of regret minimization framework thing,
[02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:14.280]   I think that's what a lot of it really comes down to,
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:16.960]   is you kind of, the framework is at 80 years old,
[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:17.960]   you look back over your life,
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:19.520]   what would you regret not doing?
[02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:21.640]   What would you regret not pursuing?
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:24.880]   I think there are a number of things
[02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:26.800]   on a personal level each person has,
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:29.460]   but I think, at least for me,
[02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:32.400]   and probably for many of the other people I know,
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:35.480]   there's a question of, what is the body of work
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:36.960]   that I was involved in?
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:38.400]   What did I do?
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:39.640]   What happened?
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:41.140]   Right, what was I involved in?
[02:55:41.140 --> 02:55:47.400]   And in my opinion, you should have a good answer to that.
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:50.720]   - And you mentioned the body of work in relation to
[02:55:51.720 --> 02:55:54.760]   whether it helped make a better world.
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:58.280]   And the fundamental question there is,
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:00.120]   what does better mean?
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:03.920]   So it's our striving to understand what is better.
[02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:08.920]   What kind of world would we love to exist after we're gone?
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:12.040]   And I think that's another thing,
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:13.600]   almost unanswerable question,
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:16.440]   but it's one we can strive towards,
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:18.300]   is what is a better world?
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.560]   - Right, I think that's, once again,
[02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:23.840]   that's a very personal question.
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:26.240]   I'm not sure if there's an objective moral truth
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:28.480]   that's gonna suddenly give us all an answer.
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:30.540]   I think it's actually quite fascinating to me
[02:56:30.540 --> 02:56:32.600]   when people feel they have this objective moral truth,
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:34.600]   they're so sure in their opinions,
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:37.120]   this is what we do, we should go hurt them,
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:41.080]   or help them, or kill them, or rescue them, or whatever.
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:44.320]   There's all these kind of very situational specific,
[02:56:44.320 --> 02:56:46.560]   kind of like, this is the right thing to do,
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:49.960]   the objective moral truth told me that this is it.
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:51.960]   - But maybe there's a definitive truth
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:56.360]   that we can arrive towards, sort of a consensus
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:56:59.680]   of what that is within the little local pocket
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:01.400]   of society that you're in.
[02:57:01.400 --> 02:57:02.240]   - Yeah, that's the point.
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:04.360]   - That's what happens, people just then mislabel it
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:06.520]   and they go like, objective moral truth.
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:09.280]   This is not our idea.
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:10.760]   This is coming up from on high here.
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:14.000]   This is the objective moral truth
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:18.640]   that I think exists in some metaphysical form somewhere.
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:20.520]   - And then you build a building with marble
[02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:22.880]   and it's big and usually what happens?
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:23.940]   And then you convince yourself
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:24.780]   that that building represents objective truth.
[02:57:24.780 --> 02:57:26.440]   - I think those people actually,
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:27.920]   the people who build those buildings
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:30.280]   probably understand that there is no metaphysical objective.
[02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:32.640]   They're just like, we're all just coming to consensus.
[02:57:32.640 --> 02:57:33.680]   I'm gonna build the biggest building
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:35.840]   and you're like me and that's what we're gonna do, right?
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:37.960]   They just look at it that way probably.
[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:43.080]   I think what ends up happening with all these values
[02:57:43.080 --> 02:57:45.080]   is yeah, people should determine that for themselves.
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:47.320]   I agree that there's a second order question here
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:50.300]   of what is the best body of work to work on.
[02:57:50.300 --> 02:57:53.580]   Personally, I think that's probably a mix
[02:57:53.580 --> 02:57:56.080]   of what could you realistically achieve?
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:59.120]   Is that gonna have an impact on society
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:00.200]   that you feel good about?
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:01.560]   - Yeah. - Right?
[02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:04.800]   So these are probably the two aspects of this question
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:07.200]   and is this gonna have a good impact on society
[02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:08.200]   that you feel good about?
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:09.820]   Obviously very subjective, right?
[02:58:09.820 --> 02:58:12.520]   Some people save animals, some people save forests.
[02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:16.280]   We and I are creating this system
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:19.160]   of economic fairness and transparency.
[02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:22.960]   I feel that I'm in a good position to enable that.
[02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:25.740]   I feel that I have a good chance of succeeding at that.
[02:58:25.740 --> 02:58:29.160]   And I think that the impact will be quite meaningful
[02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:30.760]   for a large number of people.
[02:58:30.760 --> 02:58:34.840]   And so I'm completely happy to look back once I'm 80
[02:58:34.840 --> 02:58:37.400]   and see a body of work that achieved that
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:38.600]   and be very proud of that, right?
[02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:40.520]   Because I think that's what I'll be doing
[02:58:40.520 --> 02:58:42.180]   when I'm looking back.
[02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:43.080]   - Well, I agree with you.
[02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:48.080]   The scale of impact as a hybrid smart contracts,
[02:58:48.080 --> 02:58:50.800]   this whole idea that you're working on
[02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:55.400]   has a potential to transform the world for the better
[02:58:55.400 --> 02:59:00.400]   at a scale that I can't even imagine.
[02:59:00.400 --> 02:59:03.760]   So speaking of which, means even more
[02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:05.920]   that you would waste so many hours
[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:07.560]   of that exciting life with me.
[02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:09.200]   Thank you so much for talking today, Sergey.
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:11.360]   This is a really fascinating conversation,
[02:59:11.360 --> 02:59:13.100]   a really fascinating space,
[02:59:13.100 --> 02:59:14.720]   and I can't wait to learn more.
[02:59:14.720 --> 02:59:17.080]   So thank you so much for talking today.
[02:59:17.080 --> 02:59:17.920]   - Thank you for having me.
[02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:20.020]   It's been an absolute pleasure.
[02:59:20.020 --> 02:59:21.580]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:59:21.580 --> 02:59:22.920]   with Sergey Nazarov.
[02:59:22.920 --> 02:59:26.340]   And thank you to Wine Access, Athletic Greens,
[02:59:26.340 --> 02:59:29.820]   Magic Spoon, Indeed, and BetterHelp.
[02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:33.540]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[02:59:33.540 --> 02:59:37.100]   And now let me leave you with some words from Copernicus.
[02:59:37.100 --> 02:59:39.580]   To know that we know what we know
[02:59:39.580 --> 02:59:43.180]   and to know that we do not know what we do not know,
[02:59:43.180 --> 02:59:45.680]   that is true knowledge.
[02:59:45.680 --> 02:59:48.380]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:59:48.380 --> 02:59:50.960]   (upbeat music)
[02:59:50.960 --> 02:59:53.540]   (upbeat music)
