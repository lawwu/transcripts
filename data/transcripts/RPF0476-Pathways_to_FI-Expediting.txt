[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.840]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we're going to talk about pathways to independence
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.640]   and I'm going to share with you how you can turn a simple straightforward job of an expediter
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   into a strong foundation for financial freedom.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:01:05.400]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.040]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.340]   My name is Joshua and I am your host today.
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.720]   An example of that tagline, I'm just going to talk to you about how you can take a very
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   simple job working as an expediter, a driver of an expedited truck and do expedited shipping
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.720]   and turn that into financial freedom in short order.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.720]   Last few days I just returned from watching the eclipse up in the 100% band in Florida,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.720]   the eclipse on Monday.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.440]   It took me a little bit longer to get home and get back to work than I imagined.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.520]   I thought I had planned for the traffic but the traffic was terrible.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.680]   It was a remarkable experience though to be there watching the eclipse.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.680]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.520]   I hope that many of you took time out of your schedule and planned for it.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.040]   It's certainly an unusual occurrence and definitely an enjoyable experience to be there in the
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.720]   100% band and to see the total eclipse of the sun.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720]   Really, really remarkable.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.160]   While I was there, I happened to sit down at a cafe and I sat down and started talking
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   to this young man at the cafe and we talked about his job.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160]   He works as something called an expediter.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.240]   Now, if you're not familiar with expediting or expedited shipping, an expediter is in
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.160]   essence a trucker.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.520]   But unlike a trucker who drives a larger truck, a larger semi truck or even a larger box truck,
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.040]   an expediter drives a smaller van, a cargo van.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.520]   Because the expediter drives a cargo van, they are not subject to the same DOT, Department
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.480]   of Transportation regulations that truckers are subject to.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.480]   This is of great value and attractiveness to people who need to ship things quickly.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.800]   It may be somebody may need to ship a pallet of goods or a couple of pallets of goods.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.760]   Usually these large cargo vans can fit three pallets, some of them two, but usually three
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   pallets.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.480]   They call them skids, three skids in the back.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.000]   So that allows somebody to ship a decent volume of goods.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.200]   Or it may be somebody who just needs a certain part.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.880]   Maybe there's an oil rig in Texas that needs a part shipped down from Illinois or any number
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.240]   of things that can be needed.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.440]   Because the expediters are not subject to the DOT regulations on having to stop and
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   be weighed, as an example, they can make time more quickly.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.700]   They can usually drive a little bit faster and they're not subject to the regulations
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.080]   involving how much truckers are required to sleep.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.700]   If you're not familiar, the Department of Transportation puts a limit on how many hours
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.440]   continuously a truck driver can operate their vehicle.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.200]   And so because of that, unless there's a team driving a large semi truck, they have to stop
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.720]   and take certain legally prescribed amounts of rest.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.320]   And so that's the world of expediting trucking.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.000]   They take smaller quantities of cargo across the country very quickly, across the state,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   across the country.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.560]   They're shippers on custom jobs.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.960]   I've had an interest in this because I have various weird interests like this and I've
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.000]   hung out quite a bit on some of the expediters' forums, looking around at what they do.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.040]   And I was intrigued with how they make their business, how they accomplish their lifestyle.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.760]   And just – I've always – it's been one of my interests.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.160]   But this was the first time I've actually sat down and talked with somebody.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.080]   Now usually the expediters, if you don't know what – if you know what to look for,
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.200]   you'll see them everywhere.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.720]   But basically they usually will drive a large white cargo van of some kind.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.280]   You can almost always see a couple of them at a truck stop.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.880]   You'll just see a white cargo van parked in a parking space.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.400]   A lot of times you'll see them at a Walmart or other places as well.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.640]   And the reason that they're parked is because usually they're waiting on their next job.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.120]   The life and lifestyle of an expediter is very unique because generally they're on
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.920]   the road from – on one-way shipments.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.520]   They don't necessarily work regular routes.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.640]   They just simply respond to the call and go wherever their shipment calls them to be.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.280]   And then in between jobs, they'll be resting.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.880]   Most of the time they will stay in their vehicle.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.840]   They'll either rig up a little bed sometimes right behind the front two driver seats, a
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   little bed.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.560]   Or this particular man that I was talking to, he was driving a sprinter van that had
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.160]   – it was a chassis cab, a sprinter van with a box on the back.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.360]   And then he had a little bunk up above the cab that he could sleep in when he needed
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.140]   to just pull over and stay in a bed.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.240]   So you'll see them resting.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:04.120]   And the job is unique because it is one of these live on the job types of jobs.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.480]   And that's why I'm going to use it as an example to talk about how you can use a
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.640]   job like this to launch you towards financial freedom in a very short order.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.320]   There are a number of different jobs like this where you actually live in the same place
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.640]   that you work.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.600]   Of course, trucking or truck driving is certainly one example of that, whether it's a larger
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.200]   truck or a smaller truck.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.360]   The man that I'm talking to, his name is John.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.800]   John was – basically was living in his van.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.360]   He had been doing this work for about three months.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.960]   He had had an apartment for a short time and then he got rid of his apartment and he lives
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.200]   in the van full time.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.040]   Young man, perhaps early 20s, he lives in the van.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.880]   So when he's not taking a load from one place to another, he has free time to sleep
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.520]   or to go and do sightseeing or do anything that he wants to do.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.800]   But this is not the only job that's like that.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.840]   You could go and work on an oil rig or have a friend that worked in a commercial Alaska
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.320]   ship – fishing operation one time, things like that.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.760]   There are many variations of this where you can go and do work where you live.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.480]   You're a mercenary and you go and do soldiering for hire or work for a contractor in Iraq,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.840]   these types of things.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:29.680]   The benefits of this type of work is you can earn moderate to high wages and have, if you
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.580]   play your cards right, almost no living expenses.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:44.560]   This opens up a real opportunity for normal people without extraordinary education, extraordinary
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.480]   training, extraordinary skills.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:56.840]   It opens up the opportunity for normal people to break free if you play your cards right.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.760]   Many of these types of jobs don't require a high level of skill or at least not to start
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   with.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.960]   Certainly, in time, you're going to need a high level of skill if you're working
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.300]   on an oil rig or driving a crab boat or some similar operation.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:19.240]   But there are often opportunities for people without those developed skills to start.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.800]   If you're careful, because of the fact that your expenses are so low, you've got a real
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   opportunity.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.060]   Today, I want to tell you how – just some ideas on how you can leverage a few years
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.820]   of this type of work to open up a very bright future.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.120]   I told John as I was sitting having breakfast with him, I told him I was going to do this
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.120]   show for him.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.360]   I'm not going to go on your ideas specifically, but other listeners, of course, here are ideas
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.520]   that you can take and you can apply them to your situation.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.360]   So here's my advice.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:57.800]   Number one, you must view this type of venture as a temporary, temporary thing.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:04.160]   There are – there is a small percentage of society, a small number of people who would
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.200]   like to do these types of things on the long term.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.020]   There are some people who enjoy being alone.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.200]   There are some people who enjoy this type of work on the long term.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:21.160]   But for most of us, this type of work where you are going to be away, away from your family,
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.040]   away from your friends, doing hard physical work and you're living and working on the
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.240]   job, this is something that's best viewed on a temporary basis.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.200]   Certainly, this is most ideally suited to people who are single.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:40.120]   I would strongly discourage any person who is married or who has children from engaging
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.920]   in this type of work.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.480]   Almost no marriage would be able to survive work like this, whether it's somebody who's
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.400]   an on-the-road truck driver, somebody who's in the military.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.920]   Almost no marriage can survive circumstances like this.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.680]   If you lose your marriage over your job, the price and the cost is just simply far too
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.000]   high.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.520]   There is no amount of money that will make it worth it.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.360]   So this type of approach is best suited for somebody who is single and who can go and
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.800]   engage in hard work.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.120]   But it's best to view this as temporary.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.960]   Here's your first layer of advantage because most people who do this type of work are not
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.920]   thinking all that far down the road.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.080]   In general, very few people labor with a vision.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.800]   Very few people think more than for this weekend or for the end of the month or for the end
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   of the year.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.600]   So if you're someone who can see beyond that, that puts you far ahead.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:38.400]   But when you get into simple, usually menial or repetitive work like this, then the field
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.700]   narrows even farther and it's very rare to find somebody who's a long-term thinker in
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.040]   a job or an approach like this.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.920]   But this is not for you.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.240]   You can labor at this with a long-time perspective.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.120]   This will dramatically affect how you use your money.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   It will allow you to take advantage of the savings opportunity by not expanding your
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.280]   lifestyle and spending money on stupid stuff.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.600]   Many people who are in this type of work make a series of unfortunate decisions where they
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.160]   buy unnecessary things that suck up all of their earnings.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:20.160]   It's not unusual to find a young, low-ranking person in the military who has a big, beautiful
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.720]   $40,000 pickup truck outside.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.520]   Their entire opportunity to save money because the military can cover their housing is blown
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.560]   because of the truck outside.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.720]   It's not unusual to find people with serious bad habits that suck up all of their money.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.160]   It's not unusual to find that.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.960]   But it's not required.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.720]   If you view this as temporary and you view this type of work as giving you a foundation
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.440]   that's going to set you financially free for the rest of your life, you have a real opportunity
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.440]   to make a big difference.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.680]   So view it as temporary and deal with the temporary pain.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.840]   Deal with the temporary discomfort.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.200]   Deal with the temporary frustration and keep your expenses low so that you can fully reap
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.800]   the benefits of this job.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.160]   Number two, enjoy the benefits of the work now.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.940]   Many people who are working in a job like this are not thinking of the benefits.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.560]   They only focus on the hard times.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.760]   That's what I really enjoyed about talking with a young man, John, who I met this weekend
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.840]   or this week.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.440]   He was – he'd only been doing this for a few months.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.320]   He was from Tennessee and he was enjoying the opportunity to travel the country.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.400]   Even in three short months, he'd driven across 38 states and he was looking forward to being
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.960]   able to take shipments up to Canada as well and drive across Canada when he had the opportunity.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:44.160]   So for somebody who wants to travel, you can do that in the context of a job.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.860]   But you'll only get the benefits of it if you see it as an opportunity and you focus
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.440]   on the benefits of that job.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.100]   John was planning to buy a nice camera.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.400]   He enjoys photography, enjoys hiking.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.780]   So when he was on duty, he would go and deliver a load.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.600]   When he was in a place he was interested in seeing, he would ask his boss for a day off
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.680]   and he would then just take his van, very mobile.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.400]   He's not trying to drive an 18-wheeler through a national park.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.900]   He could take his van and go and visit some great site that he would be interested in
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.360]   seeing and interested in photographing.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.520]   There are lots of benefits of this type of work that if you focus on, you can really
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.740]   enjoy.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.320]   Maybe the benefit of travel.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.160]   Maybe the benefit of being able to be outside and enjoy beautiful weather.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.680]   It may be the benefit of doing hard physical work that makes you strong.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:36.520]   It may be the benefit of doing work that is hard and forges character in you.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.360]   Or maybe it's the benefit of an adventure.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.160]   You're working as a contractor, a military contractor in Iraq.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.880]   Well, maybe you just say it's an adventure, an opportunity to learn Arabic or some version
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.880]   of it.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.800]   But count the blessings and enjoy the benefits of it knowing that it's going to be temporary
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.920]   and embrace it with an attitude of adventure, an adventurous spirit.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:05.600]   Number three, when you're doing this type of work, stack the cash and wait.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.560]   Do as close to nothing as practically possible.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.800]   Don't feel like you've got to make long-term decisions quickly.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.900]   One of the great opportunities about this type of work is it can be done usually by
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.640]   somebody who has no starting pay.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.840]   For example, the guy that I was talking to, John, the expediter, shared with me how the
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.340]   financial arrangements of his operation with his boss works.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.700]   His boss owns the trucks, owns the vans that his employees drive.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.080]   The boss coordinates the loads, is connected with the opportunity to bid on people who
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.040]   want to make these types of last-minute shipments.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:50.960]   His boss owns the van and handles the maintenance on the van and takes 40% of the price of the
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:57.560]   shipment and the driver keeps 60% of the price of the shipment and pays for fuel and expenses
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.680]   along the way.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.000]   This seems like a very fair arrangement.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.760]   John was very pleased with it, but it means that you can start with nothing.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.560]   Somebody else owns a van and you just simply do the work and you can pile up money.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:17.120]   Many times, this may be the first time that someone in this situation has had a chance
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.880]   to pile up money, any even substantial money.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:27.960]   And unfortunately, without our making firm decisions to get used to having large amounts
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.600]   of money, it starts to burn a hole in our pockets.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.440]   Don't let this happen to you.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:43.600]   Resolve not to spend money in the short term and not to make any kind of long-term decisions
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.640]   for what you should do with the money until you pile up a lot of it.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.880]   Just stack the cash and wait.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.880]   Go through the entire season.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.820]   Work out the entire contract.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.960]   Do a couple of years and don't be scared to just simply put the money in the bank and
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.040]   wait.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:09.640]   It takes time to train yourself to be comfortable having large amounts of money on hand.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:16.240]   And it takes time to train yourself to think like somebody who has large amounts of money
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.920]   on hand.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.980]   Far too many people get nervous about the fact that for the first time in their life
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:28.120]   they have 10 or 15 or 20 or $50,000 in the bank and all of a sudden they feel like they
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.840]   got to do something.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.760]   And their friend wants to start a business and they say, "Here, I got 20 grand."
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.680]   And they all of a sudden start investing.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.880]   Take time and stack the cash.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.440]   In just a moment, I'm going to give you a bunch of things you can do with the money
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.440]   and they'll be very diverse.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:52.240]   But the unifying thread is you have to have the money ready to go.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:59.940]   Number four, use this time in your life to educate yourself about things that matter
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.660]   to you.
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:08.860]   Use this time to educate yourself and don't waste it.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.660]   Depending on the nature of your work, you'll have different opportunities for education.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:18.320]   If you're working as a driver, driving a van across the country as an expediter, you'll
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.180]   have plenty of time to listen to audio materials.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.460]   So set aside a budget and buy good quality audio books that are going to teach you about
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.960]   the things that you need to know about.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.640]   Find and subscribe to relevant podcasts.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:37.540]   Find and subscribe to the appropriate iTunes U channels of learning.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.460]   Go ahead and figure out a plan so that you can get those videos on courses, buy the great
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:46.580]   courses or download the videos and get them tuned into your sound system so that you can
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.700]   learn and take those college classes while you're driving.
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.340]   You can do a tremendous amount of learning with audio.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.180]   You may not be able to take detailed copious notes on audio as you drive, but you'll certainly
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.800]   retain some of it.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:06.420]   You may retain 30%, but 30% of 50 or 60 hours of driving is a lot of learning.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.580]   So do an assessment of the types of things that you need to learn in order to advance
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:17.700]   yourself towards the things that you're interested in and start listening.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:22.740]   Other jobs may not involve time for listening, but if you're working on an oil pipeline up
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.820]   in Alaska or you're out on a rig at sea, you're going to have lots of time to read.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:34.220]   Instead of wasting your time goofing off online, dedicate yourself to serious reading in your
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.180]   fields of interest.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.660]   Become knowledgeable and expert, become an expert in the things that you care about.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:47.340]   Take the time to pursue formal certifications, formal credentials.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:52.740]   There are all kinds of colleges and universities that you can go through and do your work via
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.460]   correspondence study.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:01.180]   Work by a correspondence study is a time-honored technique of learning.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.260]   One of my grandfathers did this.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:08.380]   He worked on a small cattle ranch up in the mountains of Colorado and he – I forget
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.460]   which degree or maybe it was my grandmother got a teaching certificate.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.940]   I forget which degree but wound up finishing his academic coursework in a college degree
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.740]   through long-distance correspondence study.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:24.020]   Went on and got a master's in chemistry and became a college professor.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:29.300]   But it started with him studying at the kitchen table late in the evening on a little ranch
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.020]   up in the mountains.
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.340]   When you add on the accessibility of the internet, it is so much easier today.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.680]   So get the books, get the courses and get the degree.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.760]   As I was talking with John the Expediter, we were talking about his scenario versus
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:48.100]   and compared to the financial situation of one of his friends and he was sharing how
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:53.800]   his friend was $30,000 in student loan debt and had gotten a degree to work as a dental
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.300]   hygienist.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.420]   But then she had just simply put herself in a situation where she got laid off from the
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.540]   dental hygiene job.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:06.900]   So here she was $30,000 in debt and didn't really like dental – the work of dental
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.460]   hygiene and was – unfortunately, was jobless and trying to figure out what to do.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.880]   She was asking him, "How do I get started working as an expedited trucker?"
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.700]   If you compare the approach of that versus the approach of, "Hey, I'm going to work
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.260]   hard during this period of my life.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.820]   I'm going to live cheap and I'm going to study hard."
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.580]   You can come out of the other side of two or three years on the road with a college
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:37.980]   degree under your belt and $100,000 in the bank instead of coming out of a four or five-year
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.620]   college program or maybe it's a dental hygienist training program, a couple, three years with
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.660]   $30,000 of student loan debt.
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:52.720]   Taking the path of hard work and using the time to study is the better course.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.740]   There is so much information available today.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:08.060]   You could become a world-class investor practically for free through study, listening, reading
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.100]   and application and you hardly need to pay for anything.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.460]   So as you're piling up money, recognize that you've got to learn new skills.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:23.260]   If you act like a bozo and spend all the money as quickly as possible, you'll always be
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.500]   broke.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.260]   But if you recognize the fact that, "Hey, perhaps I'm starting from a disadvantaged
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:34.460]   place and I'm just simply working a simple job, driving a truck," that's a time at
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.180]   which you say, "I've got to learn new skills.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.620]   Let me learn to think like an investor.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.940]   Let me learn to think like a millionaire.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.660]   Let me understand what the millionaires do and how I can copy them."
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.540]   You're going to need to be successful in life.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.140]   You're going to need a diverse array of skills.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.060]   So don't get locked into thinking that it's just one thing.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.380]   Yes, you need to study investing.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.940]   But in John's case, he's interested in photography.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.020]   You need to study photography.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.620]   So listen and learn about photography.
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.420]   Take the courses.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.100]   Maybe you need to study about home building.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.580]   We'll talk about why in a moment.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.660]   Well, start studying.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.220]   Develop a diverse array of skills.
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.460]   Maybe learn a couple of languages.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.980]   You can learn languages entirely by audio.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:17.620]   I've done this for years, listening to educational audio on various languages while I drive around
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.500]   in my car.
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.500]   Easy to do.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.300]   You can learn a new language every year that way with the amount of time that people spend
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.020]   on the road.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.860]   So if you're interested in anthropology and you're going to go and work in the Middle
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:34.900]   East, use your truck driving time to study anthropology, learn about anthropology, read
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.660]   the books on anthropology, and go ahead and, why don't you, learn a couple of languages
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.820]   that will be useful to you while you're working in your area of expertise.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.740]   And then when you're ready, get out of the truck and go into the classroom or go into
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.140]   the field.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.340]   So now let me give you some ideas of what you can do with the money.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:59.620]   I'm going to use, for my example, the idea of having saved $100,000 as your starting
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.020]   fund.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:07.140]   I've become convinced that this is a useful and achievable goal for any motivated, diligent
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.300]   person to work towards, $100,000.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.740]   I've also become convinced that this is a good amount of money to work towards as a
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.900]   starting fund.
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:22.340]   I think that just about everybody should start by accumulating $100,000 before they start
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:28.900]   making big life decisions about what direction they're going to go in.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.600]   Now it's not necessarily required that – there's nothing magical about it.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.580]   You could do it on 50, you could do it on 150, but I think it's a good, achievable
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.580]   goal.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.140]   So using my new friend John the Expediter as an example, he said that it's been many
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:49.140]   weeks that he can make at least $1,000 a week, sometimes more, sometimes less.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.980]   But $1,000 a week for someone who's working hard is probably a reasonable amount of money.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.800]   The reason it's reasonable for entry-level work is because of the lifestyle costs associated
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.800]   with it.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:06.020]   The labor market here where I work – where I live in Florida is just for simple manual
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.020]   labor.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:12.980]   The labor market probably shakes out to about $12 an hour is basically the minimum wage
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.740]   for somebody who's working as a laborer.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.180]   If you're going to go and work in retail or something like that, it will be less.
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.900]   There are certainly plenty of teenagers making $9 an hour working at a fast food joint.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:30.040]   But for somebody who's able to do a full day's work, $12 an hour is pretty much the
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   minimum.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.500]   If you go and you hire some people to work as day laborers, that's about what they're
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.500]   going to work for.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.860]   Well, that comes out – $12 an hour, 50 hours a week comes out to about $600 a week.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:45.220]   When you start adding in the lifestyle considerations of being on the road full time, missing family,
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.100]   missing friends, in order to get people to do that, the employers have to pay higher
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.100]   wages.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:56.060]   There would be no reason for you to go and live on the road if you could stay in your
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.700]   hometown and be home with your family and friends and make the same amount of money.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.060]   So they have to pay more for a lot of these types of work.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.180]   If you're going to go and work on an oil rig, they got to pay you more money to be
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.180]   stuck out at sea.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.900]   If you're going to go and ship out to Iraq for six months, they got to pay you more money
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.820]   to be stuck in the big sandbox.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:19.620]   So consider that that's a reasonable assumption to say you can make a thousand bucks a week.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.620]   Maybe it's a little bit less.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.620]   Maybe it's a little bit more.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:26.380]   But what that means is that in under three years of work, if you keep your living expenses
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:34.740]   light, you could accumulate 75, 50, 75, $100,000 with two or three years of work.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.820]   Anybody in the world can stay focused for two or three years on hard work, especially
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.860]   when you've got a clear goal and a clear idea.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.900]   Anybody can do that for two or three years.
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.420]   So let's say that you can stay focused for three years and you can save a hundred grand.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.640]   What are the things that you can do with it?
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.700]   What can you do with that?
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.100]   Here are some examples.
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:04.780]   Number one, you can move from employee to employer in your field of work.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:11.100]   John the expediter should seriously consider what his boss has done, buying a van, putting
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.340]   it on the road.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:19.000]   His boss gets to sit at home and collect 40% of the revenues in exchange for his capital
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.100]   that he was able to use to buy a van and also his help with the scheduling services.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:30.980]   So as you go from having no capital and hiring at your labor to having – excuse me.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.260]   As you go from having only human capital where you're hiring at your labor to drive on
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:40.860]   the road to having financial capital, you should look closely at your current line of
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:48.260]   work and see, "Is there an opportunity for me to profitably employ this financial capital?"
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.660]   Maybe you employ it in buying your own van, buying your own truck.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.260]   That allows you to capture more of the earnings yourself.
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:00.840]   Or maybe you go ahead and employ it in purchasing your own vehicle and then having somebody
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:06.660]   else drive for you part of the time or all of the time.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.660]   That's the first place that most of us should work.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.100]   Might be hard for you to do this if you are working on an oil rig.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.980]   You may not have a couple hundred million dollars sitting in your back pocket, but maybe
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.260]   it's time for you to buy your own fishing boat.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.820]   And now you can move up to be the captain of your own fishing boat instead of being
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.540]   a crew on someone else's.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.100]   But don't restrict yourself to that.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.860]   It may be that as you've accumulated this capital, you've developed an interest in
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.420]   some other type of business.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.940]   A hundred thousand dollars is certainly enough to buy a franchise fee for many of the very
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.260]   profitable franchises that are available.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.900]   You may go ahead and say, "I'm going to open a Subway restaurant here in this town."
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.580]   A Subway sandwich stop can make quite a bit of money, but you've got to have the franchise
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.580]   fee.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:03.380]   But with your hard work, you've developed that or some version of that.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.340]   Or maybe you're going to open your own thing, open your own store, but you need to buy the
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.100]   inventory and you've got your idea.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:14.700]   A hundred thousand dollars will inventory most types of businesses.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:21.580]   A hundred thousand dollars opens up almost any kind of reasonable business for you to
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.220]   start.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:28.300]   And that means that you can continue your work and start to reap the benefits of being
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.500]   a business owner and an entrepreneur.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:35.940]   And you can do this with those few years of hard work.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.780]   Most people who go out to start a business are flat broke.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.780]   They're borrowing on their credit cards to start it.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.820]   They're scrimping and saving.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.300]   They're trying to support a lifestyle, etc.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.820]   You have the opportunity to come in well capitalized.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:54.740]   Quick sidebar, my recommendation to you is don't start any business until you've worked
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.440]   in it.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.660]   If you want to open a restaurant, make sure you go and first work in a restaurant.
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:09.700]   It's a lot cheaper for you to go and hire yourself out for an hourly wage for three,
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.900]   four, five, six months.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:17.180]   Before you start buying a business, you'll learn a lot more and it'll be a lot cheaper.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.180]   You may decide, "Hey, I don't actually want to own this business after all."
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.620]   But a hundred grand will open up just about any kind of business to you.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:34.840]   A hundred grand is enough to purchase living accommodation that will provide for you essentially
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.700]   for the rest of your life if you like.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.860]   Couple ideas on how to do it.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.100]   I have to start first with unique ideas.
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.980]   For somebody who's been on the road, maybe that mobile lifestyle appeals to you.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:50.020]   A hundred grand will buy you a sailboat and provision it very well and you can use that
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.020]   and sail the world.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:57.380]   One of my favorite thrillers, if you're into thriller novels, Matthew Bracken's book called
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.260]   Enemies Foreign and Domestic is fantastic.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.300]   The whole trilogy is great.
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:05.820]   But the hero of that story is a young man who worked on the oil fields.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.680]   His name was Brad in the story.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.540]   He worked on the oil field, saved up his money, then he bought an old sailboat and then used
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:19.360]   his saved money to purchase the necessary equipment and then used his labor to fix up
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:26.900]   and refit the whole sailboat so he could wind up having a paid for livable ocean going sailboat
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.820]   to live on and have enough money to have it fully outfitted.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:35.860]   Well, he bought his freedom on that sailboat with a few years of work in the oil fields.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.020]   So you could do that with a boat if you're interested in that or an RV if you're interested
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.020]   in that.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.980]   But you could certainly do that also with any kind of normal traditional house.
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:48.500]   There are towns all over this country and all over the world where you could go in and
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:55.820]   pay cash for a nice little house with a hundred grand and have a paid for debt free house
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.740]   to live in.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.740]   What would that buy you?
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:05.380]   Well, it buys you the ability to do just about anything you want because you've taken away
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:10.620]   many of your living expenses, many of your housing expenses at least.
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:18.700]   Buy it right, fill it with some roommates, and now not only does it remove your cost,
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.620]   but it gives you a source of income, revenue.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:27.380]   I've always found it interesting for those who say, "Well, $100,000 isn't enough to buy
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.100]   the kind of house that I'd like to live in."
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.100]   That's true.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:35.240]   But is $100,000 enough for you to build for yourself the type of house you'd like to live
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.240]   in?
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:42.620]   If I were going to go back and do it all over again, I'd love to have some older person
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:48.020]   come along and give me an idea like this and say, "Joshua, why don't you take, say, the
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.460]   first few years, 18 years old, why don't you go and work?
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.660]   But work in a job that'll allow you to learn while you're on the job, learn while you're
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.660]   driving across the road.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:01.780]   And then take that money and come back and start working in some of the trades and apprentice
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:07.220]   in a few of the different trades, work six months in carpentry, work six months in plumbing,
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.220]   et cetera.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.180]   And then use your off time and go ahead and build your own house for yourself.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:15.100]   Got $100,000, learning the skills, applying them.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:21.500]   I saw a news story a couple of, some months ago where a woman had built for herself a
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:25.260]   house and she ostensibly had learned it all on YouTube.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:30.140]   It's incredible the opportunities that are there, but you're going to need some capital.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:35.540]   You create the capital with work and then you may take and apply the labor.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:39.720]   Buy the piece of land, build the house, live in a tent if you need to, keep your expenses
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.820]   down while you're building it.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.860]   But think about where you come out the other side.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.820]   You can do this at relatively any age, but I'm thinking especially of young people like
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.580]   John the Expediter.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:56.700]   You come out at say 25 years old, you've got a nice house, paid off, gives you tremendous
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.740]   flexibility.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.980]   Keep enough capital to start a business, make sure you have sources of income so you
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.140]   don't spend it all on a place to live, but you've got tremendous flexibility.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:11.060]   Another big picture area of focus, remember I started with business, then housing, is
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.420]   education.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:17.220]   You can use the money to purchase for yourself an educational accreditation that can be helpful
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:21.460]   in launching a significant career.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.760]   Maybe that's an area of specialty.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.000]   Maybe that's you go ahead and get your degree from long-distance study while you're saving
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.260]   up money.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:37.260]   Then you sit for your board exams or sit for your MCATs or the LSATs or for something like
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.620]   that, medical school or physical therapy school or law school or business school.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.880]   You go ahead and now you have the money that you can use so that you come out the other
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.000]   side debt-free.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.960]   Much more powerful place to start than being $100,000 in debt.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.720]   Use those years of hard work to home in on what you're interested in.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:00.080]   Get some experience in the field to make sure you're sure about it.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.240]   And then go ahead and buy yourself the educational accreditation you need to open a market that
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:09.920]   moves you from earning $50,000 a year to earning $500,000 a year.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.600]   I'd much rather see someone do that than come out the other side with a six-figure student
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.920]   loan bill.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:22.480]   Much more respect, and I'm convinced the lifestyle is much better for the person who's worked
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.640]   their way through.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:29.600]   And these are ideas on how you can do it and how you can use this type of work that, again,
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   has simple entry requirements to open up an entirely different world of educational opportunities
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.480]   for you.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.200]   In some ways, I did a certain version of this myself.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:49.240]   When I was in college, I worked my way through my freshman year of college with scholarships
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.600]   and earned income and didn't borrow money my freshman year of college.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.320]   Then in my sophomore year of college, I got lazy and I started borrowing money on credit
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.580]   cards to pay for my living expenses and student loans to pay for my school expenses.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.800]   That continued on my sophomore and my junior year.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:07.520]   In my junior year, I said, "This is crazy," and I decided to get out of debt.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.680]   I worked like crazy to get out of debt my senior year of school.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.680]   I was able to graduate.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.560]   I checked with Sally May two weeks before I graduated and I was able to graduate debt-free
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.160]   from college.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.600]   On my resume, when I was applying for jobs and talking to people, I put at the bottom
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:28.720]   "graduated debt-free," I phrased it appropriately, but something like, "Paid for my own school
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.560]   and graduated debt-free."
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.840]   People would skip over the rest of my resume and they would home in on that and they would
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.360]   ask me the story.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:44.700]   I had various people that I interviewed with really appreciate that and it opened a lot
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.280]   of doors for me.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:53.440]   If you followed a path like I've laid out here, it would open a lot of doors for you.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.800]   Number four, investments.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:01.860]   Obviously, when we've developed this amount of money and savings, we need to think carefully
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.720]   about how to invest it wisely.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   $100,000 can open the world of wealth if well invested.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:19.720]   $100,000 of starting capital is enough to capitalize a real estate empire.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:27.280]   $100,000 is enough wealth to capitalize a profitable trading business.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:34.600]   $100,000 of wealth is enough to capitalize private investments and private businesses.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:42.800]   $100,000 is more money than almost anybody puts their hands on.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:51.160]   Depending on which data source we use, about half of US Americans can't come up with $1,000
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.720]   cash.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:58.560]   About half of Americans can't come up with $1,000 cash.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:07.640]   By saving anything more than $1,000, you move yourself from the bottom 50% to the top 50%.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.400]   Here's one that's even more sobering.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:17.600]   About 75% of Americans who reach retirement age, what we usually consider to be retirement
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:25.720]   age, have less than $100,000 saved.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:31.080]   That's why I don't take people who talk about retirement seriously in this way, meaning
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.660]   that most people will not retire because they just don't have the money saved.
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.000]   If people do have the money saved, they don't have it liquid.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.400]   Usually it's tied up in home equity.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:47.800]   If you can accumulate for yourself $100,000, you move yourself into essentially the top
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.840]   quartile.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.320]   Not only the top quartile of all Americans, but even the top quartile of retiring age
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.000]   Americans.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.480]   Think about the impact on your life.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.800]   Yet, is there anything complicated about this plan that I've laid out?
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:09.160]   Is there anything that requires some kind of special skill?
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:18.040]   John the Expediter seemed like a very nice man, but the basic skill is to go and get
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:24.360]   a job in this type of field, to get rid of his stuff that's costing him money at home
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:30.640]   to lower expenses, and the ability to keep your bottom planted in a seat and keep the
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.740]   van headed between the little white lines.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:41.320]   Those aren't very unique skills.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.740]   You don't need to be a special fancy person, but you do need to consider it and you do
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.320]   need to have the idea and you do need to work about it.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.240]   If you're struggling to get ahead and you're struggling with trying to figure out what
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:59.600]   to do, consider just the example of John the Expediter and consider these simple examples
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.760]   I've used to see how they can apply to your situation.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.320]   You'll need to calculate for yourself your own path.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.720]   I would not do what I've described in this show at this point in time.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.120]   The cost would be too high.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   I'm married.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.560]   I have children.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:21.080]   I would never take the chance of losing my family to go and sit behind a wheel.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.040]   But that may not be you.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:29.040]   You may be in a situation where you don't have those responsibilities.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:35.560]   You could take two or three years of work and apply this type of mindset and put yourself
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:41.240]   well on a pathway to financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.240]   That's all I want to share with you today.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.520]   I hope this has been useful to you as a practical, real example.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.200]   John, as I promised, I told you I'd do the show for you.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.000]   Thanks for sharing your story and sharing just some of the stories of the business with
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   you.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.240]   By the way, John and other listeners who are in driving businesses, you need to think carefully
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.320]   about the future of your market.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:04.360]   If I were in a driving occupation as a job, working as a taxi driver, working as an Uber
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:09.240]   driver, working as a truck driver, working as an expediter, anything that involves just
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:14.480]   driving, I would not be planning on a long-term career in that.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   The writing is on the wall.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.840]   Most of those jobs, I don't know if it would be a decade, who knows, a decade and a half,
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.140]   but I would not be making plans beyond a decade for my job to still exist.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:30.880]   So you need to be using this time to retool, use this time to earn, and transition to something
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.880]   else.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.880]   There are always opportunities available.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.400]   Hope you've enjoyed today's show.
