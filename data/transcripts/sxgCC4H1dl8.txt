[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.060]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.960]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.120]   Today, we're discussing stimulants,
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.480]   in particular stimulants for the treatment of ADHD,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.640]   or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.960]   As many of you know, there's tremendous interest
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.640]   in drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.600]   and other stimulants,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.080]   as well as non-stimulant prescription drugs
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.100]   that have been shown to improve the symptoms of ADHD,
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.240]   such as modafinil, armodafinil, and guanfacine.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.560]   Today, I'm going to discuss all of these compounds
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.700]   in the context of how they work
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.000]   to improve the symptoms of ADHD.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.840]   I'm going to address common questions about these compounds,
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.100]   such as, are they just speed?
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.920]   Are they similar to meth or methamphetamine?
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.280]   I'll talk about their addictive potential,
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.380]   as well as their potential to cause psychotic symptoms,
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.320]   both in the short and long-term.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.520]   And of course, I will talk about the scientific literature
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.120]   surrounding the most frequently asked question
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.380]   about these compounds,
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.980]   which is, what are the long-term consequences
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.520]   of taking any of them in childhood or in adulthood?
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.760]   Now, today's discussion centers
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.640]   around the use of these compounds,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.620]   both for childhood and for adult ADHD.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.160]   But of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.880]   that there are a tremendous number of people
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.440]   that use these prescription drugs without a prescription
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.880]   in order to improve their ability to focus
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.500]   and indeed also use them recreationally.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.080]   In fact, some surveys reveal that as high as 80%
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.020]   of college-age young adults have used one or several
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.400]   of prescription drugs, such as Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.560]   or similar, at some point,
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.440]   and are doing so without a prescription.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.400]   So they are either obtaining those drugs
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.020]   from those that do have prescriptions for them, for ADHD,
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.520]   or they are obtaining them through black market sources,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.140]   which of course carries an additional and very serious risk
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.280]   related to the so-called fentanyl crisis
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.680]   that is as high as 75% of black market drugs nowadays
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.680]   of various kinds, but certainly including the sorts of drugs
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.080]   we're going to talk about today
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.840]   are contaminated with fentanyl
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.280]   and therefore are very deadly.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.760]   So today I'm going to describe
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.840]   what these various drugs really are,
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.720]   how they work at the level of neurons and brain networks,
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.140]   and how they change those brain networks
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.300]   in ways that really can allow people with ADHD
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.120]   to be able to focus better.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.820]   I will answer the common question,
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.880]   which is why is it that giving children speed,
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.180]   because indeed several, not all,
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.640]   but several of the compounds I'm going to discuss are speed.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.640]   They are amphetamine.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.780]   Why would that cause a reduction in hyperactivity
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.980]   if speed is a stimulant?
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.100]   So I'll answer that question for you.
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.820]   And I will also answer questions that are commonly asked,
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.420]   such as how these drugs impact things like sleep,
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.040]   hormone health, reproductive health,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.060]   as well as what is their impact on height.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.600]   Indeed, it was one prominent hypothesis
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.820]   that these ADHD meds could actually restrict
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.700]   the height of children.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.480]   I'll tell you whether or not that's actually true or not.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.900]   And I'll discuss the data surrounding
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.180]   whether or not these drugs predispose people
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.940]   to becoming addicts to other substances,
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.300]   even if people cease or continue taking the stimulants
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.460]   that can help them in the clinical sense for ADHD.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.860]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.460]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.500]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.980]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.580]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.660]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.280]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.740]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.140]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.780]   red meat available.
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.980]   Maui Nui spent nearly a decade building
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.820]   a USDA-certified wild harvesting system
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.780]   to help balance deer populations on the island of Maui.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.700]   The solution they built turns the proliferation
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.100]   of an invasive species
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.560]   into a wide range of nutrient-dense products,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.420]   from fresh butcher cuts and organ meats
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.840]   to bone broth and jerky.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.900]   I'm a particular fan of their bone broth,
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.140]   which has an unmatched 25 grams of protein
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.080]   per 100 calories.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.540]   And I also love the ground venison and the venison steaks.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.360]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.140]   with expert guests in nutrition who make it clear
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.020]   that we should all be getting at least one gram of protein
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.240]   per pound of body weight each day.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.780]   With Maui Nui Venison products,
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.980]   that's extremely easy to do,
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.540]   and they're extremely delicious as well.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.180]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.280]   go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.100]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.180]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.500]   to get 20% off.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.060]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.160]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.940]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.780]   and the visual system,
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.900]   and I can tell you that your visual system
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.420]   has to contend with an enormous number
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.540]   of different challenges
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.660]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.400]   Roca understands all of those challenges
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.440]   at the level of the eye
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.220]   and the visual system within the brain,
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.320]   and they've designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.260]   so that no matter what environment you're in,
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.320]   you can always see with crystal clarity.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.700]   Originally, their glasses were designed for sports,
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.580]   and as a consequence,
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.160]   all of their glasses are extremely lightweight.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.140]   And as well, they won't slip off your face
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.820]   even if you get sweaty.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.920]   However, despite being designed initially for performance,
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.460]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.140]   include a lot of different styles
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.140]   that are designed for you to wear to work or out to dinner,
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.260]   as well as what I call the cyborg style
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.200]   that are designed for cycling, et cetera.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.740]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.120]   go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.320]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.420]   to save 20% off your first order.
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.820]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.260]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.900]   Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.740]   that increases blood ketones.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.300]   And most people have heard of the so-called ketogenic diet,
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.580]   but most people, including myself,
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.020]   are not on the ketogenic diet.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.320]   That is, I and most people eat complex carbohydrates,
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.420]   fruits, and things of that sort,
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.540]   in addition to quality proteins, et cetera.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.060]   It turns out that even if you're not following
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.000]   a ketogenic diet,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.860]   increasing your blood ketones can still have benefits.
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.900]   So for instance, I use Ketone IQ
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.500]   anytime I want to do extended bouts of focused work,
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.180]   preparing for podcasts, research, writing grants.
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.320]   And if I ever want to exercise,
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.060]   but I don't have time to eat,
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.180]   or I don't want to have my gut full of food,
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.460]   taking Ketone IQ and thereby increasing my blood ketones
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.860]   allows me to do cognitive work or physical workouts
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.900]   without getting hungry
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.680]   and with plenty of energy and cognitive focus.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.280]   If you'd like to try Ketone IQ,
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.740]   you can go to hvmn.com/huberman to save 20% off.
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.900]   Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.560]   I'm pleased to announce that I will be hosting
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.020]   two live events in September of 2023.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.540]   The first live event will take place
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.680]   in Toronto on September 12th.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.140]   The second live event will take place
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.740]   in Chicago on September 28th.
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.780]   Both live events will include a lecture
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.160]   and a question and answer period
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.460]   and are entitled "The Brain-Body Contract,"
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.820]   during which I will discuss tools and science
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.520]   related to mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.000]   And I should mention that a lot of that content
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.700]   will have absolutely no overlap
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.060]   with content covered previously
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.260]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast or elsewhere.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.420]   If you're interested in attending
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.940]   either or both of these events,
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.900]   please go to hubermanlab.com/tour
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.080]   and enter the code Huberman to get early access to tickets.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.980]   Once again, that's hubermanlab.com/tour
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.540]   and use the code Huberman to access tickets.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.980]   I hope to see you there.
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.080]   Let's talk about treatments for ADHD
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.740]   and why stimulant treatments in particular
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.220]   can be so effective.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.020]   First of all, it's long been known
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.620]   that there are specific brain networks
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.980]   involved in what we call attention.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.340]   Now, attention is not one thing, actually.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.140]   It involves several different cognitive operations,
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.420]   including the suppression of noise,
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.260]   that is turning down the background chatter in our heads
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.620]   and turning down our attending to things outside us
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.240]   like noises or visual cues
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.820]   that are not relevant to what we want to do.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.820]   And it also involves ramping up or attending or focusing
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.560]   on particular things that are happening
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.620]   either in our immediate environment or in our head or both.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.020]   So if that all sounds rather complex, indeed it is.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.820]   It involves several different networks
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.620]   operating in parallel.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.140]   But what we know for sure,
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.980]   based on a lot of clinical and scientific laboratory data,
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.740]   is that the so-called prefrontal cortex,
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.220]   the region of neural real estate in your brain
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.940]   just behind your forehead,
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.380]   is critically important for orchestrating
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.320]   which neural circuits are going to be more or less active
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.620]   at a given moment
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.060]   in order to bring about what we call focus or attention
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.120]   or task switching or our ability indeed to multitask
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.500]   because we can actually multitask to some extent.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.800]   In fact, if you were to look at somebody
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.180]   and focus on perhaps the expression on their face,
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.620]   you could do that while also attending to a conversation
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.960]   that's happening nearby.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.320]   It's energetically demanding, it's hard to do,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.520]   but we can do that.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.460]   That's actually referred to as covert attention.
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.660]   You're covertly paying attention to something else.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.240]   And then you can switch that attention
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.880]   back to just one thing or one small collection of things.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.780]   The point being that attention is a powerful resource.
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.260]   It's what allows us to navigate through life
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.460]   with efficiency and to be adaptive in our behaviors.
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.040]   It's what allows us to learn and to build relationships
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.280]   and have successful school careers
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.060]   and professional careers and so on.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.560]   But it is indeed expensive.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.980]   It takes metabolic resources, just at rest.
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.960]   If you were to think about essentially nothing or whatever
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.620]   just pops into your mind with no dedicated effort
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.600]   toward paying attention to anything,
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.220]   your brain would consume about 25%
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.340]   of your daily caloric needs.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.760]   And then when you lump on top of that,
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.280]   your need or your attempts to focus on things,
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.360]   to pay attention to specific things,
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.920]   it should come as no surprise
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.020]   as to why that often can make us feel tired
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.640]   as if we've been working really hard
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.680]   and we've been running a quote unquote mental marathon
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.400]   when trying to learn and attend to things.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.080]   It's hard work for the brain and yet we can pay attention
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.680]   because of that very precious real estate
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.580]   just behind our foreheads, the prefrontal cortex.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.580]   Now in people, both children and adults that have ADHD,
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.200]   their prefrontal cortex is not necessarily deficient
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.360]   in any specific way, except that it is not as good
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.440]   at orchestrating the activity of other brain networks
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.480]   operating in parallel with it.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.440]   What do I mean by that?
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.920]   Well, if we take a step back and say,
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.320]   what is the prefrontal cortex really doing?
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.120]   The prefrontal cortex has this amazing ability
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.920]   through what's called top-down inhibition
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.720]   to quiet other brain areas.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.200]   So for instance, if you are feeling agitated
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.480]   but you need to sit still, your ability to sit still,
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.280]   even if it takes a bit of work,
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.560]   is coordinated by your prefrontal cortex
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.000]   sending inhibitory suppressive electrical signals
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.180]   to the networks of your brain
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.820]   that are trying to generate physical action.
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.320]   In addition to that, if you are in a conversation,
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.080]   that's either a difficult one or a boring one,
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.800]   or you are tempted to interrupt
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.520]   and you are actively holding back your desire to walk away
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.140]   or to yawn or to blurt something out,
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.500]   it's your prefrontal cortex
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.140]   that is controlling that active suppression.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.620]   So in many ways, you can just think of the prefrontal cortex
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.900]   as an orchestra conductor that is essentially saying,
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.900]   shh, or not right now, be quiet, this is not the time,
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.700]   to many different brain networks all at once.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.260]   Now, in addition to that,
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.760]   your prefrontal cortex is coordinating
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.440]   with other brain networks
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.480]   that are involved in generating what's called salience
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.720]   or attention to particular signals.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.440]   So the prefrontal cortex in many ways
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.280]   is like a teacher or an orchestra conductor.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.680]   It can point to, in the neurochemical sense, that is,
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.720]   point to a given brain structure and say,
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.560]   you, I'd like to hear more from you right now.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.300]   Yes, you, the student in the back, speak up.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.600]   And a moment later, point to a collection of small students
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.680]   chattering in the back,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.960]   again, I'm presenting all this by analogy,
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.080]   and say, hey, hey, hey, you guys, quiet down right now.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.340]   So-and-so is going to come up to the front of the room
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.200]   and help us work through this particular math problem.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.960]   So when we hear that the prefrontal cortex
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.900]   exerts what's called executive function,
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.840]   what that refers to is the prefrontal cortex's ability
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.420]   to quiet the activity of particular neural circuits
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.300]   and to enhance or increase the salience
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.520]   of other neural circuits that are involved
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.800]   in creating our spotlight of attention.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.160]   And what we know for sure,
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.480]   based on many, many brain imaging studies,
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.200]   is that ADHD is not necessarily a deficit
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.520]   in prefrontal cortical function,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.160]   but rather the prefrontal cortex's ability
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.600]   to communicate with other brain areas in the proper ways.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.680]   And so what results in the brain of a person,
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.840]   either young or old with ADHD,
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.360]   is that a lot of the background chatter
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.680]   becomes very, very loud.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.720]   So for instance, we have a brain network
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.180]   called the default mode network.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.780]   This is a fascinating brain network.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.840]   This is the brain network that is active
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.620]   when you just sort of sit in place
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.720]   and don't think about much,
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.260]   and then you start having ideas
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.300]   about what you might do next week.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.080]   It tends to be very autobiographical,
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.820]   so you might remember an experience from the past.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.640]   You might think about some of your desires,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.440]   some of your dislikes.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.800]   This default mode network, as it's called,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.720]   is also involved in our imagination,
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.400]   in our spooling together of different experiences
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.800]   that we've had.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.000]   It doesn't tend to be the thing
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.760]   that's really focused on anything external in particular
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.420]   all at once.
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.520]   The default mode network is always active,
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.260]   but it's when we start to attend to something,
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.920]   especially things external to us,
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.700]   like something written on a page or a conversation
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.440]   or something that we really need to learn,
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.520]   something we need to pay attention to,
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.040]   that the activity of the default mode network
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.720]   is suppressed somewhat,
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.520]   and that suppression occurs not just by accident,
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.760]   but because the prefrontal cortex
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.040]   is actively suppressing it.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.900]   In kids and adults with ADHD,
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.000]   the default mode network is often still active
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.240]   at a very robust level,
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.120]   even while we're trying to attend to things,
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.500]   and that's why someone with ADHD will sit down
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.300]   and try and do some focused work,
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.200]   and they'll start thinking about something they want
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.800]   or something they dislike.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.400]   Their internal state will start to distract them,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.840]   and of course, there are other networks in the brain.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.200]   There's actually what's called a true salience network.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.640]   There's the dorsal attention network.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.040]   There are a bunch of different networks and brain areas,
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.840]   but again, when thinking about ADHD,
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.400]   and especially when thinking about how the drugs
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.680]   that we're going to talk about today
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.860]   work to alleviate the symptoms of ADHD,
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.560]   and in thinking about why so many people use
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.360]   or even abuse these drugs for sake of learning
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.060]   or recreationally, we might say,
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.720]   you start to realize that everything centers back
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.080]   to the prefrontal cortex and the prefrontal cortex's ability
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.160]   to actively suppress and actively enhance the activity
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.960]   of these multiple brain networks,
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.400]   including default mode network, salience network,
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.040]   dorsal attention network, et cetera.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.480]   So rather than overwhelm you with a bunch of names
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.360]   of brain areas and brain networks,
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.400]   today I'd really like our discussion to focus on first
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.320]   what the various drugs that are used to treat ADHD are,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.240]   that is, how do they work at the level of neurons?
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.220]   Second, how they create a certain set of conditions
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.660]   that allow the prefrontal cortex to be a better conductor.
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.520]   Third, how that can be leveraged during development
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.920]   to actually teach the prefrontal cortex of a young child
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.780]   to learn to be a better conductor,
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.580]   because that's really the hallmark of the use of these drugs
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.620]   is to try and enhance the activity of particular circuits
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.560]   to create a sort of learning so that the prefrontal cortex
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.040]   is much more efficient at doing its job of conducting.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.200]   And then fourth, we're going to talk about
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.080]   the various things that I think most people out there
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.920]   ask about when they hear about drugs
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.440]   like Adderall, Vyvanse, and Ritalin, et cetera,
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.760]   which is, you know, are they addictive?
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.100]   Why are they addictive?
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.460]   Can one use them briefly or even from time to time
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.640]   and still be okay?
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.080]   What if I use them as a child
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.440]   and I don't want to be on them anymore?
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.780]   Should I put my child on these drugs, et cetera?
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.840]   It is, I believe, only by understanding the biology
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.780]   of how these drugs work
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.820]   and their potential both to improve brain function,
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.780]   but also some of the dangers associated with these drugs
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.660]   that one can really answer those questions for themselves
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.820]   or for their children.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.100]   Okay, so let's start with a very basic but critical question,
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.100]   which is why in the world would amphetamines, speed,
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.060]   or other stimulants improve the symptoms of ADHD?
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.280]   That's so critical to answer because if you think about it,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.100]   the prefrontal cortex needs to coordinate the actions
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.820]   of these other circuits.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.320]   And so just increasing the amount of activity
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.020]   in prefrontal cortex, you can imagine,
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.860]   would create a state of hyper-focus perhaps,
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.100]   but actually that's not the case.
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.440]   If you just were to ramp up the activity
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.840]   of prefrontal cortex, what you would find
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.820]   is that somebody would become even less efficient
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.860]   at paying attention to what they wanted to.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.220]   Rather, they would pay attention to whatever was presented
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.720]   in front of them with laser focus.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.000]   They would lock on to essentially anything.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.120]   And that's not good.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.980]   One of the key things about prefrontal cortex
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.000]   is that it needs to be flexible.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.100]   It needs to be able to pay attention to this.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.000]   Then it needs to be able to pay attention to that.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.680]   Then it needs to go back to paying attention
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.060]   to the thing it was paying attention to previously
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.620]   and so on and so forth.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.740]   Life, that is an effective, adaptive life, a good life,
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.980]   consists of self-directing one's attention
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.820]   most all of the time.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.780]   So why would stimulants do that?
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.860]   Well, almost all, not all,
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.060]   but almost all of the drugs used to treat ADHD
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.180]   fall under the category of stimulants
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.740]   or what are called sympathomimetics.
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.140]   Sympathomimetic refers to the fact
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.220]   that we naturally have a component of our nervous system
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.480]   called the autonomic nervous system.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.500]   The autonomic nervous system has two major components.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.660]   One is called the sympathetic arm
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.220]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.420]   Has nothing to do with sympathy,
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.440]   has everything to do with ramping up
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.060]   our level of attention and arousal.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.540]   It is the so-called fight or flight
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.940]   aspect of our nervous system,
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.220]   or rather it mediates fight or flight,
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.540]   but it mediates a bunch of other things too,
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.500]   including sexual arousal, including excitement and focus
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.480]   about something that we want to learn
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.020]   or somebody that we want to learn more about
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.920]   or remembering a phone number
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.140]   or anything that puts us into a state of alertness and focus.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.380]   The other arm of the autonomic nervous system
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.400]   is the so-called parasympathetic arm
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.560]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.500]   And that's often referred to as the so-called
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.740]   rest and digest component of our nervous system.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.580]   And yes, it controls rest.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.340]   Indeed, it puts us into sleep.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.520]   And yes, it's involved in digestion,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.320]   but it's involved in a bunch of other things as well,
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.860]   including sexual arousal, including rates of digestion,
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.040]   including salivation, including all sorts of things
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.100]   that don't just have to do with resting and digesting.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.700]   The way to think about the autonomic nervous system
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.080]   is it's a sort of seesaw.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.860]   So it's always at a balance someplace
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.080]   between either predominantly sympathetic
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.100]   or predominantly parasympathetic,
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.860]   but both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic arms
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.040]   of the autonomic nervous system
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.340]   are always active all the time.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.060]   It's not as if one is completely active
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.900]   and the other is shut off.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.940]   Even in sleep, your sympathetic nervous system
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.060]   is not completely turned off.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.100]   And even during a panic attack,
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.620]   your parasympathetic nervous system is not completely
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.460]   turned off.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.520]   Drugs to treat ADHD,
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.900]   which fall under the category of stimulants,
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.900]   are sympathomimetics because they trigger the release
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.340]   of neurochemicals and the activation of components
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.860]   of our nervous system that very much resemble
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.740]   the activation of the so-called sympathetic nervous system,
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.560]   the one that makes us more alert and more aroused.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.580]   So that's why they're called sympathomimetics.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.620]   And the word stimulant refers to a general category
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.460]   of drugs that are sympathomimetics.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.300]   Now, the most commonly discussed sympathomimetic
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.060]   is one that fortunately is not prescribed for ADHD,
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.540]   and that's methamphetamine.
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.980]   These days, we hear a lot about meth.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.840]   Meth, which is methylated amphetamine,
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.280]   is an extremely potent sympathomimetic,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.020]   and it has tremendous abuse potential.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.640]   Believe it or not, meth or methamphetamine
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.640]   is actually available as a prescription drug,
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.700]   but it is used very rarely because of its high abuse
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.520]   potential and all the terrible things that it can do
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.260]   in terms of cardiovascular health,
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.240]   in terms of oral health, right?
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.280]   There's this stereotype that meth users
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.860]   have very degraded teeth, and indeed they do.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.100]   There's a reason for that related
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.260]   to how meth impacts the brain and body.
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.060]   I'm going to talk a little bit about methamphetamine
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.260]   a little bit later,
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.260]   but let's just place methamphetamine high on the shelf
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:08.260]   as the most potent sympathomimetic that's out there,
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.980]   because even though it's not often prescribed for ADHD,
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.760]   there are a class of compounds very similar to it
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.740]   that have a very similar pattern of action
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.540]   that is not quite as potent,
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.440]   but that leverages the same underlying mechanisms,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.700]   and they are very commonly prescribed for ADHD,
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.460]   namely Adderall and Vyvanse.
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.980]   So first let's talk about Adderall and what Adderall is.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.520]   Adderall is a combination
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.140]   of what are called amphetamine salts.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.940]   Amphetamine salts refers to the fact
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.600]   that there are two major forms of amphetamine.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.820]   There's a D amphetamine or dexer amphetamine
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.220]   and levoenfetamine or L amphetamine.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.340]   So I'll refer to these as D and L amphetamine.
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.580]   And for you chemistry-minded folks out there,
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.200]   the D and the L also refer to the fact
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.880]   that there is a L left-handed version of the molecule,
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.500]   and there's a D or right-handed version of the molecule.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.460]   This is only important to understand
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.720]   insofar as you know that the D and the L forms
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.760]   of the molecule look very similar,
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.200]   but they're mirror images of one another,
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.780]   and yet they can have very different actions
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.160]   in the brain and body.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.240]   So Adderall is a three to one ratio
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.780]   of D amphetamine to L amphetamine.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.100]   You should know that L amphetamine tends to be less potent
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.400]   in increasing certain neurochemicals in the brain,
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.660]   I'll talk about which neurochemicals they are in a moment,
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.920]   than is D amphetamine.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.780]   So D amphetamine is potent stuff,
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.420]   not as potent as methamphetamine, but very potent stuff.
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.260]   L amphetamine, a little bit less potent.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.120]   L amphetamine tends to be the amphetamine
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.660]   that increases blood pressure and heart rate,
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.220]   what we call peripheral effects,
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.560]   because it happens in the periphery,
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.800]   outside the central nervous system.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.200]   Peripheral effects like increased heart rate,
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.540]   increased blood pressure, sweating, et cetera,
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.000]   are mostly activated by L amphetamine,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.880]   whereas D amphetamine tends to work mainly
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.080]   on receptors in the brain,
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.520]   and therefore have effects mainly restricted to the brain.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.020]   Now, what are these effects that I've been referring to?
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.320]   The major effect of Adderall
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.000]   and other sympathomimetic stimulants
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.940]   is to increase the activity of two neurochemicals.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.640]   The first of those neurochemicals is dopamine,
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.980]   and the other of those neurochemicals is norepinephrine.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.280]   First off, I want to be clear that when I say norepinephrine,
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.660]   I could just as easily say noradrenaline,
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.680]   because those are the exact same thing.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.240]   And forgive me, even though I wasn't the one
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.220]   to name the same thing, two different things,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.600]   I'll try and stay with norepinephrine,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.160]   but I may say noradrenaline, they are the same thing.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.760]   There's a whole story as to how they got named,
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.060]   two different things, but it's the same thing.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.640]   The major effect of Adderall
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.080]   and other sympathomimetic stimulants
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.200]   is to increase the transmission
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.980]   of dopamine and norepinephrine.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.380]   So what is dopamine and what is norepinephrine?
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.120]   Well, both dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.960]   are what are called neuromodulators.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.600]   That is, they have the ability to increase or decrease
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.720]   the firing patterns, the electrical activity
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.500]   of particular brain circuits.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.680]   Both dopamine and norepinephrine have separate roles
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.020]   in creating certain states within our brain and body,
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.120]   but they like to collaborate,
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.780]   meaning they tend to be released at similar locations
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.300]   in the brain in order to deliver us
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.320]   to a particular state of mind and or body.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.060]   So if we were to take a look at just dopamine,
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.320]   we would find that dopamine is released
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.160]   at sites within the brain
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.120]   and increases the activity of brain networks
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.200]   that for the most part lead to increases
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.340]   in motivation, pursuit, and to some extent, mood.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.040]   If we were to look at norepinephrine
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.680]   and where it's released in the brain,
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.940]   it tends to be released at many, not all,
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.120]   but many of the same sites where dopamine is released.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.960]   And the main function of norepinephrine
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.780]   is to increase the activity of neural networks
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.540]   that are involved in attention and focus
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.040]   to particular things in our environment.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.700]   Okay, so think of dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.680]   as collaborators because indeed they are.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.160]   And actually they're very neurochemically similar as well.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.520]   It actually just takes one chemical conversion
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.820]   to turn dopamine into norepinephrine.
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.040]   So they are very similar.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   They're like close cousins that work together
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.160]   to help us achieve a common goal
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.560]   that involves increased motivation, focus, and alertness.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.440]   So when we talk about attention in ADHD,
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.000]   or we talk about quieting the hyperactivity
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.160]   or impulsivity of ADHD,
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.560]   one of the reasons why drugs that are effective
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.900]   in treating ADHD are so effective
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.760]   is because they increase motivation, focus, and alertness,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   and they tend to do that
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.980]   at very focal locations in the brain.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.220]   It's worth taking a couple of minutes
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.000]   to think about how sympathomimetics, such as Adderall,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.920]   actually increase dopamine and norepinephrine.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.820]   They do so by affecting a couple of specific operations
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.000]   at the so-called synapse.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.840]   What are synapses?
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.400]   Synapses are the communication points between neurons.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.000]   They're actually the spaces between neurons,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.540]   but that's where a lot of the action is
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.080]   when neurons, as we say, are stimulating the next neuron
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.040]   or activating the next neuron or inhibiting the next neuron.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.920]   The word neuron just simply refers to nerve cell.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.000]   And so what nerve cells have is they have a cell body
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.580]   that contains their DNA and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.280]   They have a long wire-like process,
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.000]   which is referred to as an axon.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.660]   And at the end of that axon,
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.000]   there are a bunch of proteins in there
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.120]   that do really interesting things.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.640]   So for instance, there are proteins
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.080]   down at the end of the axon
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.840]   that package neurotransmitter into little spherical things
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.520]   that we call vesicles.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.040]   Those vesicles can fuse with the end of the axon
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.640]   and vomit the contents, those neurotransmitters,
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.920]   into the synaptic cleft,
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.160]   into that little space between neurons.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.360]   And then if enough of those neurotransmitters
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.040]   bind to receptors on what's called the postsynaptic side,
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.620]   which just simply means the neuron on the other side,
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.640]   well, then the next neuron will become active.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.840]   And then the signal will propagate
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.740]   from one neuron to the next.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.960]   Now, I just described that whole process pretty quickly.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.080]   And I like to think pretty simply,
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.720]   but it actually involves a lot of different protein bits
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.480]   and some pretty complex machinery
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.880]   in order to make that happen.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.800]   I don't want to overcomplicate our conversation,
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   but what I will tell you is that down in the synapse,
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.040]   in the presynaptic terminal,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.860]   the neuron that is going to release neurotransmitter,
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.420]   there are what are called transporters,
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:45.020]   which sit there and suck up or suck back up
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.520]   some of the neurotransmitter that's been released.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.020]   There are dopamine transporters
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.740]   and there are norepinephrine
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.800]   or noradrenergic transporters down in the synapse.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:00.580]   What Adderall does and what other sympathomimetics do
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.580]   is to inhibit or disrupt the action of those transporters.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.180]   And the net consequence of that
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.700]   is that when dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.220]   are released into the synapse,
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.780]   more of it is allowed to stick around
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.280]   and to bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.500]   than would be the case if Adderall or the other stimulant
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.260]   were not present in the system.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.400]   So one way that Adderall increases dopamine
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.260]   and norepinephrine is by disrupting the activity
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.460]   of these presynaptic transporters
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.820]   for dopamine and norepinephrine.
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.900]   The other way that Adderall increases
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.900]   dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.020]   is that it disrupts the activity
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.780]   of a different piece of machinery in the presynaptic neuron,
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.320]   which is called a VMAT,
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.380]   the vesicle monoamine transporter two,
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.020]   if you really want to get specific.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.240]   You don't have to remember these names,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.340]   but what these VMATs do is actually really cool.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.600]   What they do is they actually take whatever transmitter
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.500]   has been brought back up into the cell by transporters
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.040]   and they package it into those vesicles
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.220]   that are then going to be released.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.660]   By disrupting the transporters that vacuum back up
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.980]   some of the dopamine or norepinephrine that's been released,
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.260]   and by also disrupting the packaging
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.360]   of dopamine and norepinephrine into vesicles themselves,
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.740]   what ends up happening is that there's a buildup
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.900]   of a lot more dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.560]   in the presynaptic terminal,
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.820]   so that when an electrical signal travels down the neuron,
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.460]   now the total amount of dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.940]   that's released is increased, okay?
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.340]   So what's happening when you take Adderall
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.580]   is that you're getting more out of the dopamine
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.300]   and norepinephrine that you're releasing,
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.100]   and you're releasing more dopamine
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.700]   and norepinephrine altogether.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.860]   And there's a third mechanism
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.140]   by which Adderall increases the amount of dopamine
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.740]   and norepinephrine present in synapses,
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.380]   and therefore can act on other neurons.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.780]   And that has to do with disruption of the entire network
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.180]   between these different proteins.
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.800]   I'm not going to go into that in any detail
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.140]   because it gets somewhat complicated
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.140]   in terms of the cell biology and some of the biochemistry
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.940]   down at the tips of these axons,
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.700]   but suffice to say that Adderall
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.820]   is such an effective sympathomimetic,
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:20.180]   that is, it can increase dopamine to such a great extent,
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.840]   especially compared to other treatments for ADHD,
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.140]   because of its ability to increase dopamine release
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.860]   and transmission, and therefore action,
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.140]   as well as noradrenergic release and transmission and action
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.700]   down there in the synapse.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:36.980]   And it's worth pointing out
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.800]   that most of the effect of Adderall
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.980]   is in increasing dopamine as opposed to norepinephrine.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.740]   It does increase norepinephrine, but its major effects,
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.260]   or we should say the major effects
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.940]   that have made it such an attractive drug to so many people,
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.540]   both for the treatment of ADHD
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.480]   and for people to take recreationally or off prescription
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.980]   or for sake of studying or work
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.620]   simply because they want to focus more and longer,
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.260]   is because of its ability to increase dopamine
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.920]   to such a great extent.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.460]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.360]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.820]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.180]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.060]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.760]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.980]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.580]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.660]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.640]   once or usually twice a day
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.240]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.340]   Our gut is very important.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.900]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.660]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.060]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.700]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.540]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:49.380]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.560]   In addition, Athletic Greens
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.860]   contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.460]   that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.180]   are met and it tastes great.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.640]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.040]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.020]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.320]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.920]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.320]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.000]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.380]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.280]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.860]   Now, a bit earlier, I mentioned that L-amphetamine,
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.320]   levoanphetamine, is present in Adderall,
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.520]   but at 1/4 the amount of D-amphetamine.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.180]   Okay, so there's a little bit of L-amphetamine
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.540]   and a lot of D-amphetamine in Adderall.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.900]   Many of you are probably familiar with Vyvanse.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.820]   Vyvanse is a commercial name
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.920]   for what many people think is extended-release Adderall,
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.480]   but actually, Vyvanse is not extended-release Adderall.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.900]   Vyvanse is a drug in which the pharmaceutical industry
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.480]   has taken one component of Adderall,
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.220]   just the D-amphetamine component,
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.940]   and attached to it an amino acid called lysine.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.240]   Now, the amino acid lysine is a big amino acid,
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.360]   and the attaching of lysine to D-amphetamine,
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.980]   what we call Vyvanse, makes it what's called a prodrug.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.740]   It actually can't have any effect on its own.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.420]   But when one takes Vyvanse and it's broken down in the gut,
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.420]   but to a greater extent, actually, in the bloodstream,
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.700]   the lysines are cleaved off slowly over time.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.400]   And as a consequence, Vyvanse is basically timed-release
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.940]   D-amphetamine.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.100]   Okay, this is important because I think a lot of people
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.640]   think that Adderall, which, again,
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.120]   is D-amphetamine and L-amphetamine,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.500]   and those two things operate quite a bit differently
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.820]   at the level of norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.260]   and cardiac versus brain effects.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.360]   A lot of people think Vyvanse is just slow-release Adderall,
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.440]   but it is not.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.740]   What Vyvanse is is it's D-amphetamine only,
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.300]   but in time-release form.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.080]   And Vyvanse was actually developed as a way
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.820]   to try and get around or rather prevent
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.640]   some of the abuse potential of Adderall
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.940]   and other drugs that contain D-amphetamine.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.220]   D-amphetamine stands for dextro-amphetamine.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.980]   And in the '70s and '80s,
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.220]   there were a fair amount of movies
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.740]   and there was a lot of trafficking
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:12.360]   and there was a lot of criminal activity
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.700]   related to what was called dexedrine.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.180]   Dexedrine is pure D-amphetamine.
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.960]   So if we're going to be very direct,
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.860]   if I were going to just frame these things
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.120]   in the context of their neurochemistry,
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.060]   what I can tell you is that Vyvanse
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.500]   is time-release dexedrine.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.500]   Okay, it's not time-release Adderall.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.900]   Now, just because there were movies
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.400]   and reports of criminal activity related to dexedrine,
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.920]   that doesn't necessarily mean that dexedrine
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.980]   is not an effective and useful pharmaceutical.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.580]   In fact, Vyvanse, which is time-release dexedrine,
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.380]   has proved to be very effective in the treatment of ADHD
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.940]   for a lot of people.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.260]   And the reason for that is this time-release
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.220]   does indeed prevent abuse in the sense that
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.280]   despite people's many attempts, from what I hear,
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.260]   to increase the rate of entry of the D-amphetamine
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.140]   into their system by either snorting it
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.280]   or, God forbid, even injecting it and things of that sort,
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.900]   the attaching of that lysine to D-amphetamine
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.540]   really does slow the absorption.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.140]   So when somebody takes Vyvanse,
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.020]   and hopefully people are taking it responsibly,
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.420]   when they take Vyvanse, what they're really getting
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.740]   is a slow trickle of D-amphetamine into their system
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.840]   and therefore a slow, long-lasting increase
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.380]   in dopamine and norepinephrine.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.500]   And indeed, that's what happens.
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.500]   The effects of Vyvanse can extend over anywhere
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.220]   from 12 to 16, sometimes even 18 hours,
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.460]   depending on how quickly somebody metabolizes it.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.180]   And I should say that there's no way to predict
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.240]   how quickly one will metabolize any of these drugs
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.320]   except by trying them.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.940]   That's one of the sort of downsides
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.500]   of the state of things these days.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.480]   There's no blood test or enzymatic test
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.660]   that will tell you whether or not
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.140]   you're going to be a fast metabolizer or a slow metabolizer.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:53.180]   And that's why people just have to sort through
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.500]   different dosages, which we'll talk about in a little bit.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.340]   They have to sort through
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.260]   different types of sympathomimetics, you know?
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.780]   Some people try Adderall, and they find that, you know,
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.100]   the quick time course of Adderall,
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.700]   or at least quick for them of about six to eight hours,
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.820]   is just too fast, and then it wears off
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.460]   and they get into a slump in the afternoon.
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.540]   Other people will find that one Adderall taken at 6 a.m.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.960]   will have them going all day long and into the night,
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.520]   and it's just too much stimulation,
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.660]   and they need to come way, way down in dose,
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.680]   or they need to think about
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.580]   other sympathomimetics for ADHD.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.900]   And we'll talk about what some of those other options are
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.280]   in a little bit as well.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.500]   So the important thing to understand
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.300]   is that Adderall is really two drugs, DNL amphetamine.
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:32.380]   Vyvanse is D-amphetamine, which is also called Dexedrine,
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.820]   but with this time-released aspect
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.980]   created by lumping a lysine on there.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.580]   And you may notice that I haven't mentioned
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.840]   one of the major drugs used to treat ADHD,
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.380]   and that's Ritalin, or what's sometimes also called concerta,
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.700]   depending on, again, the time-release forms, et cetera.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.560]   Ritalin was very commonly prescribed
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.280]   for the treatment of ADHD early in the days
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.100]   of using sympathomimetics in order to treat ADHD.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.800]   So for instance, I went to college in the early '90s.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.500]   So I started college in '93, and I graduated in '98.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.900]   It was one year in there as a,
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.620]   let's call it a transition year.
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.760]   I can recall hearing that Ritalin was being prescribed
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.380]   for ADHD in kids, and I, like many other people,
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.740]   were wondering, what are the long-term consequences
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.980]   of this going to be?
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.460]   I also, like many other people, was very perplexed
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.140]   as to why a stimulant, sympathomimetic like Ritalin,
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.300]   was being prescribed for hyperactive kids.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.740]   That will become clear in a moment,
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:36.100]   but we don't hear so much about Ritalin nowadays,
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.060]   and I think that's because Adderall and Vyvanse
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.160]   and things like them have become so popular
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.300]   for the treatment of ADHD.
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:47.840]   It's worth noting that Ritalin is not actually amphetamine.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.180]   Ritalin is what's called methylphenidate,
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.080]   and methylphenidate works in a lot of ways
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.460]   that are similar to the way that Adderall and Vyvanse work,
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.460]   but there are certain ways in which it's different.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.980]   Now, Ritalin, methylphenidate,
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.600]   does increase dopamine transmission at synapses,
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.980]   and it does so also by inhibiting the function
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.380]   of that presynaptic dopamine transporter
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.560]   that would otherwise suck more dopamine back up
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.920]   into the presynaptic cell.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.720]   Methylphenidate, Ritalin, also disrupts the activity
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.020]   of the noradrenergic transporter,
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.860]   leading to net increases
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.180]   in the amount of norepinephrine at the synapse,
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.660]   but it is not as much a potent inhibitor
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.620]   of the noradrenergic transporter,
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.040]   and therefore most of the effect of methylphenidate
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.300]   is to increase dopamine at synapses.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.360]   A lot of people don't realize this.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.860]   A lot of people think that Ritalin
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.360]   is just very short-acting Adderall, and that's not the case.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.260]   It is true that Ritalin, at least in its standard form,
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.100]   tends to have a pretty short half-life,
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.260]   and therefore its effects basically kick in
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.500]   about 20 to 40 minutes after taking it,
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.500]   sometimes a little bit sooner, sometimes a little later,
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.360]   and they last about four to six hours,
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.300]   as opposed to the six to eight hours typical of Adderall,
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.460]   but Ritalin is not short-acting Adderall.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.900]   Ritalin is mainly increasing dopamine,
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.720]   and to some extent, norepinephrine at synapses,
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.900]   whereas Adderall and Vyvanse are increasing
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:22.020]   both dopamine and norepinephrine to a much greater extent,
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.140]   and for those of you that are interested
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.920]   in the underlying cell biological reason for that,
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.980]   it has something to do with Ritalin's
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:31.540]   relatively lower affinity for the noradrenergic transporter,
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.620]   but it's also because, remember,
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.900]   I listed off three mechanisms by which Adderall
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.900]   and by extension, Vyvanse, increased dopamine
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.260]   and norepinephrine transmission, right?
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.500]   Disruption of the transporter, disruption of the VMAT2,
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.860]   as well as a disruption of the whole kind of complex
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.980]   of communication between those proteins.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.640]   Well, Ritalin is really only tapping into the drug's ability
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.580]   to disrupt the dopamine and noradrenergic transporter,
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.380]   so it's three mechanisms of increasing dopamine
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.400]   and norepinephrine for Adderall and Vyvanse,
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.300]   and by extension, Dexedrine,
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.660]   and it's only one mechanism for Ritalin
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.580]   to increase dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.920]   and therein, mostly dopamine.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.580]   So if we take a step back for a moment from all these drugs
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:17.300]   and all this cell biology of neurons and so forth,
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.240]   and we go back to the brain networks involved in attention,
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.580]   remember the orchestra model or the teacher model
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.820]   where the prefrontal cortex really sits in top seat
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.420]   in terms of coordinating the actions,
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.020]   both the shh, the quieting, and the yes, please speak
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:34.020]   actions of the brain, really bringing about what we think of
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.060]   as focused attention and task switching,
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.900]   all the stuff that goes along with learning
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.860]   and focus and cognition.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:45.340]   Well, what we know is that dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.620]   which are differentially increased by these different drugs
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.580]   that we've been talking about,
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.420]   also differentially impact the various aspects
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.240]   of executive function of the prefrontal cortex,
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.980]   increasing our attention for specific things.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.580]   And while there is a lot of nuance in the literature
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.300]   about this, we can safely say a couple of things.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:10.300]   First of all, increasing dopamine at particular synapses
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.820]   and networks in the brain can serve
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.900]   as what's called noise reduction.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.980]   It can help further enhance the quieting
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.100]   of all that background stuff.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.900]   That background stuff can be attention to things
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.320]   in your environment like noises or visual cues.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.860]   It could be some internal narrative
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.060]   that you had about yesterday
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.700]   or something that somebody said about you
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.980]   or something that somebody you like
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.140]   would like to say about you
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.820]   or whatever it might be that's happening in your head
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.260]   that's distracting you,
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.380]   as well as your representation of your internal bodily state,
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.860]   what we call interoception.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.540]   This is a really important aspect of attention
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.960]   that we don't often hear about,
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.260]   which is that we have the ability to attend to things
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.740]   outside of us, which is called exteroception,
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:57.340]   as well as an ability to attend to things inside of us,
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.940]   which include things like thoughts,
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.740]   but also includes, you know, for instance,
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.540]   how empty or full our gut feels,
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.420]   whether or not we're comfortable in our chair.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.780]   You know, and when we think about the practice of focus
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.240]   and learning or focusing as a verb,
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.820]   it involves often forcing ourselves to sit still.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.940]   It often involves us suppressing the fact
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.600]   that our foot is a little bit cramped
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.620]   or that we might need to use the restroom for, you know,
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.820]   we might want to delay that for 10, 15 minutes,
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.580]   even though it might be fairly urgent.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.580]   All these sorts of things are central
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.140]   to our ability to attend and focus.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.860]   And so dopamine,
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.220]   while it does many different things in the brain,
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.580]   many, many different things,
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.140]   one of its main functions in the context
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.700]   of all this prefrontal cortex and attention stuff
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.340]   is to quiet the amount of noise.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.020]   That is, it helps the prefrontal cortex
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:53.100]   suppress the signals that would otherwise distract us
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.380]   into thinking about, oh yeah, I'm kind of thirsty right now,
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.500]   or I need to use the restroom,
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.420]   or I really want to make this call,
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.580]   or I really want to pick up my phone.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.740]   All of that stuff, all of that suppression,
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.660]   that shh, that quieting down of all the background chatter
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.660]   related to things external and internal to us in our head
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.660]   and our body is greatly facilitated
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.640]   by having more dopamine present in the synapses
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.780]   that allow for what we call noise reduction.
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.420]   Now, in parallel to that is norepinephrine.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.860]   Norepinephrine is released from multiple sites
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:23.840]   in the brain and body,
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.000]   but within the brain, there's one major site of neurons
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.660]   that manufacture norepinephrine,
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.560]   and the name of that site is locus coeruleus.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.760]   It sits in the back of the brain.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.020]   It's actually a relatively small collection of neurons,
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.920]   but they are very, very powerful.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.820]   They extend their little axons, their wires,
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.500]   to multiple locations in the brain,
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.800]   and they release norepinephrine at those locations.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.600]   So think of them sort of as a sprinkler system
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.720]   that originates from one very focal location,
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.340]   but that can sprinkle norepinephrine
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.420]   at multiple locations in the brain.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.780]   And the amazing thing about locus coeruleus
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.940]   and that sprinkler system is that indeed
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.100]   the sprinkler system can be pretty widespread
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.760]   where everywhere there's a sprinkler head,
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.420]   somebody's getting norepinephrine,
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.900]   but it also can fairly focally release norepinephrine
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.100]   at particular sites.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.300]   So while in the context of today's discussion,
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:22.300]   dopamine is acting largely to impart noise reduction,
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:27.380]   norepinephrine has the ability to boost signals at synapses,
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.560]   to increase the amplitude
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.020]   and frequency of communication between neurons.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.060]   And in that way, in the context of today's discussion,
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:39.100]   norepinephrine, when released at the particular synapses
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.540]   in the particular brain networks
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.680]   that are related to attention and learning,
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.600]   is largely serving to increase signal.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.700]   So what we have in the context of a drug
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.520]   like Adderall or Vyvanse,
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.140]   or to some extent methylphenidate,
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.740]   Ritalin does this as well,
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.700]   is an increase in dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.380]   that is leading to two things,
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:00.660]   both a reduction in noise, a quieting of the circuitry
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.260]   that we don't want to hear so much from,
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.920]   and an increase in the signal of the networks
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.860]   that we do want to pay attention to.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.020]   And the net effect of that noise reduction
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.860]   and signal amplification is what the engineers refer to as
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.820]   increased signal to noise.
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:21.100]   And the consequence of that is a heightened subjective sense
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.600]   or ability to decide what we want to focus on,
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.140]   sit down or stand there, and just focus on it.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.980]   So the way that we've been discussing drugs to treat ADHD
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.340]   and their ability to increase dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:38.220]   and thereby to reduce the amount of noise, so to speak,
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.940]   in the brain, and to increase the amount of signal
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.740]   related to things that we want to attend to,
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.980]   all presumes that the amount of dopamine
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.000]   and the amount of norepinephrine that's being increased
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.140]   is perfect for what we want to accomplish,
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.340]   which is increased focus
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.120]   and reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.240]   But of course, in the real world, that's not always the case
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.760]   depending on the dosage of the drug,
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.760]   one sensitivity to the drug,
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.200]   even what stage of development across the lifespan
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.580]   a person is at, things can really go haywire pretty fast.
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:14.300]   And what I'm referring to when I say haywire is,
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.600]   if you think about dopamine and its ability to reduce noise,
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.060]   well, dopamine does a bunch of other things as well.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:24.100]   And in fact, we know that if dopamine is increased too much
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.820]   in the brain of somebody that has ADHD
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.040]   or somebody that doesn't have ADHD,
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.940]   people can become euphoric, people can become manic,
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.580]   people can even become psychotic.
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.020]   Likewise, if norepinephrine is increased too much,
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.580]   people won't just become alert,
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.640]   they will become very anxious, have panic attacks,
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.440]   and depending on the drug they're taking,
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.900]   they may even experience very serious peripheral symptoms,
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.600]   meaning elevated heart rate and sweating
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.320]   that is super uncomfortable and on and on.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.400]   So everything I've been discussing up until now is true,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.080]   but I want to make it clear that it's true in the context
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:02.080]   of appropriately dosed prescribed drug for a given condition
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.480]   which leads us to the next question,
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.400]   which is why would it be that giving these drugs
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.380]   which are in fact stimulants,
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.040]   why would that calm a kid down?
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.720]   Why would that calm an adult with ADHD down?
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.900]   And the answer to that is not completely straightforward
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:21.040]   and it is worth pointing out that not everyone with ADHD
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.600]   has impulsivity and hyperactivity
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.880]   and therefore an inability to focus.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.540]   Some kids and adults with ADHD do have challenges
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:32.420]   with impulsivity and hyperactivity, some do not.
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.900]   Some just have challenges with focus.
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.080]   And I did an entire episode about ADHD
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.420]   and we are going to have an expert guest on this podcast
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.460]   who specializes in the treatment of ADHD
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.680]   to talk about some of these issues further.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.680]   But I just want to remind everybody
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.560]   that as in the general population,
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.060]   children and adults with ADHD are capable
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.780]   of very concentrated periods of focus.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.960]   The pattern however, tends to be that children and adults
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   with ADHD have a harder time getting into that state of focus
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.240]   and perhaps most importantly, they have a very hard time
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.760]   getting into a forced state of focus
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.160]   for things that they don't enjoy doing.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.920]   I'm sure many of you are also thinking,
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.700]   wait, I don't like to do certain things
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.280]   and it's harder to focus on those things
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.360]   than on the things I like.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.420]   Of course, does that mean I have ADHD?
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.540]   And the answer is not necessarily so.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:27.040]   Kids and adults with ADHD exhibit an extreme variation
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.720]   in their ability to focus such that if there's something
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.960]   they really, really like doing, they can indeed focus.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.680]   However, for many, many other activities
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.880]   that are required in order to develop,
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.280]   I guess we'll just call it normal life advancement.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.360]   So sitting still, listening to conversations
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.800]   that we may or may not be particularly interested in,
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.720]   that's where the challenge has come about.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.760]   So the point is that these brain networks
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.200]   and these neuromodulators like dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.560]   that we've been talking about in fairly straightforward
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.700]   terms as it relates to a drug's ability
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.320]   to increase their transmission and therefore
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.660]   an improved ability to focus presumes two things.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.700]   It presumes that the dosing is right,
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.800]   that is that the levels of increases
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.040]   in these neuromodulators is just right.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.680]   And I also just want to acknowledge that ADHD is,
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:16.040]   first of all, not an inability to focus at all.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.760]   It is immense challenges in focusing
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.140]   on lots of different things as required
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.040]   for normal life progression.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:28.120]   And it's also the case that there is no one specific pattern
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.720]   of ADHD that applies to everyone with ADHD.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.180]   Some people, both kids and adults,
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.040]   will exhibit the hyperactivity, but not the impulsivity,
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.200]   although those two things tend to go hand in hand.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.100]   Some people will have a challenge in focus
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:42.560]   without hyperactivity, impulsivity, and so forth.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.060]   And all of this just really speaks
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.740]   to the complexity of ADHD, and yet,
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:50.560]   and yet we can confidently say that there are more drugs
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.980]   to treat ADHD than any other psychiatric condition.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.240]   We've talked about a few of those now,
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.680]   but among those, Adderall, Vyvanse, Ritalin,
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.020]   also called methylphenidate, there are time-release versions.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.200]   There are different variations
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.920]   on those time-release versions.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:09.280]   There's even straight Dexedrine, which is prescribed
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.340]   for ADHD in some cases, and on and on.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:14.140]   And you might also find it interesting to know
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.040]   that that very large kit of drugs, all of which,
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.400]   at least the ones we've talked about so far,
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.800]   are sympathomimetics, are stimulants,
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:26.020]   are more effective at treating ADHD
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.940]   than are any other collection of drugs
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.080]   for treating other psychiatric disorders.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.320]   So what all of that diversity of symptomology and ADHD,
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.960]   as well as differences in sensitivity to drugs
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.200]   and individual variation, what all of that speaks to
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.800]   is that the large kit of drugs that's out there
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.040]   is designed to be assessed with the careful consult
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.120]   of a very qualified psychiatrist
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.080]   in order to allow the child or adult
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.640]   to arrive at the specific drug and the specific dosage
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:58.080]   that's ideal for their particular pattern of ADHD.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.840]   And that issue actually gives rise to the answer
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.280]   to that now somewhat age-old question
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.440]   as to why giving stimulants to a kid that is hyperactive
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   would calm them down.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:11.000]   And the answer is that the hyperactivity, impulsivity,
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.880]   and focus issues present in ADHD in children and adults
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:20.680]   are the consequence not necessarily of deficient activity
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.480]   of neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex,
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.920]   or deficient activity of the default mode network,
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.420]   or deficient activity of the salience network, et cetera.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.640]   What appears to be the case
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.000]   based on a lot of high quality neuroimaging data
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.720]   is that the brains of children and adults with ADHD
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.580]   have all of these networks functioning,
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.920]   but those networks are actually hyper-connected.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.160]   That is, they tend to be co-active
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.400]   at times when ordinarily,
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.260]   meaning in kids and adults without ADHD,
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.860]   they would not be co-active.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.320]   So that's an important point
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.920]   because it's easy to get the impression
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:03.080]   that ADHD is just a deficiency in dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.420]   and that's simply not the case.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.780]   If you recall, dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.200]   are neuromodulators.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.040]   They modulate the activity of other neural circuits,
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.960]   and they can both increase and decrease activity
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.040]   within those circuits.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.080]   So you don't necessarily want to think about dopamine
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.560]   and norepinephrine just as molecules
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.640]   that increase neural activity.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.560]   And you certainly don't want to think about ADHD
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.700]   as just a deficiency in dopamine
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:27.900]   or deficiency in norepinephrine.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.440]   The way these drugs work
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.220]   when they are used effectively to treat ADHD
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.620]   is to tune the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.500]   that are present in particular brain networks
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.660]   in order to allow the person to arrive
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.340]   at just the right balance between the activation
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.020]   of these different neural circuits,
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.420]   causing them largely to be less synchronous in their firing.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.820]   So this takes us back to this question
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.940]   of why giving stimulants to a kid would calm them down.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:57.240]   It's not so much that you're giving a stimulant to a kid
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.480]   to place them into a state of calm.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.400]   I think that's a common misconception.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.280]   Rather, by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.660]   these drugs, yes, increase levels
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.160]   of overall autonomic arousal.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.040]   They are, after all, sympathomimetics.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:15.260]   But more importantly to the treatment of ADHD symptoms,
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.720]   you are activating the prefrontal cortex
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.420]   in a way that allows it to be more of a coordinator,
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.080]   of that orchestra conductor,
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.760]   or if you prefer the analogy to a teacher in the classroom,
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.820]   to ramp up the activity of certain neural circuits
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:30.640]   in a given moment and quiet down the activity
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.500]   of other neural circuits such that the default mode network
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.260]   can still perform its incredible actions.
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.480]   After all, the default mode network is involved
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.200]   not just in self-referencing and kind of daydreaming,
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.880]   but also creativity and imagination.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.940]   That's been well described in the literature,
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.000]   as well as the salience network and these other networks
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.440]   that are designed to drop us
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.940]   into very narrow trenches of attention.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:57.040]   These drugs for the treatment of ADHD are indeed stimulants,
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.180]   but the goal of prescribing these drugs
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:04.180]   to a child or adult with ADHD is to adjust dosage, timing,
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:06.920]   and the duration over which somebody takes it
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.300]   in their lifespan in order to allow those neural circuits
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.300]   to work in the proper way,
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.640]   meaning for the conductor to activate the instruments
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:18.640]   in that little symphony or band in the appropriate order
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.760]   in order to arrive at the right music
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.840]   as opposed to all the instruments playing at once,
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.560]   which would just be complete noise.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.820]   Or again, if you prefer the classroom teaching analogy
[00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.520]   for the teacher to call on one student
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.600]   while the others are quiet
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.960]   and then to call on a different student,
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.280]   have one student return to their seats
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.940]   to have the students work in small groups.
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.320]   Again, all of this by analogy,
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.640]   the point being that dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.220]   are all allowing these networks to be activated
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.800]   to the precisely correct levels
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.320]   and in the precisely correct sequence.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.400]   Now, the other key aspect of drugs like Adderall,
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:55.600]   5-ants, Ritalin, and similar to treat ADHD
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.040]   has everything to do with these neuromodulators,
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.800]   dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.280]   but it has to do with their other incredible feature
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.800]   besides just their ability to reduce noise
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.120]   and increase signal within these brain networks.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.540]   And that incredibly important feature
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.480]   is what we call neuroplasticity
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.720]   or the brain and nervous system's ability to change
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.680]   in response to experience.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.140]   I've done entire episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:23.440]   on neuroplasticity, what it is and how to access it
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.960]   at different stages of development and in adulthood.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.700]   By the way, you can find those episodes at HubermanLab.com
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.640]   by simply searching plasticity in the search function.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:35.800]   But the important thing to understand about plasticity
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.080]   in the context of today's discussion
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.580]   is that while there are many different ways
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.200]   to induce neuroplasticity,
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.840]   almost all of them, almost all of them
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:50.840]   involve strongly activating certain brain networks.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:56.220]   And in that case, also strong or elevated release
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.360]   of certain neuromodulators.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:01.640]   Now we've talked about dopamine and norepinephrine.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:04.860]   They are but two of many neuromodulators.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.360]   Others include serotonin, acetylcholine,
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:10.140]   and each of the neuromodulators does different things
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.900]   at different synapses in the brain.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.220]   And there's some global statements
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.640]   that can be made about each of them.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.900]   We made some of those earlier,
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:19.040]   like dopamine is broadly involved in motivation,
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:22.660]   craving and pursuit, and norepinephrine in signal detection
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:25.160]   and drawing a focus or salience
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.520]   to something in our environment
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.160]   or in our body or inner experience.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.300]   Serotonin does other things.
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.920]   Acetylcholine does other things.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.260]   But what's really important to understand
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:40.120]   is that any time there is a dramatic elevation
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.040]   in dopamine and norepinephrine relative to baseline,
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.920]   relative to what was happening
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.060]   with dopamine and norepinephrine just prior to that,
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:53.040]   that has a tendency to promote neuroplasticity
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.000]   at particular synapses.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.100]   So here's where it's appropriate to remind everybody
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:01.120]   that neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.640]   Neurotransmitters are chemicals
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.480]   that just like dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.760]   are released between neurons,
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.920]   and they are what actually contribute
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.880]   to the electrical signals going up or down
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.840]   between different neurons.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.320]   And again, dopamine and norepinephrine modulate
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.600]   that activity, causing a given amount of neurotransmitter
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:21.480]   to have an even greater effect, for instance.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.500]   So when we hear about dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.920]   and we hear about motivation or focus, et cetera,
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.400]   that's all fine and good.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.860]   But it's also important to remember
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:34.000]   that when dopamine and norepinephrine are increased,
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.880]   there is a higher probability of strengthening connections
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.100]   where dopamine and norepinephrine are increased.
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:42.840]   And what that means is that later,
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.280]   even if levels of dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:49.080]   are not increased, if they go back to baseline,
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:53.280]   it's often the case that if in our prior history
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:56.640]   or the history of a given set of neurons in our brain,
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.360]   there was more dopamine or norepinephrine around,
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.500]   it's very likely that the connections
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.380]   where that took place are strengthened
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.540]   and therefore more easily activated.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:10.560]   And this takes us back to the really original purpose
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.100]   of prescribing these sympathomimetic stimulants
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.800]   to children with ADHD during development.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:19.740]   It was, yes, designed to try and help them focus,
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.820]   to reduce their hyperactivity and help them focus.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:26.120]   But it was also designed to help the brain networks
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.420]   that are responsible for focus to undergo neuroplasticity,
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:32.400]   that is, for the synapses involved to strengthen
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.240]   so that those networks could function more efficiently
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.340]   later on, even after cessation of the drug.
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.460]   This is an absolutely crucial point
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.000]   that I think is not often discussed
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.860]   when people, for instance, say,
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.980]   "Should I put my kid on ADHD meds
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:50.520]   "or should I take my kid off of ADHD meds
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.940]   "as they transition from adolescence
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.580]   "to their later teen years and into college?"
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.300]   I mean, after all, no child or parent,
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.620]   or adult for that matter,
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.040]   wants to achieve a bunch of benefits with a drug
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.100]   and then lose those benefits later.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:09.620]   Nor does any parent or child want to take a drug
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.380]   that they don't need to take
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.340]   when they could access other routes
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:15.480]   to improving the neural circuitry
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.640]   or the function of some health system in the body,
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.740]   because I don't think anyone really wants
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:21.740]   to medicate their kids unless they have to.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:22.740]   I would hope not.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:24.560]   And I don't think any kid wants to be medicated
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.740]   unless they absolutely need to be medicated.
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.300]   So increasing dopamine and norepinephrine with these drugs,
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:33.180]   like Adderall, Vyvanse, Ritalin, and similar,
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:34.660]   is causing several things.
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:37.780]   And some of those things actually provide
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:40.660]   some general answers as to whether or not parents
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:44.000]   should put their kids on these compounds in the first place.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.200]   Obviously, they're going to do that
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.060]   under the careful consult of a qualified psychiatrist,
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:51.860]   I would hope, and only under those circumstances,
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.220]   but also whether or not the child
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.620]   should stay on those drugs over time.
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:58.080]   And here's what we do know for sure.
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.220]   I did a vast search within the literature
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:04.460]   in order to arrive at what is very clear,
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:09.180]   which is that children with ADHD, true ADHD,
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:12.800]   who are diagnosed with ADHD and are treated
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.520]   with appropriate doses of drugs like Adderall,
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.220]   Ritalin, or Vyvanse,
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:24.300]   fare far better both in childhood and later in life
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.540]   when it comes to performance in school,
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:30.060]   performance in terms of focusing on anything,
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.060]   and in terms of general outcomes.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.940]   So for instance, a lot of people have wondered
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.420]   and worried about whether or not treatment
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:40.840]   with these drugs early in life will set up a predisposition
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.200]   for illicit drug abuse
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.820]   or craving an addictive potential later.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:48.100]   And it is very clear from the studies that have emerged
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.540]   over the last really 15 years,
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:53.260]   but mainly within the last five years,
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.580]   'cause that's when most of the data have arrived,
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:01:00.580]   that children with ADHD who are not treated correctly,
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.660]   both with drugs and behavioral treatments,
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.160]   because really the combination of drugs
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.840]   and behavioral treatments is the optimal situation.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.320]   So kids with ADHD who are not treated
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.820]   with drugs and behavioral treatments
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:18.180]   to deal with their ADHD have a much higher tendency
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:22.120]   towards illicit drug use and addictive drug potential
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.680]   in their adulthood, okay?
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.380]   So there is a real danger
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.100]   to not treating ADHD during childhood.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.620]   And the reverse is also true,
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.100]   which is that children with ADHD
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:36.020]   who take prescription drugs that are sympathomimetics,
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.820]   so yes, as you've heard, they are speed,
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.420]   amphetamine is speed,
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.940]   although I should say if they take methylphenidate,
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.440]   Ritalin or Concerta or something of that sort,
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.100]   that's not amphetamine.
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.540]   Nonetheless, it's a stimulant,
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.120]   it's a sympathomimetic also.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.480]   These are kids that are taking these drugs
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.200]   during development and therefore levels of dopamine,
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.000]   levels of norepinephrine are being increased
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   in their brain and body.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.320]   And you might say, well,
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.800]   wouldn't that lead to a craving
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.240]   for these things later in life?
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.160]   And that does not appear to be the case.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.200]   In fact, there's some very nice neuroimaging studies,
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.320]   mainly positron emission tomography studies
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.360]   that I'll provide a link to in the show note captions
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.020]   that show the early treatment with these drugs
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.240]   actually leads to combinations
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.320]   of increased dopamine transmission
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.920]   in the forebrain later in life at a lower level
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.360]   or a lower threshold, I should say,
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.660]   in a way that essentially says there's normalization
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.240]   of the circuits across time
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.560]   by the application of these drugs early in life.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.300]   Again, in the case of children that have diagnosed ADHD,
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:40.040]   I in no way, shape or form want to imply
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.480]   that all children should be treated with these drugs.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.280]   That is quite clearly not going to be a good idea.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.800]   So all of this really speaks to the critical importance
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.640]   of getting an accurate diagnosis of ADHD.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.960]   Diagnostic criteria include many things in children.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.640]   There are multiple, there are more than nine
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.360]   diagnostic criteria for each of the categories
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.080]   relating to impulsivity, hyperactivity, and so on.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.740]   So a well-qualified psychiatrist will do several things.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.620]   They will, first of all,
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:12.720]   do a careful diagnostic evaluation of a child.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.660]   And in addition, one would hope that they would think about
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.740]   prescribing both appropriate pharmacologic treatments
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:22.240]   for ADHD, but also be aware of and prescribe
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.680]   the various other types of prescriptions,
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.120]   meaning behavioral prescriptions.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.140]   So there are clearly certain learning tools
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.920]   and things that kids can do
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.120]   in order to improve their ability to focus
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.880]   and to be less impulsive
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.500]   that combine especially well with drug treatments,
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.920]   as well as new advancements in the realm of nutrition
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.280]   and supplementation that are constantly coming online.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.400]   And the best psychiatrists are going to be tuned in
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.800]   to all of those aspects of treatment for ADHD,
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.600]   not just prescription drugs, but also behavioral treatments,
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.720]   also nutritional guidelines, also supplementation,
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.680]   and also updating each and all of those things
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.200]   as a child matures from each stage
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.240]   of development to the next.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.440]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.120]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.400]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.040]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.520]   to help you better understand your body
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.360]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.160]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.320]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.940]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.880]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.340]   however, is that they'll give you information
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.500]   about certain lipid markers or hormone markers,
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.560]   but no information about what to do with all of that data.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.920]   InsideTracker makes it very easy
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.400]   to look at your levels of hormones,
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.600]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.000]   and then to assess what sorts of behavioral,
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.420]   nutritional, supplementation,
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.820]   or perhaps other interventions you might want to use
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.760]   in order to bring those numbers into the ranges
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.280]   that are optimal for your health.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.320]   InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.880]   three new hormone markers that are critical to measure
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.400]   during a woman's reproductive and menopausal years.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.280]   These are estradiol, progesterone,
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.180]   and thyroid stimulating hormone.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.580]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.500]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.160]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.740]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:14.320]   Now, the other common question is,
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.720]   if a child has been treated
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.040]   with these ADHD meds during development,
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.240]   do they need to continue on those drugs indefinitely?
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:25.260]   And the short answer to this is it depends,
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.760]   and that can be a somewhat frustrating answer, I realize,
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.200]   but the good news is it's something that can be assessed
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.620]   in a fairly straightforward way.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.220]   Let's recall that the use of these drugs to treat ADHD
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.400]   is designed to accomplish two things.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.360]   It's designed to improve the function
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.160]   of those neural circuits that allow a child to focus,
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.120]   and it's also designed to increase the strength
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.080]   of those circuits to effectively teach the circuits
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.440]   how to learn what focus is.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.040]   In other words, these drugs are designed,
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.800]   in some cases, to be used and then withdrawn later
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.520]   because the circuits that they helped build up
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.720]   are functioning well.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.280]   In some cases, however, the circuits that underlie focus
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.640]   are not going to be able to function at the level required
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.980]   for normal healthy life progression
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.940]   unless there's continued application of the drug.
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.700]   So how would this work in the real world context?
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:24.620]   Well, I think any child or adolescent
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.740]   or person younger than 25 that's taken these drugs
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:32.340]   has no doubt achieved some level of neuroplasticity
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.780]   of the neural circuits related to all the things
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.540]   we call focus, and I want to be very clear.
[01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:40.420]   There is no single brain area or set of brain circuits
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:42.900]   for what I'm referring to as focus
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:45.420]   because after all, focus involves task switching,
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:48.800]   focus involves all sorts of different cognitive operations
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.880]   depending on what we're focusing on, right?
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:55.080]   Focusing on a sport is basically a practice
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.020]   of directing one's attention in different locations
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:58.860]   at different moments.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.260]   Focusing on studying is an entirely different pattern
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.560]   of focus altogether, but the point being,
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.660]   if a person 25 years or younger takes a drug
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.880]   that increases dopamine and norepinephrine
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.520]   and assuming that things are working,
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.560]   meaning the dose is right,
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.400]   they're achieving better ability to focus, et cetera,
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.560]   those circuits are going to get stronger,
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.900]   and it seems entirely reasonable.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.800]   In fact, it was supported by the psychiatrist
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.420]   that I spoke to prior to this episode
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:30.300]   that people who have been on ADHD meds
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.720]   for any point of time prior to 25
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.300]   talk to their psychiatrist
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.400]   about what tapering off those drugs
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.640]   in order to examine whether or not
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.200]   they still need those drugs would look like.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.880]   Now, I mentioned the word taper
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.560]   because there is a withdrawal potential
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.560]   of simply stopping these drugs very quickly
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:53.160]   because they do ramp up dopamine and norepinephrine.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.600]   Even though they increase plasticity of the neural circuits
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.160]   for focus and mood and motivation,
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:02.720]   if one very abruptly ceases taking any of these drugs,
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.960]   it does not feel good.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:08.040]   That drop in dopamine that one inevitably experiences
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.000]   is almost always associated with lethargy,
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.680]   with depressed mood,
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.660]   with feeling not good in a number of ways,
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.200]   and of course, challenges in focus.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.080]   So anytime one is going to go off one of these drugs
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.360]   or sample what it is to even reduce dosage,
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.520]   that has to be done in close communication
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.800]   with a board-certified psychiatrist.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.720]   At the same time, it was made very clear to me
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.840]   from ADHD expert psychiatrist
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.080]   that reductions in dosage over time
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:38.480]   often are optimal for a patient, okay?
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.360]   And this gets to the whole issue of dosage generally.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.300]   You know, I spend a good amount of time
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:45.680]   talking to somebody who prescribes these drugs,
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.840]   both to children and adults, about dosage ranges.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.480]   And I don't want to spend too much time on this
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:54.060]   from the perspective of how much one should take.
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.680]   In fact, I don't want anyone to think
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:56.920]   that what I'm about to say
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.600]   should dictate what they should take specifically
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.520]   because that's something that really has to be worked out
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.220]   on an individual basis.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:06.200]   But it is worth noting that if you look at the studies
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.860]   on Adderall and methylphenidate,
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:13.600]   what you'll see is a pretty broad range in those studies.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.100]   And that's because some of the studies used people
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:19.720]   that were already taking these drugs
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.760]   and asked them to participate in neuroimaging studies.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:25.340]   Other studies actually put people on these drugs
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:28.100]   for the very first time or adjusted their dosage.
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.640]   And so you'll see a tremendous range
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:31.980]   of drug doses explored.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:34.560]   For instance, you will see anywhere
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.120]   from 10 to 40 milligrams of Adderall per day.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.740]   You'll see anywhere from 10 to 60 milligrams
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.200]   of Ritalin per day.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.520]   And here we could easily be talking about studies
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.780]   on children or adults.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:49.280]   With respect to Vyvanse,
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.880]   you'll see that the dosages tend to be much higher.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.480]   In part, that's because Vyvanse has, if you recall,
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.520]   it's that lysine, which is a big molecule
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.120]   stuck on d-amphetamine, which is a smaller molecule.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.320]   And so the dosages of Vyvanse tend to be
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.420]   in the hundreds of milligram ranges,
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:07.860]   but most of that hundred milligrams of Vyvanse
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.620]   is not going to be the d-amphetamine.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.940]   It's going to be the lysine, which doesn't do anything
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:13.580]   in the context of treating the brain.
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:16.220]   It's just there to control the slow release.
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:18.840]   So it's thought that a hundred milligrams of Vyvanse
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.180]   translates to roughly nine milligrams of Adderall
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:22.020]   and on and on.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.640]   And actually it's pretty hard to translate
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.120]   between dosages of different drugs in any direct way.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.540]   And in speaking with a psychiatrist expert in ADHD
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.000]   in preparation for this episode,
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.560]   he made very clear that it is extremely,
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.500]   extremely difficult to predict how a child or adult
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.900]   will react to a given dosage of any of these drugs.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.540]   So much so in fact that he anecdotally reported to me
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.260]   that one of his patients is a male, 300 pounds,
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:53.040]   diagnosed with ADHD and who achieves tremendous relief
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.340]   from just 2.5 milligrams of Adderall per day.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.940]   And at the same time, he has two patients,
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.840]   both of whom are sisters, so they're genetically related,
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:07.840]   who are in the 120 to 140 pound range
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.800]   who did not respond well at all
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.800]   for the treatment of their ADHD
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.520]   until their dosages were very, very high.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.840]   And if I tell you these dosages,
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.060]   I just want to warn you in advance,
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:21.160]   I'm not suggesting anyone explore these dosages
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.380]   without of course the approval of their psychiatrist.
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:28.000]   Turns out that neither of these two young women responded
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.620]   at all to ADHD medication until they achieved dosages
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.900]   in the range of 180 in the case of one sister
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:39.380]   and 240 milligrams in the case of the other sister per day,
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:42.580]   which is an astronomically high dose on the face of it.
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:43.980]   But this physician, again,
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:47.020]   board certified physician expert in ADHD,
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.460]   verified for me that indeed neither of them
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.860]   experienced any discomfort or side effects
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.740]   that led them to not want to take the drug.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:57.200]   But of course, that amount of Adderall
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.820]   could send somebody else into an absolute psychotic fit,
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.680]   could potentially even cause cardiac arrest.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.100]   I mean, it's remarkable the ranges of Adderall
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:10.260]   that are used effectively in children and adults.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.640]   And this is true for a lot of the other sympathomimetics
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.300]   used to treat ADHD.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:18.240]   And of course, a good psychiatrist will always assess dosage
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.480]   as it relates to positive benefits, relief of symptoms.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:26.380]   So relief of impulsivity, relief of hyperactivity,
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:28.880]   improvements in ability to focus.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.980]   And of course, they are going to consider side effects,
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.260]   any uncomfortable adverse effects
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:37.120]   that come from taking the drug at a given dosage
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.580]   or taking the drug at all.
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.060]   Now, of course, this all begs the question
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:43.480]   of why such tremendous variation is this
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.620]   due to genetic differences in the amount of dopamine
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.640]   or norepinephrine that people make.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.980]   It appears that the major underlying factor
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.980]   for why people require such vastly different dosages
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:57.160]   of these sympathomimetics for the relief of ADHD
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.420]   has to do with the different enzymes
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.360]   or levels of enzymes that people make
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.660]   which metabolize these drugs, both in the brain and body.
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.780]   And unfortunately, there is no simple blood test
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:09.940]   or saliva test or test of any kind
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.620]   that can predict how someone will respond to these drugs.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:16.860]   So the most logical and safe way to assess dosage
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.500]   is to start with the lowest possible effective dose
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.020]   and to increase only as necessary
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:25.080]   in order to achieve the positive benefits
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.380]   while of course paying attention
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.400]   to any side effects that might arise.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.160]   A question that comes up from time to time
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.260]   when discussing the long-term effects
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:35.500]   of drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, and Vyvanse
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.820]   is whether or not they can negatively impact height
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:41.980]   or growth or development in some other way.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:43.780]   This is a logical question to ask
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:47.000]   because after all, these drugs are effectively
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.660]   mimicking stress in the body.
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.960]   And most everyone has heard by now
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.800]   that while stress can help us in the short term,
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.740]   it helps us deploy immune molecules
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.340]   to protect us against infection,
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.260]   it sharpens our visual focus
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:02.300]   and our ability to respond to things for survival,
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:05.760]   chronically elevating our stress over long periods of time,
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.140]   we know reduces the effectiveness of our immune system
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.220]   and can actually cause certain forms of brain degeneration.
[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:15.140]   And while there aren't a lot of longitudinal studies
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:17.860]   on the heights of kids with ADHD,
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:20.060]   and of course we never can tell
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:23.140]   how tall someone would have grown to be
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:24.420]   if they were treated with a drug
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:27.020]   because we don't have a perfect control experiment
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:29.060]   even in the case of identical twin experiments
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:32.140]   and therein there aren't that many of those examples
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.660]   where one twin was treated for ADHD
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.500]   and the other wasn't, et cetera.
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.860]   But here's what we know.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.260]   It does not appear that treatment
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:42.220]   with sympathomimetics during development
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:45.540]   provided the dosages are kept in the appropriate ranges
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.780]   is going to limit overall height.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:51.000]   In fact, if you look at the data,
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.060]   it appears that children with ADHD
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.740]   who are treated with ADHD meds
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:15:00.420]   actually arrive at slightly higher BMIs, body mass indexes,
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:03.340]   compared to age-matched peers.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.380]   Now, of course, body mass index
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:07.980]   doesn't necessarily correlate with height, right?
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.700]   Someone could not achieve a full height
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:13.340]   but could be heavier, either through bone or fat or muscle
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:15.100]   or combination of all three.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.080]   But what we know is that the appropriate use
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.900]   of ADHD meds during development
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:22.840]   is not stunting development in any kind of overall way.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.340]   It's not preventing maturation of the body
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.860]   in ways that are leading to reduced weight
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.460]   or somehow impaired growth overall.
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.900]   With that said, long-term elevations
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.980]   of sympathetic nervous system activity does carry some risk.
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:39.860]   And one of the primary risks that people have wondered about
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.500]   is cardiovascular risk.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.860]   And this makes perfect sense, right?
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.160]   When you increase the activity
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.180]   of the sympathetic nervous system,
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:48.140]   you increase blood pressure, you increase heart rate,
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:51.060]   you increase, in some cases, peripheral sweating,
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.420]   you know, all the things that we associate with stress.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:55.960]   So you can imagine that a child or adult with ADHD
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:59.020]   that takes these sympathomimetics every day,
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:01.040]   even if the dosage is kept in a range
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.840]   that doesn't allow them to experience
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.340]   any immediate untoward side effects,
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.500]   so they're not feeling miserable,
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.720]   they're just feeling like they can focus better.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.700]   But one always wonders what's going on under the hood,
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.260]   so to speak.
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.160]   There is, as far as I know,
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.380]   one major study that's addressed this,
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:21.940]   and the conclusions of that study were a little bit hard
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.540]   to put into a single category.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:29.040]   It did point to a subtle increase in cardiovascular risk,
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.140]   but the results did not point to anything so dramatic
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:36.000]   that the authors of the study warned against
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.720]   taking these drugs or encouraging people
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.200]   to cease taking these drugs,
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.260]   again, provided they're being prescribed
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:43.780]   by a board-certified physician for ADHD
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:46.820]   and at the appropriate dosage for that person.
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:49.220]   That said, I think this all, again,
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.500]   speaks to the importance of arriving
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.500]   at minimal effective dosage.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.540]   And it stands to reason that if you're somebody
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.220]   who's taking ADHD meds,
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:00.140]   or if your child is taking ADHD meds,
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.540]   that one would want to do all the other things
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.140]   that they could do in order to try
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.940]   and improve cardiovascular health,
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.860]   or at least not put it at additional risk.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.580]   So those are going to be the obvious things
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:13.420]   like avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.580]   Regular exercise is going to be encouraged,
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:18.340]   and things of that sort.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.300]   And that dovetails into a bunch of other questions
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:23.500]   that are often asked any time the topic of Adderall
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:27.500]   or Ritalin comes up, which is, what about alcohol?
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.940]   You know, is drinking alcohol at the same time
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:34.180]   or at different times even going to be problematic
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.100]   if one is taking these drugs?
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.540]   Is taking benzodiazepines going to be a problem,
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.280]   et cetera, et cetera?
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.820]   There's a very straightforward answer to this,
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.620]   which is it's very clear that alcohol,
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:48.380]   certainly in children, but also in adults,
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.860]   is best not consumed.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.340]   I did an entire episode about alcohol,
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.620]   which got into this and the data for this.
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:57.540]   If you've heard that having some alcohol,
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.740]   in particular red wine, is better for you than no alcohol,
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.540]   that is simply not true.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:02.980]   Sorry, it's not true.
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:04.740]   Most adults who are not alcoholics
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:07.900]   can probably have up to two, that's right,
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:11.500]   two drinks per week and still be on the safe side of health,
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.460]   although zero is better than two.
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:14.660]   And once you get past two,
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:16.860]   you start seeing effects on various systems,
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.260]   including increased cancer risk,
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:23.680]   especially brain neuron loss and degeneration risk.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:25.920]   I covered all of those data in the episode on alcohol
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.820]   that you can find at hubermanlab.com.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.720]   Combining alcohol with sympathomimetics,
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.040]   even though they reside in very different pathways
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.380]   within the brain, in fact,
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.080]   the sympathomimetics are driving up
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.320]   sympathetic nervous system activity,
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.320]   whereas alcohol is actually doing the opposite,
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.860]   it's depressing it, and yet all the data point to the fact
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:48.920]   that combining alcohol with sympathomimetics,
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.500]   such as Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin,
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:55.900]   or any kind of amphetamine is going to be more detrimental
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.940]   to the brain and body than simply taking those drugs
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:18:59.840]   on their own.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.800]   Put differently and more directly,
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.880]   if you are taking any of the drugs
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:06.400]   that we've been talking about to treat ADHD,
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:09.580]   or if you just happen to be taking them for whatever reason,
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:13.720]   you are going to want to avoid drinking alcohol at any time,
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:17.160]   and you're going to want to avoid benzodiazepines and similar
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.620]   unless they've been prescribed to you by your physician.
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:21.820]   In advance of this episode,
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.220]   I put a call out on social media for questions
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:26.420]   about Adderall, et cetera,
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.480]   and I got a lot of questions
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.900]   about whether or not there are impacts of these drugs
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.420]   on the hormone systems of the body,
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:37.020]   and if they impact the reproductive system in particular.
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.240]   I also got questions about whether or not these drugs
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:44.240]   impact sexual behavior or libido or anything of that sort.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.680]   In reviewing the literature,
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.920]   what I can tell you is that there are very few studies,
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.800]   unfortunately, of the long-term effects of these drugs
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.300]   on the endocrine or hormone systems of the body,
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.040]   but we do know a few things for sure.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.800]   First of all, when you increase the activity
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:01.520]   of the sympathetic nervous system for long periods of time,
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.840]   you are very likely increasing levels of cortisol.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.220]   Cortisol is a quote-unquote stress hormone,
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:09.420]   but cortisol also plays some really important
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.780]   positive roles in your body.
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:12.740]   In fact, if you want cortisol released,
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:14.440]   especially early in the day,
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.560]   you don't want cortisol released so much late in the day.
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.740]   This actually relates back to timing
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.080]   and schedules of taking drugs.
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.220]   This is something, again, that needs to be worked out
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:26.940]   with your psychiatrist or your child's psychiatrist.
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:29.840]   But one of the reasons why there are so many different drugs
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.040]   for the treatment of ADHD is that each and all of them
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.120]   has a different time course of action.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.440]   So Ritalin is very short-lived, which might sound bad
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.960]   because then you have to take it multiple times
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.020]   throughout the day.
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:42.220]   But if you think about from the perspective of sleep
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:45.000]   and the importance of having low cortisol at night
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.600]   and these drugs increase cortisol
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.760]   and the importance of getting sleep,
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.520]   because after all, sleep is the foundation
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.640]   of mental health, physical health,
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.480]   and performance in kids and adults.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.640]   It's responsible for growth.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.160]   It's when neuroplasticity happens.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.780]   It's just so vitally important.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:00.520]   A lot of the drugs that we've been talking about
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.680]   can severely limit one's ability to fall and stay asleep.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.760]   And so a short-acting drug like Ritalin
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.920]   is actually attractive from the perspective
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.800]   of being able to take it in the morning
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.040]   and still get to sleep at night,
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.080]   or taking it in the morning and in the afternoon,
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.600]   and maybe even again in the evening,
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.440]   depending on the person,
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.400]   and then still being able to fall asleep at night.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.720]   Whereas long duration release of D-amfetamine,
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.720]   which is what you get when you take Vyvanse,
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.940]   for some people is going to inhibit their sleep.
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:31.660]   They'll get a nice, steady rise and improvement in focus
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:33.000]   and reduction in hyperactivity,
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.220]   but they might have a lot of trouble
[01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:36.680]   falling asleep at night.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.940]   And Adderall, having a somewhat intermediate
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.440]   time course of action between Ritalin,
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.960]   which is short-lived, and Vyvanse, which is very long-lived,
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.100]   perhaps is going to be the best solution for somebody else,
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:48.400]   where they can take it early in the day,
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.880]   perhaps at a low dose, maybe again later in the day,
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.240]   low dose, and then still fall asleep at night.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.680]   But I've spoken to people,
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:58.200]   and I spoke to this clinician expert in ADHD
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.400]   who told me that some people will take
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:04.400]   as little as 2.5 milligrams of Adderall at 6 a.m.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.400]   and have a hard time falling asleep
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.220]   later that night at 11 p.m.
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.820]   So again, vastly different sensitivities to these drugs,
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.740]   leading to vastly different requirements
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.520]   of dosage and timing of intake
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:19.640]   and which particular drug somebody might choose to
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.400]   or choose not to take.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.160]   So how does that relate to hormones
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.580]   and sex and reproduction?
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:27.360]   Well, cortisol itself is a hormone.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.500]   It can act as a bit of a hormone
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.200]   and a neurotransmitter in the brain,
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.560]   but for the most part,
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.600]   it's acting as a hormone in the brain and body,
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.060]   and it does a number of things.
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:40.260]   First of all, it can enhance your levels
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:41.680]   of focus and alertness.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.520]   It can activate your immune system.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:45.400]   I know the immunologists out there just cringe
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.000]   when I say activate the immune system.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.880]   Your immune system is always doing various things,
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.740]   so it's always active,
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:52.880]   just as your nervous system is always active,
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.760]   but it can, to be specific,
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:59.360]   it can amplify or mobilize the release
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:02.280]   of anti-inflammatory molecules in your brain and body
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.040]   to combat different types of bacterial,
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.680]   viral, and fungal infections.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.160]   It's doing an enormous number of positive things.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.240]   It's also involved in setting mood.
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.380]   It has interactions with thyroid hormone pathways.
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:15.420]   I've done entire episodes about cortisol
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.320]   and cortisol regulation.
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.620]   To paint all of that with a very broad brush
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.180]   and briefly now,
[01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.740]   it's advantageous to have your cortisol release high
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:26.100]   in the early part of the day
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:27.860]   and to taper off toward the end of the day.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:31.900]   In fact, late day elevations in cortisol
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:33.900]   are a strong correlate of depressive symptoms.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:35.420]   This was demonstrated by my colleagues,
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:37.300]   David Spiegel and Robert Sapolsky
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.620]   at Stanford School of Medicine,
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:42.060]   but that is not to say that cortisol is bad.
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:45.540]   It's to say that the timing of cortisol release is key.
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:49.660]   So do these sympathomimetic drugs
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:51.180]   disrupt the endocrine system?
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:52.060]   Well, they can.
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.060]   If you are very awake and very alert,
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:55.200]   regardless of whether or not
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.040]   you're taking your sympathomimetic treatment for ADHD
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.940]   early in the day or late in the day,
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:03.100]   you are very likely experiencing elevations in cortisol
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.200]   late in the day.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.600]   So it is important,
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.600]   even for those of you that like to study
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:10.340]   and need to focus in the evening and nighttime hours,
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:13.260]   that you try and limit your levels of overall alertness
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.560]   and certainly stress late in the day,
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.060]   because doing that day after day after day
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.060]   for several weeks or months or years
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:22.940]   can indeed disrupt other hormones in the endocrine system.
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.380]   And again, that's because cortisol
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.940]   is interacting with thyroid hormone
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:27.780]   and testosterone and estrogen.
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:32.700]   In fact, cortisol in many ways competes with
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:36.540]   or can out-compete for the production of testosterone
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.580]   and other so-called steroid hormones.
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:42.940]   Remember, cortisol itself is a corticosteroid hormone.
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.200]   So when we hear the word steroids,
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.880]   oftentimes people just think about athletes
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.440]   and steroid abuse in sports,
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.980]   but steroid hormones includes
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:51.180]   a lot of different types of hormones which are good for us.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.420]   Our endogenous steroid hormones are vital
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:56.780]   for all sorts of things, vitality, reproduction, et cetera.
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:00.060]   And the way this works in general terms
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.900]   is that the cholesterol molecule
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:06.900]   is used to create testosterone and cortisol and estrogen.
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.960]   If we make too much cortisol,
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.380]   we in many ways are reducing
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:14.460]   the total amount of testosterone that we make
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:15.460]   or that is active.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:18.300]   It's not exactly that straightforward,
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:21.940]   but we can make that statement with confidence.
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.780]   For instance, if you spike your cortisol
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:25.900]   just briefly during the day
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.680]   'cause you have some sort of stressful event,
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:29.580]   that's not going to inhibit your testosterone.
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:31.100]   In fact, it probably is going to boost
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:32.860]   your testosterone levels somewhat.
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:36.080]   However, if your cortisol levels are chronically elevated,
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.960]   yes, indeed, it's likely that you're going to suppress
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.460]   your total and/or free unbound forms of testosterone.
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:46.160]   And downstream to that, you will experience effects
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.640]   such as reductions in libido,
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.860]   reductions in muscle and bone mass,
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:52.720]   reductions in all sorts of aspects
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:57.120]   of testosterone-related psychology and bodily biology.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.880]   This is true for both males and females.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.160]   And the same thing could be said for estrogen.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.580]   Now, what's impossible for us to say
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:05.280]   is whether or not taking a given treatment for ADHD
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:08.080]   is going to, for instance, prevent a woman from ovulating.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.360]   That could happen through chronic elevations in cortisol,
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.180]   but there's no direct link,
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:15.680]   meaning there are no studies, at least that I'm aware of,
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.580]   showing that people that take Adderall
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:20.740]   have irregular ovulatory cycles
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.860]   or that they cease menstruating entirely.
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:24.960]   I don't think there's any evidence for that whatsoever,
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:27.540]   nor is there any evidence that people that take Adderall
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:30.340]   or other sympathomimetics for the treatment of ADHD
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.780]   have lower overall testosterone.
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.540]   In fact, you can imagine all sorts of instances
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:36.320]   in which the opposite was true,
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:40.240]   that a child or young adult or adult who has ADHD
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:43.400]   but then goes on these meds to improve their symptoms
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.400]   is now focusing and achieving more in life.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.960]   We know that happiness can impact dopamine and vice versa
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.080]   and testosterone levels and productivity itself
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.740]   and reaching our goals can feed back on the hormone system.
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:57.240]   So anytime there's a discussion about hormones
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:00.560]   or a study that shows that doing X or not doing Y
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.720]   impacts hormone levels of a given type,
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.160]   we have to be very careful to make sure
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.840]   that we're talking about causality
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.180]   because all of these hormones
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:11.640]   are in a very intricate crosstalk with one another.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.020]   We can, however, make a very general statement,
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:17.140]   which is that when you are in states of stress
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:18.700]   for long periods of time,
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.420]   that is not a favorable condition for your immune system,
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:24.360]   your hormone system, or frankly,
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.560]   any other system in the brain and body.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.960]   So the treatment of ADHD with these drugs
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.640]   should never be done at the expense
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.320]   of these other critical biological systems.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:37.160]   Another common question and concern is whether or not kids,
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.360]   and I suppose for that matter,
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:41.920]   adults that take medication for ADHD
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:45.520]   are basically being predisposed to psychosis
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.600]   and/or other forms of addiction.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.380]   And earlier we talked a bit about the risk for addiction
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.400]   and the take-home message there is very clear
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:57.360]   that kids and adults that are treated for ADHD appropriately,
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.240]   so with the appropriate dosage of the appropriate drugs
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.400]   under the supervision of a board-certified
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:05.480]   qualified psychiatrist, are at less risk
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.480]   for forming addictions to other substances in adulthood
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.040]   or other substances generally.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.080]   I think a lot of people also wonder whether or not
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.800]   those kids and those adults that take these ADHD meds
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.760]   become addicted to the medications themselves.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.400]   That's a bit of a tricky issue to resolve.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.200]   Anytime one stops taking a drug or even tapers off a drug
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:31.160]   that's used to treat something where they feel better
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.720]   on the drug, they're going to experience two sets of effects
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:37.020]   and these two sets of effects are often confounded
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:37.860]   with one another.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:40.120]   One is the withdrawal effects,
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.880]   so the effects of removing the drug
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:44.840]   that makes somebody feel less good than baseline.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.620]   So for instance, a kid that takes ADHD meds
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:50.660]   until their late teens or early 20s
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.520]   decides they're going to taper off, they do that,
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.860]   and they're feeling lousy during the taper
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:57.880]   or when they reduce their dosage to zero,
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:02.020]   they're foggy brain, they can't focus,
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:04.480]   they feel a little bit depressed mood.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:08.000]   It's unclear whether or not those are withdrawal symptoms
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.940]   or whether or not those are the consequence
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:13.520]   of not having the systems in their brain activated
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:16.080]   the way that those systems were activated before.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.080]   I realize that for some of you
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.560]   that might seem like the same thing,
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.400]   but that's not necessarily the same thing.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.680]   And probably the best analogy would be
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.180]   something along the lines of a hangover, right?
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.720]   If somebody drinks too much on a given night,
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.400]   the next morning they have a hangover,
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.640]   the hangover makes them feel lousy.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:34.560]   It is actually a withdrawal from alcohol effect.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:37.340]   But then when they recover from the hangover,
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:40.720]   they realize that their sober state feels pretty good.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.400]   It doesn't obviously feel the same as being on alcohol,
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:47.480]   but that sober state is not a state of withdrawal, okay?
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.760]   If we were to look at removal
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.280]   or tapering off of ADHD meds,
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.880]   there's going to be a period of withdrawal symptoms,
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.120]   but then the real question is how does somebody feel
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:59.240]   after they get through those withdrawal symptoms?
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:01.120]   So that's an important issue to highlight.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.360]   Now, in terms of psychosis,
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.280]   this is a very interesting and very important literature.
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:07.520]   First of all, any amphetamine,
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.960]   whether or not it's D-amphetamine, L-amphetamine,
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.960]   and also methylphenidate for that matter,
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.300]   Ritalin, can induce psychosis.
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:17.240]   Now, there are a number of different factors
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:20.080]   that are going to predispose somebody to psychosis.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:22.640]   Having a first relative who's had psychotic episodes,
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:25.840]   either schizophrenic episodes or bipolar episodes
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:29.280]   is certainly a strong predisposition.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.920]   Of course, if an individual themselves
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.220]   have had psychotic episodes,
[01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:37.160]   that's the strongest predisposition that one can imagine.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.760]   So having a first relative with schizophrenia
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.680]   or with bipolar depression,
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.320]   or it's sometimes called bipolar disorder,
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:46.840]   sometimes it's also just called bipolar these days,
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:49.500]   is going to be a strong predisposition
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:53.440]   for psychotic episodes made much greater
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.940]   anytime one takes a sympathomimetic drug,
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:59.240]   such as amphetamine, but also methylphenidate, Ritalin,
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:03.320]   is going to increase that likelihood of psychotic episodes.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.660]   Then comes the question of,
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:06.520]   if somebody has a psychotic episode
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:09.920]   as the consequence of taking any of these drugs,
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:12.780]   whether or not it's been prescribed for ADHD or not,
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:15.080]   will those psychotic symptoms go away
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.520]   after the person stops taking the drug?
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.840]   There appears to be a divide in the literature,
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:22.120]   or rather a divide according to drug,
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.840]   such that people that take Ritalin, methylphenidate,
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.880]   and have a psychotic episode, often, not always,
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:32.160]   but most often if they stop taking methylphenidate,
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.920]   the psychotic episode will cease.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.800]   Not always the case, but most often times it will cease.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:42.100]   Whereas in individuals who have a predisposition to psychosis
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.240]   or even if they're not aware
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:46.640]   of a predisposition to psychosis and they take Adderall,
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:50.520]   which as you recall is a combination of D and L-amphetamine,
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.580]   they can have psychotic episodes
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:54.560]   that sometimes are very long lasting
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:57.160]   even after the cessation of the drug.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.480]   And while that might sound kind of shocking
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.680]   and really scary, and indeed it is scary,
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:04.820]   it perhaps shouldn't shock us that much
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:07.360]   because if you recall, D-amphetamine,
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.980]   which there's a lot of in Adderall,
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:13.320]   it's a very potent way of increasing dopamine.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.840]   And anytime you potently increase dopamine
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:19.480]   in a person who has a predisposition to psychotic episodes,
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.300]   you are shifting the whole system
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:24.840]   toward a greater propensity for psychosis.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.220]   This would also be the appropriate time
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:29.120]   to talk about meth, methamphetamine.
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:32.360]   Again, methamphetamine is considered an illicit drug,
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.640]   a drug of abuse.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.960]   It is responsible for a lot of the misfortune
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:40.480]   and tragedy that you see on the streets of major cities
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.600]   and even outside of major cities and rural areas.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.640]   It has all sorts of negative effects on health,
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:49.960]   including oral health, cardiovascular health.
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:53.260]   It is neurotoxic to serotonergic neurons,
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:56.520]   so it kills serotonin neurons, that is absolutely clear.
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:00.460]   It kills dopaminergic neurons, that is absolutely clear.
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.760]   One of the ways that methamphetamine
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:04.200]   creates so many of the problems that it does,
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.040]   getting effects on the body,
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.760]   abuse potential, addictive potential,
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:12.440]   the fact that methamphetamine can spark psychosis
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.480]   in those that have a predisposition to psychosis,
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:17.000]   but also that it can create psychosis
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.920]   in individuals who have no predisposition to psychosis.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.440]   All of this points to methamphetamine
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:25.120]   just being a terrible drug all around.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.300]   And yet, if you recall back to the beginning of the episode,
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:30.460]   there is one form of prescription methamphetamine,
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:33.080]   but its uses are extremely narrow,
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.020]   and it's probably best left out of this conversation
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:39.880]   because its uses are so, so narrow in the clinical sense.
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.360]   I managed to talk to one expert.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.980]   This is a board-certified psychiatrist
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:46.280]   who's expert in ADHD, who is also very familiar
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.840]   with the psychosis symptoms induced by methamphetamine
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:53.060]   and by various ADHD drugs
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:55.060]   and people who have the predisposition.
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:57.780]   They made it very clear that any of the sympathomimetic
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:01.760]   ADHD drugs that are of the amphetamine variety,
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:06.480]   so that would be Adderall and extended-release Adderall,
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.340]   that would be pure Dexedrine,
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:11.160]   or any variants that include amphetamine
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.140]   are going to have higher likelihood of inducing psychosis
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:18.240]   in people that have a predisposition to psychosis.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.080]   And yet, they did assure me
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:24.260]   that at appropriately prescribed and safe dosages,
[01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:26.540]   that the total incidence of psychosis
[01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:30.020]   in people that take those drugs is still fairly low
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:33.240]   and not that much greater than in the general population,
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:37.000]   although there is an increased risk, it's not that severe.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.480]   And they also highlighted the fact
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:41.520]   that methylphenidate Ritalin carries a lower potential
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:44.560]   for inducing psychosis, not zero,
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.960]   but a lower level of inducing psychosis.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.780]   Then for the amphetamine-type sympathomimetics,
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:51.640]   now one exception is Vyvanse,
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:54.960]   that long-release d-amphetamine that we talked about earlier.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:56.920]   There does seem to be something protective
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.360]   about that long-duration release of d-amphetamine
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.080]   that occurs with Vyvanse,
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.880]   which is not to say that there's zero abuse
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:06.140]   or addictive potential with Vyvanse.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.080]   I was told by this same individual
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.880]   that indeed they've had knowledge of patients
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:16.280]   trying to increase the rate of absorption of Vyvanse
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.880]   and release of Vyvanse, or technically of the d-amphetamine,
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.560]   in order to get more of a high from Vyvanse
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.580]   as opposed to just the extended release.
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:26.200]   But they did assure me, however,
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:27.600]   that Vyvanse seems to be associated
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.040]   with fewer psychotic episodes
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.920]   and less abuse and addictive potential overall,
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:34.860]   which again is not to say that it's a perfectly safe drug,
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:36.480]   but really this just highlights the fact
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:38.840]   that the kinetics or the time course
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.640]   of dopamine and norepinephrine release
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.200]   that's caused by a given drug
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.920]   is going to correlate very strongly
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:46.280]   with its abuse potential and addictive potential
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.720]   and its potential to induce psychotic episodes.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.400]   And this is where the discussion about meth
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.840]   becomes especially relevant.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:54.220]   One of the reasons why meth is so dangerous
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:56.400]   in terms of its addictive potential
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.920]   and its potential to induce psychotic episodes
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.160]   is first of all, how much dopamine it releases,
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.240]   again, five times more than any of the other drugs
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.260]   that we've been talking about,
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:08.080]   but also how fast that peak comes on.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.660]   It's a very fast onset.
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:11.680]   And that's true whether or not people are snorting it,
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.880]   whether or not they're taking it orally,
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.760]   or especially if they inject it intravenously.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:19.600]   But meth, because it increases dopamine so fast
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.000]   and to such a great degree,
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.440]   and then the peak in dopamine comes down very fast as well,
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:28.600]   and it drops below the baseline levels of dopamine
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.120]   that were present initially,
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.920]   that's one of the reasons why methamphetamine
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.960]   is so dangerous in terms of addiction
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:36.020]   and in terms of psychotic episodes.
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:38.120]   Now, this gets back to a bunch of issues
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.300]   we've talked about before on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:41.700]   about dopamine kinetics.
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:43.360]   And I've done two episodes on dopamine
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.200]   that I'll refer you to.
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.020]   One is called "Dopamine Motivation and Drive,"
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:48.420]   which is all about dopamine and regulating dopamine.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:50.920]   And the other one is about optimizing dopamine.
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.700]   It's more of a toolkit focused episode,
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:54.680]   both of those you can find at HubermanLab.com.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.700]   But the general takeaway that's relevant
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:59.180]   for what we're talking about now is that with dopamine,
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:01.740]   it's not just about the absolute levels of dopamine
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:04.240]   that are reached, but how long lasting
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.380]   those increases in dopamine are.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:11.220]   So with Vyvanse, even though Vyvanse is D-amphetamine,
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:14.020]   it's fairly potent, not as potent as meth,
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:17.760]   but fairly potent at increasing dopamine and norepinephrine,
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.340]   it's a long extended release in dopamine and norepinephrine,
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:23.660]   which reduces its overall abuse potential
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:26.780]   because it doesn't tend to create that immediate euphoria
[01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:29.980]   and high and then crash below baseline.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:33.300]   A lot of you will hear that it increases dopamine a lot
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:36.440]   and then stays up as translating to,
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.940]   okay, well then you're just euphoric for 16 hours,
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:40.180]   but that's not the case.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:41.820]   When it comes to dopamine,
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:44.540]   it's an issue of how high that peak is
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.220]   and whether or not that peak is stable
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:48.100]   or whether or not it comes down again.
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:50.300]   And when it comes to psychotic episodes
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:54.080]   or addictive potential, it seems that any drug or behavior
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:55.920]   that increases dopamine very quickly
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.340]   and then brings dopamine down very quickly
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.980]   is what sets the high potential for addiction and abuse
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:04.860]   and for inducing psychotic episodes.
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:07.720]   So that's why I'm talking about these two things in parallel.
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.960]   And now it should be very clear why Vyvanse
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.620]   doesn't have so much addictive and abuse potential
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:16.060]   and has at least lower potential
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:17.580]   for inducing psychotic episodes.
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:19.300]   And it should also be clear to you
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:25.360]   that for people who do not have ADHD as a child
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:29.660]   or for people that do not have ADHD in adulthood,
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:33.080]   if they were to take any, truly any of the compounds
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.220]   that we're talking about thus far,
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:39.080]   methylphenidate, Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse,
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.780]   Dexedrine, and certainly methamphetamine,
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:44.000]   what we observe from neuroimaging studies
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.800]   is that these people get enormous increases in dopamine.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.220]   They're not familiar with these drugs,
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:53.060]   so the increases in dopamine are just cosmic for them.
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.420]   They experience a lot of euphoria.
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:56.940]   Even if the dosages are low,
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:58.460]   the euphoria is associated
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:00.700]   with a very heightened degree of focus
[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:02.020]   they've never really felt before.
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.560]   Here, what I'm talking about is a lot of the recreational
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:08.060]   and off-prescription use of Adderall and things like it.
[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:11.660]   And what we know is that that sets in motion
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:14.860]   both a potential for abuse and addiction
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:17.200]   to that feeling and substance,
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.420]   as well as a higher potential
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:22.120]   for psychotic episodes down the road, okay?
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.520]   So put differently, children who have ADHD
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.520]   and are prescribed any of these drugs,
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:31.000]   or adults who have ADHD
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.640]   and are prescribed any of these drugs,
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.820]   who take them for some period of time,
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:39.240]   are actually at lesser risk to all of the issues
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.860]   related to having chronically elevated
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:43.920]   and greatly elevated dopamine
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:46.920]   as a kind of first-time event or as a rare event,
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:50.760]   whereas anyone who takes these drugs without a prescription
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.660]   and decides, okay, I want to focus more,
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:55.460]   or I'm going to use this to stay up for a couple of days,
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:57.740]   in other words, using it recreationally
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:40:00.460]   or using it for, quote unquote, performance enhancement,
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:04.260]   is at far greater risk for addiction to these substances
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:08.220]   because of the amplitude and the time course of dopamine
[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:10.220]   that results when one takes these drugs
[01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:11.860]   just out of the blue.
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:13.360]   And so for that reason,
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.440]   I really want to caution everybody
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.500]   against using any of the compounds
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:19.260]   that I've discussed thus far,
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:21.820]   unless it's been prescribed to you by a physician
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:25.100]   for the specific purpose of ADHD.
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:27.420]   Now I'm sure someone out there is screaming from the back,
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:30.520]   wait, if a kid takes these drugs
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.720]   because they're prescribed them for ADHD
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:34.140]   the very first time they take them,
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:37.940]   they're going to have a huge amplitude dopamine response.
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:41.640]   Or if an adult goes in and talks to their psychiatrist
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:43.740]   and says, you know, I'm having issues with focusing
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:46.060]   and they're prescribed one of these meds for ADHD
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:46.900]   and they take it,
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:49.460]   they're going to have a huge amplitude dopamine response.
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:52.020]   Isn't that going to set in motion all the same things
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:54.740]   that somebody who is using these drugs recreationally
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:55.580]   would have?
[01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:57.740]   And indeed, that's one of the reasons
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:01.220]   why a lot of psychiatrists will start with a very low dosage
[01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:03.460]   or the lowest possible dosage
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:06.540]   to see how somebody responds to that low dosage.
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:10.140]   And then over time might or might not increase that dosage.
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:11.860]   In fact, they might even bring it down further
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:14.260]   depending on how sensitive somebody is to the drug.
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:17.420]   But equally important is the fact that
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:20.340]   it is the repeated taking of that drug
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:23.820]   by the child with ADHD or by the adult with ADHD
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:27.080]   that actually leads to lesser and lesser peaks
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.740]   in dopamine each time,
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:30.580]   which is not to say that the person
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.740]   becomes entirely desensitized to the effects of the drug,
[01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:35.920]   but rather that the system equilibrates
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:37.900]   through what's called homeostatic plasticity.
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:41.300]   It's sometimes referred to broadly as habituation to a drug,
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:43.980]   but there are systems in the brain and body
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:46.340]   that regulate the connections between neurons
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:48.500]   so that if dopamine and norepinephrine
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:52.080]   are elevated above baseline levels for a while,
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.800]   the system normalizes so that instead
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.420]   the connections between neurons become stronger
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:00.440]   and there isn't the critical requirement
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.040]   for all that increase in dopamine and norepinephrine.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.680]   I realize that might sound a little bit technical,
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.060]   but basically what I'm saying is
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.360]   the response that somebody has to taking a drug
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:11.560]   for the first time is far and away different
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.060]   than the response to a drug that somebody has
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:18.020]   if they are taking the same drug day after day after day.
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:19.260]   This gets to another issue,
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:21.600]   which is not discussed that often these days,
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.840]   but that is really important.
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.760]   If you go back to the original clinical literature
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.800]   on these sympathomimetics,
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:30.000]   what you'll find is that the original use
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.980]   of these sympathomimetics to treat childhood ADHD
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:36.400]   suggested that children not take these drugs
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.440]   every single day.
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:40.640]   Now, I'm not recommending that kids take drug holidays
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:41.960]   because I'm not a clinician,
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.200]   I'm not promoting any specific dose or dosing regimen,
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:50.600]   but in speaking again to a psychiatrist expert in ADHD,
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.680]   who by the way is going to be a guest on this podcast
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.560]   in the not too distant future,
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.880]   what he told me was that many of these drugs
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:59.440]   were designed to be taken during the school week
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.900]   for children with weekends off
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.300]   or during the school year with weekends off,
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:07.640]   but then also with vacations during the summer holidays.
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:10.480]   And that these days rarely, if ever,
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.920]   is that the pattern of intake that these kids are following.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:18.160]   And why that is has interesting sociological
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:20.640]   and financial explanations.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.620]   I'm not alluding to any kind of conspiracy here,
[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:25.880]   but this is an aspect of the dosing with these drugs
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:28.720]   that has fallen away in recent years,
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.040]   but I think is really interesting.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.480]   And it's something that actually was supported
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:35.200]   for the treatment of adult ADHD as well.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.520]   Again, there is a very different biological
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:43.000]   and neuroplastic response to taking a drug once
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.040]   versus taking a drug for say five days
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:47.280]   and then taking weekends off
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:51.080]   to taking a drug over and over again every single day
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.540]   for a pattern of years.
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:54.600]   And when exploring the literature
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.320]   in preparation for this episode,
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:59.120]   I confess it was a bit dizzying to find answers
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.540]   to what are the long-term effects of taking Adderall
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:02.780]   or what are the long-term effects
[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:04.700]   of taking Vyvanse, et cetera.
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:07.380]   In fact, most of the literature on the long-term effects
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:09.700]   of taking drugs to treat ADHD
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:11.840]   has focused on methylphenidate on Ritalin.
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.060]   There are studies on Vyvanse and Adderall,
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:15.980]   and actually those were the studies
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:19.760]   that I will link in the show note captions primarily,
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.140]   'cause that's where most of the interest is these days.
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:26.200]   The reason why so many of the studies have focused
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:29.000]   on methylphenidate on Ritalin is largely
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.060]   because that was one of the first drugs used to treat ADHD.
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:34.860]   So in terms of addressing long-term effects
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:37.260]   of kids treated with ADHD meds,
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:39.480]   those kids are now adults
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:42.040]   and therefore can be neuroimaged and assessed.
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.640]   Whereas a lot of kids that have been prescribed Adderall
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:48.720]   or Vyvanse or similar have not yet made it to stages of life
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.500]   in which we can answer that question directly.
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:52.880]   There are a few studies and I've made it clear
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:55.680]   to include those studies in my description of results today.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:58.120]   In particular, the results I talked about earlier
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:01.840]   where there's an improvement in executive function
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.320]   in kids that have taken ADHD meds
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:06.520]   or adults that have taken ADHD meds
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:10.460]   for a longer period of time, anywhere from months to years,
[01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:13.740]   those studies did include both Adderall and Vyvanse
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:16.480]   and methylphenidate, and again, I'll link to those studies.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:18.000]   But by and large, most of what we know
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.480]   about the long-term effects of any of these drugs
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:23.880]   has to do primarily with studies of methylphenidate.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.320]   I'd like to spend a little bit of time
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.880]   talking about some compounds
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:30.360]   that are not considered amphetamines at all,
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:33.160]   but that are now being used to treat ADHD
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.000]   both in children and adults more frequently.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.520]   The major drug in this category
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:41.980]   of non-amphetamine treatments for ADHD is modafinil,
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:45.940]   which is also called by its commercial name, Provagil.
[01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:48.280]   There's a variant on this, which is armodafinil,
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.380]   which goes by the brand name Nuvagil.
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:54.480]   The major difference between modafinil and armodafinil,
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.040]   aside from having a slight chemical difference,
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.940]   is that modafinil was released first,
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:03.620]   armodafinil is the second in the generation of these drugs,
[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:06.860]   and modafinil tends to be very expensive.
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:07.800]   That's one of the reasons
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:09.380]   why it's prohibitive for some people to take.
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:12.240]   It can be as expensive as $25 a pill or more,
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:14.720]   so more than $1,000 per month.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:18.940]   And armodafinil tends to be far, far less expensive.
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:20.220]   I've talked to a couple experts
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:22.680]   about whether or not there are any genuine differences
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:26.920]   between these two drugs, and they report no,
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:30.600]   although consumers of these drugs, for whatever reason,
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.660]   whether or not it's placebo or not,
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:34.400]   report yes, there is a difference.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.800]   When I say placebo, I in no way mean
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.600]   that these drugs are just acting as placebo,
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:41.480]   I just mean that people tend to get very attached
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:43.760]   to certain drugs and whether or not the brand name
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:45.880]   or the generic version works better for them.
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:48.180]   There's all sorts of lore about this.
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:50.720]   In fact, there are a lot of people out there
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.620]   who strongly feel that brand name Adderall
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:58.880]   works better than generic Adderall for them.
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:46:59.960]   There are a lot of people out there
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.640]   who say the same thing about Vyvanse.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:02.480]   There are a lot of people out there
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.500]   who say the same thing about Ritalin and all sorts of drugs.
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:07.720]   Whether or not that's true or not is unclear.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:11.880]   It is clear that generic versions of drugs can use binders
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:14.820]   and other things that are in the pill or capsule
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:17.220]   that are different than what the brand name pillar capsule
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:19.280]   uses as binders to hold the drug together,
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:22.940]   and that can impact rates of release and metabolism, et cetera.
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:24.640]   But a lot of this is just lore.
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:26.040]   In fact, I went into the literature
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:29.420]   to try and find any real concrete support
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:33.280]   for the idea that generic Adderall is less potent
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:35.720]   or less effective than brand name Adderall.
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:38.260]   And despite the tens of thousands of people
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:40.520]   who will say to the contrary,
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:43.840]   I could not find any peer-reviewed published data about that.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:44.680]   So who knows?
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:46.880]   Maybe it's a belief effect as it's called.
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.600]   Maybe there's a real difference there.
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:50.440]   Nowadays, modafinil and armodafinil
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.920]   are prescribed for a huge range
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:55.080]   of daytime sleepiness issues.
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.940]   And we were talking about narcolepsy,
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.300]   but there are also people who suffer
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:02.260]   from daytime sleepiness related to dementia,
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:06.780]   daytime sleepiness related to post-surgery anesthesia.
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:09.420]   So there's this thing where people have surgery
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:11.100]   and then they come out of surgery
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:12.580]   and they feel better for a few days,
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:14.240]   but then they find that they aren't recovering
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.820]   their normal levels of wakefulness.
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:17.900]   So it's prescribed sometimes to try and get people back
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:19.880]   into a normal state of wakefulness.
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:23.180]   It's been prescribed for traumatic head injury after stroke.
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:25.660]   Again, all of these prescribed uses
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:29.120]   have to be carried out by a certified physician.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.520]   You really don't want to start cowboying
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:33.420]   the use of modafinil or armodafinil
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:36.360]   or any other prescription drug for that matter.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.660]   I must say that in discussing all these different drugs
[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:40.160]   during today's episode,
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:43.940]   I have zero knowledge of any of these drugs
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.120]   from a firsthand experience, except for armodafinil.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:50.820]   Back in 2017, I was prescribed a very, very low dose
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:53.260]   of armodafinil for jet lag,
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:55.540]   for daytime sleepiness issues, really,
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:48:58.100]   when I was traveling overseas to give a talk.
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:02.960]   So armodafinil was given to me in a 25 milligram tablet.
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:06.120]   It was advised to me that I take a half
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:07.140]   or even a quarter of that.
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.620]   So I started with a quarter.
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:11.140]   I am a believer in minimal effective dose.
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.900]   I'm also somebody who's fairly hypersensitive
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:14.980]   to most medication.
[01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:19.480]   So I took what I measured out to be five to seven milligrams
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:23.960]   of armodafinil, and what I experienced was pretty profound.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.860]   Certainly it relieved any daytime sleepiness.
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:29.400]   In fact, it made me feel extremely alert
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:32.020]   for a period of about four to six hours.
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:34.440]   I can't say it was the most comfortable state,
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:37.340]   although I did not feel as if I had a racing heart
[01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:38.480]   or anything of that sort.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.900]   I basically felt as if I was in a narrow tunnel of attention
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.920]   for that entire period.
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:46.020]   One thing I did not like about the experience
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:49.020]   is that it was a very hard experience to come down from.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:52.500]   There was no crash, but I found that that high arousal state
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:54.900]   didn't taper off for many hours later.
[01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:57.340]   Even though it was most heightened for four hours,
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:59.620]   I would say anywhere from eight to 12 hours later,
[01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:01.820]   I still felt like I was blinking once
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:03.020]   every four minutes or so.
[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:05.280]   And I've certainly been accused on this podcast
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:07.980]   and at other times of blinking too seldom.
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.180]   To my knowledge, I don't have ADHD.
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:12.120]   I've never been prescribed ADHD meds.
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:14.760]   I've never been tested for ADHD.
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:16.220]   I don't think I have ADHD.
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:20.480]   And yet taking R-modafinil certainly increased my levels
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:23.780]   of attention, but at least by that one experience,
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:25.900]   it's not something that I would want to repeat again.
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:28.160]   I certainly would not want to be in that state
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.300]   for learning new material.
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:31.120]   When I sit down to research a podcast
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.340]   or research papers in my lab or forage for information
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:37.560]   or learn from people or books or lectures or podcasts,
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:40.180]   I want to be in a state of alertness but calm
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:41.940]   where I can really consider the ideas,
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:43.580]   where I can script things out by hand.
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:45.180]   I'm a big believer in writing things out by hand
[01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:47.500]   to remember them later, drawing little diagrams.
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.460]   I would not want to be in the state
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:52.900]   that even that very low dose of R-modafinil put me in
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:54.020]   in order to learn.
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:56.540]   And I should mention that both modafinil and R-modafinil
[01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:59.540]   are associated with a good number of side effects
[01:50:59.540 --> 01:51:02.340]   if they don't agree with you or if the dosage is too high.
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:03.920]   Things like decreased appetite,
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.300]   people can get a runny nose, headache.
[01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:09.460]   There's this instance of skin rashes.
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:13.100]   In fact, one of the reasons why modafinil and R-modafinil
[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:14.540]   aren't more broadly prescribed
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:17.340]   is that there's a very rare skin condition
[01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:20.820]   in which people who have taken certain drugs,
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:23.260]   not just modafinil or R-modafinil,
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:27.100]   have developed these very severe burn-type blisters.
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:28.980]   And in some cases, this can be fatal.
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:30.900]   This is, again, very rare.
[01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:34.120]   And it was observed in at least one patient
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:37.020]   who took modafinil as part of a trial
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:38.880]   for modafinil as a treatment for ADHD.
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:40.540]   It's called Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:44.060]   Please, if you are squeamish to images of skin abrasions
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:45.900]   and lesions and things of that sort,
[01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:47.420]   please don't look it up on the internet
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:50.460]   unless you're able to handle that and maybe not at all.
[01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:54.440]   But the point here is that one of the reasons
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.060]   that modafinil and R-modafinil
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:58.360]   are not more widely prescribed for ADHD
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.620]   and that it's still only prescribed off-label
[01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:04.280]   is that Stevens-Johnson syndrome
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:07.180]   was flagged as kind of a potential risk,
[01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:11.300]   although the ADHD specialists that I spoke to
[01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:12.840]   are somewhat frustrated with that
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:16.620]   because they insist that the frequency of this syndrome
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:19.160]   that causes the skin rash that's sometimes fatal
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:21.480]   is no more frequent in those that took modafinil
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:24.540]   in this trial than with other drugs that have been approved.
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:26.420]   So this gets into all sorts of issues
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:29.180]   around what drugs make it to approval and which ones don't.
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.580]   And as we know, modafinil and R-modafinil
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:33.280]   are already being prescribed
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.420]   in the general population for other things.
[01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:37.620]   This was dealing specifically with the question
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:40.840]   of whether or not it should be prescribed in kids with ADHD.
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:45.840]   And certainly I am a proponent of exerting extreme caution
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:48.740]   when thinking about which drugs should be approved
[01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:51.540]   for the treatment of anybody, but especially kids.
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:54.880]   And to round out our discussion of drugs
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:58.020]   used for the treatment of ADHD that fall into,
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:00.100]   let's call it the atypical category, right?
[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:03.040]   The typical category being Adderall, Vyvanse,
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:06.220]   methylphenidate, and things of that variety.
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:09.940]   The less typical would be modafinil, R-modafinil,
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:13.020]   purpirin, wellbutrin, and so forth.
[01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:17.440]   The last in this category of atypical is guanfacine.
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:19.700]   Guanfacine is an interesting compound.
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:22.560]   It's a compound that was developed to lower blood pressure,
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:24.620]   and indeed it does lower blood pressure.
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:28.160]   And it is an alpha-2A agonist,
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:33.160]   alpha-2A being a receptor for norepinephrine.
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:37.660]   So guanfacine is a non-stimulant medication to treat ADHD,
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:40.540]   and it's also used to treat some other conditions as well
[01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:44.560]   that is only working on the noradrenergic system.
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:47.220]   It is not tapping into the dopamine system.
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:49.500]   But all the other stuff that we talked about
[01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:53.860]   is really ramping up dopamine and norepinephrine.
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:56.180]   Guanfacine is only increasing norepinephrine,
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:54:00.700]   and it's doing so by what we say agonizing or stimulating
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:03.180]   one particular aspect of the noradrenergic system,
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:04.940]   and that's the alpha-2A system.
[01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:08.060]   What's interesting about guanfacine
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:10.860]   is that it has a bunch of pathways that it activates
[01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:14.980]   that feed back onto the autonomic nervous system
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:17.900]   to dampen down the activation
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.300]   of the sympathetic nervous system.
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:21.340]   So whereas most of what we talked about today
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:24.300]   are sympathomimetics, they tend to make us more ramped up,
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:26.100]   more aroused and alert.
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:27.620]   Guanfacine is doing the opposite.
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:30.940]   And as a consequence, it's not prescribed that often
[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:33.340]   because a lot of times when people take guanfacine,
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:36.620]   it either has no effect on ADHD symptoms,
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.740]   or it tends to make people feel very sleepy.
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:41.500]   However, there's a small subset of individuals,
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:44.280]   probably about 5% to 10% of people that try it,
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:48.260]   including kids, that do get some significant relief
[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:50.180]   from their ADHD symptoms,
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:52.420]   and they seem to tolerate guanfacine better
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:54.100]   than they're tolerating some of the other drugs
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.900]   that we've talked about up until now.
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:58.880]   The way guanfacine works is also really interesting.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:00.760]   You're now familiar with the locus coeruleus,
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:04.060]   this packet, or we call it a nucleus of neurons
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:05.940]   in the back of the brain that release norepinephrine
[01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:07.140]   at other sites in the brain.
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:10.140]   And they're going to be those alpha 2A receptors
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:13.020]   that guanfacine works on and stimulates
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:14.600]   lots of different places in the brain
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.560]   related to increasing salience
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:19.740]   and relevance of particular stimuli that we see
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:21.400]   and that we need to attend to.
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.360]   It appears that guanfacine can activate
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:27.060]   the prefrontal cortical networks
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:29.760]   in ways that are above their normal baseline.
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.600]   So that's good.
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.000]   So improvements in executive function,
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.620]   that orchestra or teacher-like function
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:34.960]   we talked about before,
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:38.260]   and can increase the efficacy of that output
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:39.900]   from locus coeruleus.
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:43.620]   And what that seems to do is increase the coordinated firing
[01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:46.120]   of locus coeruleus neurons with prefrontal cortex.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:49.080]   So in many ways, it's acting like a fine tuning
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:51.740]   of that orchestra conductor operation
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:55.040]   that is so valuable in teaching these brain circuits
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:57.300]   during childhood of how to attend to one thing
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:58.980]   and ignore everything else.
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:01.420]   So this is one reason why guanfacine is now approved
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:02.940]   not just for adults with ADHD,
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:07.940]   but is primarily used in kids aged six to 17 years old
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:09.980]   for the treatment of ADHD.
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:12.880]   Again, with the hope that these kids can take the drug
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:15.160]   and these circuits can learn how to focus
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:17.860]   and how to attend to certain things
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:20.700]   and limit impulsivity and hyperactivity,
[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:22.440]   and then perhaps come off the drugs.
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:23.520]   Although sometimes, again,
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:26.200]   people have to stay on them indefinitely.
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:27.280]   The other thing about guanfacine
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.340]   is that because it lowers blood pressure
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.680]   and it has this effect of kind of dampening down
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:33.300]   overall sympathetic arousal,
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:35.660]   sometimes it is prescribed in conjunction
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:37.300]   with other ADHD meds.
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:39.860]   So yes, there are kids out there and adults out there
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:42.620]   who are taking Adderall and guanfacine,
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:44.540]   or they're taking Vyvanse and guanfacine,
[01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:47.220]   and this is where it starts to get into drug cocktails
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:49.980]   and a bunch of other things that gets everybody
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:51.460]   a little bit uncomfortable, I think,
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:53.220]   because the idea of taking one drug
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:55.140]   to dampen down the side effects of another drug
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:57.780]   and to offset things and compensate
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:00.940]   is getting towards what's called polypharmacology.
[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:02.880]   And I think it's understandable
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:04.220]   that people be concerned about that.
[01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:06.840]   And yet, again, in viewing this
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.820]   with some of the experts on ADHD,
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:11.100]   there do seem to be a certain category
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:12.340]   of children out there and adults
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:15.640]   who really struggle with the standard ADHD meds.
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:18.260]   And in that case, guanfacine has provided
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:21.080]   a certain number of these individuals tremendous relief.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:24.100]   One note about guanfacine, in no way, shape, or form,
[01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:25.140]   am I encouraging anyone
[01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:27.500]   who's not prescribed guanfacine to take it,
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:29.000]   but should you know someone
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.740]   who's taking guanfacine off-label
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:32.580]   in order to improve their focus
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:37.180]   or enhance any aspect of their biology or psychology,
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:39.400]   please let them know that it has a profound effect
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:41.140]   on lowering the tolerance for alcohol,
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:43.580]   such that even small amounts of alcohol
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:45.460]   can lead to really serious problems
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:46.920]   and even potentially death.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:50.980]   So that's a very serious warning with guanfacine.
[01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:53.180]   So today we discussed a lot of different compounds
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:54.600]   for the treatment of ADHD,
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.420]   and it now should become clear
[01:57:56.420 --> 01:57:59.540]   what the general themes of those compounds is.
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:02.460]   The general theme is that they tend to increase
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:05.080]   overall levels of arousal and wakefulness,
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:07.360]   which leads to decreased levels
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:10.360]   of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and focus.
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:12.720]   And on the face of it, that might seem counterintuitive,
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:16.100]   raise arousal to reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity.
[01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:18.580]   Indeed, that's the case because these compounds,
[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:21.620]   because they act on neuromodulator systems
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:23.880]   like dopamine and norepinephrine
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:26.140]   are effective in creating neuroplasticity.
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:28.020]   They change the strength of the connections
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.620]   in the neural circuits of the brain
[01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:32.100]   that lead to states of heightened focus
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:35.460]   and reduced impulsivity and reduced hyperactivity.
[01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:37.060]   So we talked about the different mechanisms
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:38.560]   by which the different medications
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.640]   for ADHD accomplish this,
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:43.120]   both the typical sort like methylphenidate
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.740]   and Adderall and Vyvanse,
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:46.660]   and some of the atypical compounds
[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:48.540]   that are now being used in addition,
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:51.080]   such as modafinil or modafidil,
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:53.240]   guanfacine, and wellbutrin.
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:55.100]   And where possible, I tried to highlight
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:57.460]   both the short and long-term effects
[01:58:57.460 --> 01:58:59.380]   of these various compounds.
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:02.160]   And I tried to address some of the major concerns
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:03.320]   about these compounds,
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:04.740]   most notably the question of
[01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:07.720]   why are we putting so many kids on amphetamine
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:10.100]   and what is the long-term consequence of that?
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:11.160]   And throughout today's episode,
[01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:13.000]   I tried to highlight both the immediate
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.100]   and long-term benefits,
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:16.480]   but also the immediate and long-term risks
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.300]   that can exist with these compounds.
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:20.800]   Certainly when taken without a prescription,
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:23.180]   recreationally, there is a real risk
[01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:25.980]   for abuse and addiction,
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:29.220]   as well as even a risk for psychotic episodes,
[01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:30.660]   but also the risks that accompany
[01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:33.900]   long-term use of these drugs in people with ADHD.
[01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.380]   And yet it is also clear
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:38.220]   that not treating the symptoms of ADHD
[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:40.340]   carries significant risk as well.
[01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:41.900]   And what's very clear from the scientific
[01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:43.060]   and clinical literature,
[01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:45.680]   and is covered in a significant amount of detail
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:48.380]   in the episode that I did about ADHD,
[01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:50.760]   which you can find at hubermanlab.com,
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:53.220]   is that combinations of drug treatments
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:55.860]   and behavioral protocols seem to surpass
[01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:59.780]   either drug treatments or behavioral protocols alone,
[01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:01.960]   speaking to the tremendous importance
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:05.580]   of combining multiple methodologies when treating ADHD
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:07.580]   and working with a board-certified psychiatrist
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:09.460]   who really understands ADHD
[02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:10.900]   and is really up to date
[02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:14.020]   on all the latest scientific and clinical literature.

[02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:45.980]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:49.000]   but on many previous episodes of the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.120]   we discussed supplements.
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:52.180]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:54.140]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:57.240]   for things like improving sleep, hormone support,
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:58.620]   as well as focus.
[02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:00.460]   The "Huberman Lab" podcast is proud to have partnered
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:01.940]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:03.500]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:05.020]   on the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:07.920]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:10.660]   so it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:12.740]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:15.380]   I am @hubermanlab on all platforms.
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:17.980]   So that's Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram.
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:19.300]   And on all those platforms,
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:21.560]   I post about science and science-related tools,
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:23.100]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:24.260]   of the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:26.380]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:27.540]   on the "Huberman Lab" podcast.
[02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:30.580]   So again, it's @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:31.860]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:33.420]   to our neural network newsletter,
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:36.180]   the neural network newsletter is a monthly newsletter
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:38.580]   in which we distill down the essential points
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:41.400]   of particular podcasts, and we list out toolkits,
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:44.220]   such as toolkits for sleep, toolkits for neuroplasticity,
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:47.260]   toolkits for optimizing dopamine, and on and on,
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:48.900]   all of which is available at zero cost.
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:51.900]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu,
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:53.980]   scroll down to newsletter, and supply your email,
[02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:56.320]   and we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:58.700]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion,
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:00.540]   all about pharmaceutical interventions
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:02.740]   for the treatment of ADHD.
[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:04.940]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:06.780]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:09.360]   (upbeat music)
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:11.940]   (upbeat music)
