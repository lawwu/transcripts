[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.840]   How many of you are short on sleep?
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.500]   Every one of you, raise your hands, come on.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.440]   So there is a rare mutation that happens in patients.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.000]   These are people walking amongst us.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   We have a mutation in a gene called DEC2.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.440]   These patients only need four hours of sleep a night
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.800]   to be completely rested the same way that we have
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.920]   the need for eight to nine hours of sleep a night.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.920]   You interested in getting this gene therapy?
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.800]   We could do this today.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.900]   We haven't yet, but we could do this today.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.140]   (upbeat music)
