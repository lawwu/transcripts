[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   the age times income over 10 rule.
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.400]   Can you talk about this one?
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.140]   - This one was popularized by the wonderful book,
[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.040]   "The Millionaire Next Door," which came out in 1995 or 1996.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.920]   The idea here is to figure out what your net worth
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.800]   should be given your current age and income.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.280]   So the way that this rule works is you take your age
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.680]   and you multiply it by your pre-tax income,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.720]   and then you divide that total by 10.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.240]   This is a rough proxy for what your net worth should be.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   It was an example, let's say you were 50 years old
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.160]   and you make $100,000 per year.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.040]   Multiply those two numbers together, you get 5 million.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.160]   You divide that by 10 and you get 500,000.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160]   Your net worth should be $500,000.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.120]   And then from there, you can actually compare it
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.860]   to what your net worth is to figure out
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.600]   if you are doing better than the average person
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.960]   given your age and income,
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.360]   or worse than the average person given your age and income.
