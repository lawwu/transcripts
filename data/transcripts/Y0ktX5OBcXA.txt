[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   As we consider our next home purchase,
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.720]   they have a growing family.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.400]   There is a big decision as to whether we rent
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.680]   our current home to hang on of this cheap debt.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.520]   What do you think?
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.120]   - Yeah, so this is something that we faced.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.360]   And for me, I just don't want to be a landlord.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.300]   How much incremental money is that going to be?
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.280]   And do I want to be a landlord?
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.000]   And the math for being a landlord works really well
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.200]   if you have full occupancy.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.520]   But the margins on it, at least when I was doing the math,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.920]   seemed to be like, oh, you know, 10, 20%.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.100]   But if someone's not there for a month,
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.020]   like someone moves out and then you got to fill it,
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.140]   it just felt like all that headache,
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.080]   getting the call that the dryer break,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.400]   something's flooding, I don't know.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.580]   I just didn't want to deal with it.
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.900]   So as much as I felt like I had this great asset,
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.240]   I just said, I don't want to be a landlord.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.120]   I will find other great assets to buy or invest in
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.600]   or do something with my time.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.840]   And I sold it.
