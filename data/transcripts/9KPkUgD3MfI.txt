[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - Well, we end the week with a great question
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.720]   from Aaron Fletcher, a dad in Manassas, Virginia.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.640]   Hello, Pastor John, my wife and I recently started
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.060]   going through a catechism with our four-year-old son.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.440]   We've had a hard time explaining to him
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.800]   what it means to glorify God.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.920]   The best definition I can come up with
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.840]   is to glorify God is to worship him
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.700]   like we know how important he is.
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.800]   But that seems inadequate.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.540]   Do you have any advice on how to communicate
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.540]   such a huge concept to young children in a clear way?
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.740]   - Yes, I do. (laughs)
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.740]   And I had a really good time with this question
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.600]   because I think you don't know what you mean
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.260]   unless you can help a four-year-old.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.780]   - Yes, right.
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.700]   - And so, first thing to say is children,
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.340]   oh, how different they are.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.180]   Every parent needs to figure out what works best
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.420]   to get across important truths to their children.
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.760]   So let me simply give the basic principle
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.600]   and then try to provide maybe three illustrations
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.720]   that I think will work with a four-year-old.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.380]   So it's been a long time, but I think so.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.260]   I had four boys and a girl.
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.900]   The basic principle is that glorify
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.900]   does not mean make glorious, but see as glorious,
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.460]   savor as glorious, celebrate as glorious.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.580]   And of course, I don't mean you have to use those words.
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.020]   I'm not giving you yet what you give your four-year-old.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.380]   I'm just telling you what the principle is.
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.480]   I use see, savor, and celebrate
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.180]   just 'cause I like the way they sound. (laughs)
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.060]   You can substitute for see.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.100]   You have to recognize his glory.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.180]   You can substitute for savor.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.860]   You have to enjoy or admire or value his glory.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.660]   And you can substitute for celebrate.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.660]   You have to praise or cheer or make known his glory.
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.940]   And the point is that the word glorify
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.020]   is not like the word beautify.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.340]   Now, I'm still teaching the parents. (laughs)
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.220]   Not like the word beautify.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.220]   When we beautify a room, we make it more beautiful.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.300]   When you glorify God, you do not make him more glorious.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.620]   So glorify has to be distinguished
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.620]   from any idea of making God glorious.
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.660]   You gotta help your four-year-old
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.660]   not think in terms of making God glorious.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.140]   Now, when we glorify God, we see him as glorious.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.980]   We love what we see.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.620]   We help others see him and love him that way.
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.100]   And that may be spoken.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.460]   It may be lived out.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.220]   It may be with acclamations or maybe with demonstrations.
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.060]   And I get that from all over the New Testament,
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.140]   but you can just use 1 Peter 1:3,
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.620]   where it says, "Blessed be God."
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.700]   So he's using words to acclaim the great mercy of God.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.900]   And then when he gets to chapter two, verse 12,
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.060]   he tells them to conduct themselves in a certain way
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.260]   so that people will see God as glorious.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.460]   So it may be words.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.340]   It may be behavior.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.740]   Now, how do we help a four-year-old
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.900]   get a handle on this process?
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.420]   Try this.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.020]   Most four-year-olds can get the idea
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.260]   that some things are small
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.300]   and some things are really, really big.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.740]   They can get the idea
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.140]   that some things are really, really, really valuable
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.260]   and other things aren't worth so very much.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.020]   And they can get the idea
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.820]   that some things are really, really beautiful
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.100]   or really pretty or really nice to look at,
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.820]   and other things are really ugly
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.100]   and make you want to run away.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.700]   I think we can assume that a four-year-old
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.700]   can grasp the categories of size, value, and beauty.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.820]   Okay, that's my assumption
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.580]   as I move forward now with my illustrations.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.100]   So that's what I'm gonna try
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.500]   to help him understand the meaning of glorifying God
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.860]   for his size, really, really big,
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.940]   and his value, really, really precious, valuable,
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.500]   want to have him,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.820]   and his beauty, more beautiful,
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.780]   more great to look at than anything.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.060]   So in each of these cases,
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.540]   we need to come up with illustrations
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.140]   that distinguish between making something big,
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.620]   making something valuable,
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.220]   making something beautiful on the one hand,
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.340]   and helping people see that something is already big,
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.740]   already valuable, already beautiful,
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.460]   even though they might not at first think so.
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.860]   So here are my three practical illustrations.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.220]   So for example, you are driving down the highway,
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.820]   you and your four-year-old,
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.660]   and you might see a tower in the distance
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.660]   and ask your child how big it is.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.980]   Tell him to hold up his fingers,
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.060]   his pointing finger at the top of the tower
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.860]   and his thumb at the bottom of the tower
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.980]   and tell you how big it is.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.980]   And he'll say, "It's not very big."
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.820]   Then you drive another five miles,
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.380]   you stop the car, you get out,
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.700]   you walk over to the tower,
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.700]   and it is 100 times taller than your child is.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.060]   And then you illustrate
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.460]   what you've been teaching him all the while.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.100]   How do we glorify the bigness of this tower?
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.700]   Well, first, we have to get close enough
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.580]   to see how big it really is.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.460]   And then we have to be amazed at how tall it is,
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.500]   very tall, wouldn't want to climb up there.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.780]   And then we need to show people how tall,
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.740]   show people, show people how tall it really is.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.860]   And how might we do that?
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.740]   Well, maybe let's take a picture of me standing beside it
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.420]   and then we'll show the picture, et cetera.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.420]   That's illustration number one.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.220]   Number two, compare your child's daddy,
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.180]   you may be the daddy or the mommy,
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.860]   compare your child's daddy,
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.140]   who is five feet nine inches tall,
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.580]   with another child's daddy,
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.660]   who is six feet six inches tall.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.460]   And then you say to your child,
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.980]   "Do you want to trade your daddy,
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.860]   who's only five feet nine inches tall for a bigger daddy,
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.580]   Roger over there, your friend's daddy?"
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.140]   And your child is going to say,
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.140]   "No, I want my daddy, I don't want his daddy."
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.280]   And then you explain to the child
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.300]   that the reason you want your daddy
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.700]   is because he's so really, really, really valuable to you.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.840]   And you prefer, you introduce that word to him,
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.500]   maybe, prefer him.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.100]   You want him more than you want the other daddy.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.980]   And that's the way it is with the value of God.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.260]   When you know God and how really valuable he is,
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.520]   you want him more than you want anything else.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.260]   And when you want your daddy over all other daddies,
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.780]   you glorify the value of your daddy.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.220]   Doesn't matter whether the other daddy's taller.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.340]   And when you want God over everything else,
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.980]   you glorify the value of God.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.980]   Last illustration, number three, regard to beauty.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.540]   There are stories that your child reads
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.220]   or videos that they watch
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.740]   in which there is a very, very ugly, evil character.
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.740]   And then there's a hero who is gallant
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.180]   and strong and handsome.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.300]   And clearly your child is happy
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.820]   when the hero appears and wins the day
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.820]   and is glad when the ugly, dangerous villain is dispatched,
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.340]   put away, done for.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.900]   And then you explain to your child
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.980]   what the beauty of character is.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.060]   It's not just like the beauty of sunsets or flowers.
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.700]   It's the beauty of strength and wisdom
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.780]   and all of that in the service of being a good hero
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.740]   and a loving hero.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.740]   And you ask your child, how do we glorify that character?
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.900]   How do we glorify the strength and the wisdom
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.620]   and the goodness and the love, the beauty of this hero?
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.340]   And then you can help him see that you glorify him
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.260]   by cheering when he appears in the story
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.980]   and by being glad when he wins
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.260]   and by telling other people how great he is
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.940]   and how beautiful he is
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.980]   compared to that ugly villain
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.540]   that sometimes dresses up in an attractive suit.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.740]   We don't make the tower tall
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.460]   and we don't make the daddy valuable
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.780]   and we don't make the hero beautiful.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.780]   We glorify the size and the value and the beauty
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.940]   by seeing it for what it is
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.860]   and by being glad that it is that way.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.220]   And then by acting and speaking
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.420]   in a way that shows other people what we see
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.420]   and what we love.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.820]   And I think a four-year-old can get this.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.180]   And with every passing year,
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:47.180]   may God grant that his grasp goes deeper and deeper.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.060]   I love this episode.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.020]   The question, the heart behind it,
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.100]   the answer and the trio of illustrations, very helpful.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.940]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.580]   And that'll do it for us for the week.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.340]   For more details about this podcast,
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.860]   to catch up on past episodes
