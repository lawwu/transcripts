[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160]   So let's ask the high philosophical question about money.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.960]   What at the highest level is money?
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.200]   What is money?
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.920]   It's a kind of game and it's a game where we have points and if you have points, there's
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.360]   this one move where you can reduce your points by a number and increase someone else's points
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.000]   by the same number.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.640]   So it's a fair game, hopefully.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.240]   Well, it's one kind of fair game.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.880]   For example, you can have other kinds of fair games.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.080]   You're going to have a game where if I give someone a point and you give someone a point,
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.600]   then instead of that person getting two points, that person gets four points.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.040]   And that's also fair.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.400]   But money is easy to set up and it serves a lot of useful functions.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.640]   And so it just survives in society as a meme for thousands of years.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.440]   It's useful for the storage of wealth.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.880]   It's useful for the exchange of value.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.880]   And it's also useful for denominating future payments, a unit of account.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.240]   A unit of account.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.560]   So if you look at the history of money in human civilization, if you're a student of
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.360]   history, how has its role or just the mechanisms of money changed over time in your view?
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.440]   Even if we just look at the 20th century or before and then leading up to cryptocurrencies,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.840]   that's something you think about?
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.320]   And I think the big thing in the 20th century is we saw a lot more intermediation, I guess.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.400]   The first part is the move from adding more of different kinds of banking.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:53.880]   And then we saw the move from dollars being backed by gold to dollars being backed by
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.960]   gold that's only redeemable by certain people to dollars not being backed by anything to
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:09.560]   an system where you have a bunch of free floating currencies and then people getting bank accounts
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.640]   and then those things becoming electronic.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.160]   People getting accounts with payment processors that have bank accounts.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.240]   So what do you make of that?
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.800]   That's such a fascinating philosophical idea that money might not be backed by anything.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.320]   Is that fascinating to you that money can exist without being backed by something physical?
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   It definitely is.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.280]   What do you make of that?
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   How is that possible?
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.280]   Is that stable?
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.600]   If you look at the future of human civilization, is it possible to have money at the large
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.320]   scale at such a hugely productive and rich societies be able to operate successfully
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.720]   without money being backed by anything physical?
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.040]   I feel like the interesting thing about the 21st century especially is that a lot of the
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.240]   important valuable things are not backed by anything.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.480]   If you look at tech companies, for example, something like Twitter, you could theoretically
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.800]   imagine that if all of the employees wanted to, they could come together, they would quit
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:26.600]   and start working on Twitter 2.0 and just build the exact same product or possibly build
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.680]   a better product and then just continue on from there and the original Twitter would
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.240]   just not have people left anymore.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.240]   There is theoretically code and IP that's owned by the company, but in reality, good
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.320]   programmers could probably rewrite all that stuff in three months.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.120]   The reason why the thing has value is just network effects and coordination problems.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.680]   These employees in reality aren't going to switch all at once and also the users aren't
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.280]   all going to switch at once because it's just difficult for them to switch at once.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.840]   There's these meta stable equilibria in interactions between thousands and millions of people
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.720]   that are just actually quite sticky, even though if you try to assume that everyone's
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.040]   a perfectly rational and perfectly slippery spherical cow, they don't seem to exist at
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   all.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.600]   That stickiness, do you have a sense, a grasp of the fundamental dynamics, the physics of
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.120]   that stickiness?
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:41.840]   It seems to work, and I think some of the cryptocurrency ideas kind of rely on it working.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.440]   It's the sort of thing that's definitely been economically modeled a lot.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.280]   The kind of analogy of something as similar that you often see in textbooks as like, what
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   is a government?
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.000]   Like if, for example, 80% of people in a country just like tomorrow suddenly had the
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.280]   idea that the laws that are currently the laws of the government that currently is the
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.800]   government are just people and some other thing is the government and they just kind
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.480]   of start acting like it, then that would kind of become the new reality.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:24.520]   And then the question is, well, what happens if between zero and 80% of people start believing
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.520]   that?
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.400]   And the thing you see is that if there is one of these kind of switches happening, this
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.720]   kind of revolution, then if you're the first person to join, then you probably don't have
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.920]   the incentive to do that.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.600]   But then if you're the 55th percentile person to join, then suddenly it becomes quite safe
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   too.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.760]   And so it definitely is the sort of thing that you can try to analyze and understand
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:03.240]   mathematically, but one of the kind of results is that the sort of like when the switch happens
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.520]   definitely can be chaotic sometimes.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.640]   But still like to me, the idea that the network affects the fact that human beings at a scale
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:19.040]   like millions, billions can share even the idea of currency, like all agree.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.920]   That's just, I know economists can model it.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.080]   I'm a skeptic on the economic.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.360]   It's like, so my favorite sort of field, maybe recreationally, psychology is trying to understand
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.920]   human behavior.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.880]   And I think sometimes people just kind of pretend that they can have a grasp on human
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.080]   behavior, even though it's such a messy space that all the models that psychology or economics,
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.200]   those different perspectives on human behavior can have are difficult.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.960]   It's difficult to know how much that's wishful thinking and how much it is actually getting
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.220]   to the core of understanding human behavior.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:02.800]   But on that idea, what do you think is the role of money in human motivation?
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:12.520]   So do you think money from an economics perspective, from a psychology perspective is core to like
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.360]   human desires?
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.880]   Money is definitely very far from the only motivator.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:27.000]   It is a big motivator and it's one of the closest things you have to a universal motivator.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.600]   Because ultimately in like almost any person in the world, if you ask them to do something,
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.640]   like there'll be more inclined to do it if you also offer them money.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:44.120]   And that's like, there's definitely many cases where people will do things other than things
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.720]   that maximize how much money they have.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.400]   And that happens all the time.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.480]   But like a lot of those other things are kind of, but much more specific to and of who that
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.160]   person is and of where their situation is, the relationship between the motive and the
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.280]   action and these other things.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.080]   What do you think is the interplay of the other motivator from like Nietzsche perspective
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.760]   is power.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.680]   Do you think money equals power?
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.800]   Do you think those are conflicting ideas?
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.320]   Do you think, I mean, that's the one of the ideas that decentralized currency, decentralized
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.680]   applications are looking at is who holds the power?
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.280]   Money is definitely a kind of power.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.320]   There's definitely people who want money because it gives them power.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:34.200]   And then even if money doesn't seem to kind of explicitly be about money, a lot of things
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:41.160]   that people spend money on are ultimately about social status of some kind.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.680]   And I definitely view those two things as an interplaying.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:52.280]   And then there's also money as just a way of like measuring how successful you are,
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   like as a scoreboard.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   Right.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   So this kind of gets back to the game.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   I mean, like if you have $4 billion, then the main benefit you get from going up, one
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.960]   of the big benefits you get from going up to $6 billion is that now instead of being
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.360]   below the guy who has five, you're above the guy who has five.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.760]   So you think money could be kind of in the game of life, it's also a measure of self-worth.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.640]   It's like how we...
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.480]   It's definitely how a lot of people perceive it.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.920]   Define ourselves in the hierarchy of society.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.520]   Not saying it's a healthy thing that people define their self-worth as money because it's
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:40.680]   definitely far from a perfect indicator of how much value you provide to society or anything
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.680]   like this.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.840]   But I definitely think that as a matter of kind of current practice, a bunch of people
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.440]   do feel that way.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.880]   So what does utopia from an economic perspective look like to you?
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.080]   What does a perfect world look like?
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:07.200]   I guess the economist's utopia would be one where kind of everything is incentive aligned
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:13.840]   in the sense that there aren't enough conflicts between what satisfies your goals and kind
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.120]   of what is good for everyone in the world as a whole.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.640]   What do you think that would look like?
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:29.200]   Does that mean there's still poor people and rich people, there's still income inequality?
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.200]   Do you think Marxist ideas are strong?
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:41.680]   Do you think ideas of objectivism, like where the market rules, is strong?
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.120]   Is there different economic philosophies that just seem to be reflective of what a utopia
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.240]   would be?
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:57.320]   I definitely think that existing economic philosophies do end up kind of systematically
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.360]   deviating from the utopia in a lot of ways.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.480]   One of the big things I talk about, for example, is public goods.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.840]   Public goods are especially important on the internet.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:16.000]   The idea is with kind of money as this game where I lose a few coins and you gain the
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.280]   same number of coins is that this usually happens in a trade where I lose some money,
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:26.240]   you gain some money, you lose a sandwich and I gain a sandwich.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.600]   This kind of model works really well when the thing that we're using money to incentivize
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.320]   is a set of private goods, right?
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.400]   Things that you provide to one person where the benefit comes to one person.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.960]   On the internet especially, but also many, many contexts off the internet, there's actions
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:53.160]   that individuals or groups can take where instead of the benefit going to one person,
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.840]   the benefit just goes to many people at the same time and you can't control who the benefit
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   goes to, right?
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:05.440]   For example, this podcast, we publish it and when it's published, you don't have any fine
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:12.000]   grains control over like, "Oh, these 38,000 people can watch it and then these other 29,000
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   people can't."
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.240]   It's like once the number goes high enough, then people will just copy it.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.480]   And then when I write articles on a blog, then they're just free for everyone and that
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.560]   stuff's even harder to prevent anyone from copying.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:33.480]   Aside from that, things like scientific research, for example, and even taking more pedestrian
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.480]   examples like climate change mitigation would be a big one.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:44.640]   So there's a lot of things in the world where you have these kind of individual actions
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.560]   with concentrated costs and distributed benefits and money as a point system does not do a
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.040]   good job of encouraging these things.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:01.600]   And one of the kind of other things even tangentially connected to crypto, but kind of theoretically
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.520]   outside of it that I work on is this sort of mechanism called quadratic funding.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:17.240]   And the way to think about it is, and if imagine a point system where if one person gives coins
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.480]   to one other person, then it works the same way as money.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:27.800]   But if multiple people give coins to one person and they do so anonymously, so it's kind of
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:33.200]   not in consideration for a specific service to that person themselves, then the number
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.840]   of coins that are received by that person is greater than just the sum of the number
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.220]   of coins that are given by those different people.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.000]   So the actual formula is that you take the square root of the amount that each person
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.200]   gave, then you add all the square roots and then you square the sum.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.280]   Yeah, and then you give that.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:58.560]   And the idea here would basically be that if, let's say, for example, you just started
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.200]   going off and kind of planting a lot of trees and there's a bunch of people that are really
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   happy that you're planting trees and so they go and all kind of throw a coin your way,
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:15.920]   then there is basically the fact that you get more than the sum, you get this kind of
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:23.160]   square of square roots of these tiny amounts, that this actually kind of compensates for
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.200]   the tragedy of the commons.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.640]   There's even this kind of mathematical proof that it sort of optimally compensates for
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.640]   it.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.880]   What is the tragedy of the commons?
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:39.680]   This is just this idea that if there is this situation where there's some public good that
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.280]   lots of people benefit from, then no individual person wants to contribute to it because if
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.080]   they contribute, they only get a small part of the benefit from their contribution, but
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.680]   they pay the full cost of their contribution.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.640]   In which context is this, sorry, what is the term?
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   Quadratic funding.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.560]   In which context is this mechanism useful?
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:08.360]   So obviously you said to combat the tragedy of the commons, but in which context do you
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.160]   see it as useful, actually, practically speaking?
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.760]   Yeah, theoretically, public goods in general.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.960]   So like services, like what are we talking about?
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   What's a public good?
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.480]   Yeah, so within the Ethereum ecosystem, for example, we've actually tried using this mechanism.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.840]   I wrote a couple of articles about this on Vitalik.ca where I go through some of the
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.040]   most recent rounds and it's been really interesting.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:41.120]   Some of the top ones that people supported, there were things like just online user interfaces
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.400]   that make it easier for people to interact with Ethereum.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:56.680]   There was documentation, there were podcasts, there were software clients, implementations
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:05.040]   of the Ethereum protocol, privacy tools, just lots of things that are useful to lots of
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.040]   people.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:11.800]   When a lot of people are contributing, like funding a particular entity, that's really
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   interesting.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:18.520]   Is there something special about the quadratic, the summing of the square roots?
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:24.160]   Yeah, so another way to think about it is like, imagine if N people each give a dollar,
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.000]   then the person gets N squared.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.960]   And so each individual person's contribution gets multiplied by N, right?
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.560]   Because you have N people.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.040]   And so that kind of perfectly compensates for the kind of end to one tragedy of the
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   commons.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.640]   I just wonder if the squared part is somehow fundamental.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.320]   It is.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:50.840]   I'd recommend you go to, on Vitalik.ca, I have this article called "Quadratic Payments
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.960]   a Primer" and highly recommend it.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.560]   It's kind of at least my attempt so far and of exploiting the intuition behind this.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.060]   Thanks.
