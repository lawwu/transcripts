[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420]   - I'd like to talk about neural drive.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.360]   I attribute you with popularizing, maybe you invented it, but certainly popularizing the
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.860]   term like greasing the groove.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.860]   - Thank you.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.560]   - But this notion of greasing the groove completely changed my conceptualization of strength training.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.560]   - Thank you.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.400]   - Because I was weaned more or less trying to run cross country during the cross country
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.840]   season only ran it once, but I greatly enjoyed it and continued that sort of training or
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.580]   trying to put on strength and size and kind of a numbskull young male approach to things,
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.120]   but it served me reasonably well.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.600]   I'm grateful that I included both.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:50.240]   However, I was so tuned to this notion of training a body part, creating an adaptation,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.120]   then waiting for the adaptation to occur and then training the body part again.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.240]   You know, the arguments are all over the internet two times a week, three times a week.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.280]   And then I came across this concept of greasing the groove, which as a neuroscientist felt
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.280]   so intuitively correct and turns out to be correct, you'll explain what it is, but the
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.680]   idea that more frequent training or practicing of a movement opens up a tremendous number
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.520]   of opportunities for development of strength, of size hypertrophy if one wants.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.160]   And I would say just generally more flexibility over one's total fitness program.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.520]   Once one understands this concept, you no longer look at this split or that split or
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.560]   this many reps or that many reps or this volume or that volume, all that is important, but
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.920]   you can start to think about it through the lens of the nervous system.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.580]   And to me, it was like water in a desert to finally encounter something that brought together
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.480]   all these different concepts.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.480]   So could you please explain for people what greasing the groove is?
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.520]   And then I think the implications of it will become obvious, but we'll also spell out
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   what some of those are.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.020]   Andrew, please interrupt me because this is about to become a, this might get really long,
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.440]   so please interrupt me at any time.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.800]   So first I'll talk about the neural component, then we're going to talk about the frequency
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.720]   and the morphological adaptation, structural adaptations as it leads.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.480]   So ladies and gentlemen, grease the groove, we are talking about, let's use an analogy.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.360]   Let's imagine that you are a bow hunter and you're working in your garage and then you
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.800]   walk out of your garage and you shoot an arrow and you just go back to going about your business,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.200]   just working in your garage.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.120]   Or let's say you're a kid who practices martial arts and every, on every break between classes
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.880]   you just go in the corner and you practice your kata.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.960]   This is the best way to practice your skill.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.640]   In small portions, in a spaced out manner.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:50.640]   What's really fascinating is traditional education and traditional strength training is based
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.320]   on the cramming model.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.480]   So remember cramming for an exam.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.440]   So you're studying at night and you somehow squeak by and you pass it.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.640]   Okay, great.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.000]   And then a couple of days later you happily forget everything.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.620]   So in contrast, imagine that you are, let's say you're studying a foreign language.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.800]   You write words on cards and at every opportunity you're standing in line in the bank.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.720]   So the lesser mortals are fooling around on their phones.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.160]   You're just going through your deck like, oh, can I translate this word?
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.640]   I go, put it back in the deck, flip it over.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.060]   The next time you're in some other place, you do this again.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.320]   So this is an example of space practice versus the traditional mass practice.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.240]   And the evidence of the superiority of space practice is just overwhelming.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.040]   It goes back to the 19th century and there's at least like more than a thousand papers
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.540]   published on that.
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.920]   And still very few people do that, which is really sad.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.560]   And strength is a skill.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.640]   So two interesting things happened in the '50s.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.320]   One is Thomas Rush.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.420]   He was an American exercise physiologist.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.520]   He proposed that strength adaptation was largely skill.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.360]   And he looked at pretty much the adaptations.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.760]   He noticed that there's no correlation between the muscle growth and strength.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.120]   Then at the same time, a Soviet scientist, Stepanov was his last name, he was measuring
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.100]   the electrical activity in the muscles of weightlifters who are pressing overhead.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.960]   And back then the press was one of the competition events.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:36.360]   And what he found is as the athletes got stronger after some months, the EMGs started dropping
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.060]   off when they're lifting the same weights.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.640]   So pretty much he found out that the neural system activity became more economical.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.440]   They were able to try less hard, yet still lift the same weights.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.160]   Or pretty much they could try harder and lift even heavier weights.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.960]   And hypertrophy could not explain that because in the '50s, the Soviets were very anti-hypertrophy.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.120]   They were just doing doubles, triples, singles pretty much.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:11.200]   So if we look at what's going on, it's the Hebbian mechanisms.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.640]   So pretty much every time that you activate a particular connection, synaptic connection,
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.360]   you know, between the neurons, that connection becomes stronger.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.300]   So if you did over and over and over.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.200]   So the grease, the groove is the analogy is that command that's coming in from your brain
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.320]   to your muscles, that's the groove.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.040]   That's that pathway.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.280]   And the more you use it, pretty much the more grease it becomes, so it becomes a superconductor.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.920]   So in the future, you don't have to try as hard to lift the same amount of weight, or
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.000]   you can try the same amount and you can lift harder.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.880]   So we haven't even addressed the neural drive yet.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.840]   We just pretty much made the motor neurons more responsive to it.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.680]   And it's a very easy and very simple way to train.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.360]   And strength comes very easily and very, very unexpectedly.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.200]   To make sure that it does happen, you have to address the issue of specificity.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.520]   So specificity pretty much means without getting too much into the weeds, to get stronger,
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.600]   first of all, you need to lift weights that are heavy enough.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.360]   And if you're looking about percentages of one rep max, we're looking at like 75 to 85,
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   typically.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.240]   If you go too light, you don't make the impression on your nervous system, and it's just not
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.480]   specific enough.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.600]   If you go too heavy, very quickly, you're just going to burn yourself out.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.440]   And so pretty much like it's a weight that's heavy enough to respect and light enough not
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.380]   to fear.
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.000]   And the second of all, and this is very surprising, is you only do about half or fewer reps that
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.700]   you possibly could do.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.120]   So for example, let's say that you're lifting 80% of your one rep max.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.720]   And let's say that you're able to do eight reps maximum with it.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.320]   That's your-- we're just fairly common.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.680]   Well, you're only going to do about three to four reps per set.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.280]   And that's it.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.600]   And the gym bros at this point go crazy, like, where's the intensity?
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.880]   Well, intensity in strength training is just how heavy the weight is.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.920]   It has nothing to do with the effort.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.280]   And it's been proven over and over that that's much more important than how hard you're exerting
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.280]   yourself.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.280]   There are times for that.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   There are absolutely times for that.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.480]   But if the weight is heavy enough, and if you do half the repetitions that you possibly
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.520]   could do, you're going to get stronger.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.760]   It's very safe.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.840]   And you're not going to burn out psychologically.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.080]   And it's also very easy on your body.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:48.640]   So also, that builds muscle as well, purely because you're able to do a very high volume
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.640]   of work.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.280]   I'm not able to explain the mechanism why it builds muscle.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.920]   But as the Soviets found out in weightlifting research, there's a correlation between the
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.940]   volume and-- Robert Trollman-- between the volume and the hypertrophy, everything else
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.680]   being equal, you're going to get bigger.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.080]   So almost every day, you're doing the sets of three, four reps, maybe even five, and
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.040]   they start adding up.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.900]   And before you know it, you're stronger.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.240]   And at the same time, you have developed muscle.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:25.760]   So to summarize the grease, the groove, you're trying to train moderately heavy as often
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.000]   as possible, while staying as fresh as possible.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.640]   And if you decide to do it in the gym, a very simple protocol would be a set every 10 minutes.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.640]   It sounds really bizarre.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.640]   Like, why?
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.060]   Why would you rest for so long?
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.760]   This apparently has to do with initial memory consolidation.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.540]   Because so much is still unknown.
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.200]   So we do know the grease, the groove works great.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.000]   But we speculate that some of it has to do with some of the same phenomena related to
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.400]   learning in other fields.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.680]   So if you're doing something over and over, like you're saying two plus two is four, two
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.760]   plus two is four, you're just using your short-term memory.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.440]   You're not memorizing anything.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.440]   But if you say two plus two is four, you go get a coffee, you come back, and you try two
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.240]   plus two, four.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.840]   So there's that desirable difficulty that you have in there.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:22.480]   And you have to process that instead of just go through the groove.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.440]   That apparently helps this adaptation.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.840]   So rest for at least 10 minutes.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:32.440]   Do sets of about the repetitions of half of what you're possibly able to do.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.280]   And you know, listen to your body.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.840]   Typically train two, three days in a row, and then take a day off, but listen to your
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   body.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.600]   Incidentally, this grease-the-groove is the topic of my next book.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   I have completed it.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.620]   It's not published yet.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.800]   If you look at-- I can't pronounce the Hungarian professor's last name.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   Csikszentmihalyi.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   Thank you.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   Thank you.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   I appreciate that.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.240]   So he's talking about that perfect challenge, perfect practice lies in that channel between
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.840]   boredom and anxiety.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.000]   So if you put yourself in that channel, and if you keep lifting this moderately heavy
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.840]   weights, with a moderate effort over and over and over, you're going to get strong.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.800]   That's one of the many ways to get stronger.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.600]   Are you doing anything in the rest periods between these 10 minutes?
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.560]   So is it, let's say, bench press, wait 10 minutes till you bench press again.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.000]   But in the meantime, you're doing Zercher squat five minutes after the first bench press?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.640]   That's one of the ways to do that.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.540]   You can do up to three exercises at the same time.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.960]   So let's say, like, Zercher squat and a bench press, and maybe a third thing.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.120]   Let's say those two are enough.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.900]   And another option is you can do that.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.840]   You can incorporate this into, if you would do only one exercise, you can squeeze it into
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.360]   your lifestyle or your athletic practice.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:55.720]   So for example, in, let's say, you're teaching a track practice or martial arts class.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:01.440]   And every 10 minutes on the clock, you just have the class do, drop and do three hard,
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.700]   let's say, three one-arm push-ups, and then get back to the class.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.000]   So there's no interference whatsoever.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   In fact, it's better than no interference.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.320]   Back in the '60s, Soviets found out something called the strength after effect.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.680]   So if you do strength work that's not exhausting in nature and that's not novel to you, it
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:28.200]   has a tonic effect just for anything that you can do with your brain or with your body,
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   anything.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.640]   And they would even do some coaches, they would do so-called strength warm-up.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.160]   They would warm up, as usual, for a track class, let's say, track practice.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.920]   Then they would do, let's say, three sets of three of something, like with 80% max,
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.880]   which is not much.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.640]   And they start their practice.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.880]   Then the coach noticed that the athletes are starting to droop a little.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.800]   He'll repeat that, you know.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.740]   He might repeat that up to three times.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:12:01.380]   So what you have is by having this short, very small dose, like a nanopractice of strength,
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.600]   you rejuvenate yourself and your productivity increases so much.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.840]   So whether you want to just do the strength exercise, several of them in that one hour
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:14.700]   period, or whether you want to combine that with writing a great American novel, that's
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.700]   your business.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.200]   I suppose if someone has access to the appropriate equipment at home, you could incorporate grease
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.800]   the groove into your entire day.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.020]   That's ideal, yes.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.980]   And obviously it's difficult with some equipment, but what you could do, you could use the heavy-duty
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:28.980]   grippers.
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.520]   You could do one-arm push-ups.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.740]   You could keep a kettlebell under your desk and press it at every opportunity.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.460]   And again, the idea is really just practice.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.980]   You just try to hit a perfect, perfect trap.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:51.300]   And notice that if you have some issues, if you're a warm-up-dependent person for orthopedic
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.460]   issues, I'm talking about warm-up and very much in the body, not the mind in this particular
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.740]   case, then it might not be appropriate for you.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.260]   Although, you know, with 10-minute rest, it might still be okay.
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:11.140]   But practicing a skill without the warm-up, that means rehearsal, is very powerful for
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.840]   improving that skill.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.660]   People think they automatically equate performance with improvement, with learning, but it's
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.540]   not so, not at all.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:24.900]   When you're doing something that's just out of the blue, it's, you know, the way a sniper
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.840]   would take a cold shot.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.760]   That's so much harder because you have to have produced that solution.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:36.640]   Or maybe an example that's closer to most viewers, golf.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.260]   You go to the driving range, you start hitting it, and like, wow, you're amazing.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.400]   You just get yourself fine-tuned, you hit, you're perfect.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.020]   Then you go and you play the game, and you cannot replicate that.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:54.560]   Because suddenly, different club, different topography, everything's different, and you
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.280]   didn't have the luxury of that tuning yourself up right there.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.200]   So it feels, it doesn't feel like you're stronger, but you are going to get much stronger.
