[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.120]   A female podcast listener who asks to remain anonymous
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.880]   writes in, "Pastor John, I go to a pretty small church
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.340]   "with limited resources and over the past two years
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.540]   "I've noticed our pastor using more and more
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.680]   "pre-packaged sermon series.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.240]   "So much so that I can actually search online
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.800]   "and find the outline or another church
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.680]   "that has done the series and listen
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.380]   "to almost the exact same sermon beforehand.
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.640]   "What are your thoughts on this?
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.280]   "Is it biblical or permissible?
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.080]   "It just doesn't sit right with me, but I'm not sure why."
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.600]   - Well, I'm glad she asked that question
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.080]   instead of asking me what she should do about it
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.920]   because I have very strong feelings
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.880]   about the questions she asked and find it easy to answer
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.300]   and I wouldn't have such strong convictions
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.000]   or clear ideas about what strategy she should take now.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.640]   I have tried over the years to imagine a situation
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.900]   in which I might feel peace or authentic
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.020]   in using another person's outline or sermon as my own.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.460]   And I have never been able to imagine such a situation.
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.460]   It seems frankly, utterly unthinkable to me
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.540]   that authentic preaching would be the echo
[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.100]   of another person's encounter with God's word
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.340]   rather than a trumpet blast of my own encounter
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.760]   with God's word.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.760]   Now, to be sure, my sermon should be an echo.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.660]   It should be an echo of the voice of God,
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.660]   but not an echo of an echo of the voice of God.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.320]   So that's my conviction.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.980]   Now, here are a few reasons why.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.900]   And keep in mind, I'm not talking
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.840]   about the problem of plagiarism.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.500]   That's plainly a sin.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.660]   I'm talking about the use of another man's sermon
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.700]   or outline even if you do acknowledge
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.180]   that it comes from another person,
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.760]   in which case it wouldn't be plagiarism.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.900]   You're giving him credit for it.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.900]   Perhaps it goes without saying, but not really,
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.900]   preaching in worship is warranted by the Scripture.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.260]   It's not just something we thought was a neat thing to do.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.980]   And it's warranted by the very nature, I think,
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.400]   of God's truth.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.460]   Right after describing the inspiration and usefulness
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.580]   of all the Scripture in 2 Timothy 3,
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.580]   Paul says, first verse of chapter four,
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.500]   "I charge you in the presence of God and of Jesus Christ,
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.620]   "who is to judge the living and the dead,
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.540]   "and by his appearing in his kingdom, preach the word."
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.100]   So it's right there in the context of the usefulness
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.860]   of the word in the life of the church.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.540]   And the Greek word used for preach is not the same as teach.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.540]   It's a word for heralding and exalting in the things spoken.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.860]   So my definition of preaching is expository exaltation.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.940]   That's E-X-U-L, not A-L, E-X-U-L.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.820]   Expository exaltation.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.820]   Expository in the sense that there's always truth
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.780]   and explanation in it, and exaltation in the sense
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.140]   that the preacher is never indifferent
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.580]   to what he's explaining.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.260]   He's exalting over it, he's glorying in it,
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.340]   he's worshiping through it and in it.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.180]   So preaching is not the same as teaching,
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.140]   even though there are elements of explanation
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.020]   and teaching in it.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.980]   And the context in 2 Timothy is the church,
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.140]   not just street corner evangelism,
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.660]   where you might imagine lifting up your voice and heralding,
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.740]   but in the church, week in and week out.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.740]   So at the very heart of preaching is seeing the beauty
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.380]   of truth and feeling the value of truth.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.380]   Preaching is a heralding of the beauty
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.340]   the preacher has seen, and it is the exaltation
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.820]   in the beauty the preacher has felt.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.720]   Now, that means that the first reason I have problems
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.220]   with secondhand sermons is that they seem to expose
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.740]   a failure on the part of the preacher
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.740]   to see the beauty of truth and feel the value of truth.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.900]   He's having to go to someone else
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.100]   to see what he ought to see in the Word.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.780]   He's having to go to someone else to express the feelings
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.620]   he ought to feel when he reads the Word.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.620]   This is a symptom of something gone deeply wrong
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.800]   and in need of quick remedy in the preacher.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.460]   Second, I have problems with secondhand sermons
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.460]   because I think preaching and teaching
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.320]   is the pastor's calling.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.000]   It's his job.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.680]   He's supposed to spend whatever it takes
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.280]   to know the scriptures and to make them plain
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.200]   for his people, and as a pastor of a local church,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.960]   his job is to read the scriptures
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.800]   and understand the scriptures specifically
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.460]   in relation to the needs of his flock.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.360]   He's not supposed to be a generic preacher.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.880]   He's supposed to guard this flock and feed this flock
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.280]   because he knows and loves this flock.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.240]   Paul says in 1 Timothy 5:17,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.160]   "Let the elders who rule well
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.540]   "be considered worthy of double honor,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.540]   "especially those who labor in preaching and teaching."
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.160]   Now that last phrase,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.620]   those who labor in preaching and teaching,
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.420]   defines the calling of the preacher.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.640]   This is his work.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.720]   He should labor in the study of the scriptures
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.520]   until he sees God's Word for his people
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.040]   and feels it with joy.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.160]   That's the second reason.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.880]   Here's the third reason that I stumble
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.560]   over this whole issue of secondhand outlines
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.320]   and secondhand sermons.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   1 Timothy 3:2 says that an elder should be apt
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.120]   or able, gifted to teach.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.680]   In other words, it's not just our calling
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.080]   to study and preach the Word, it's our gifting.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.800]   And if it isn't, we should not be in this role,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.880]   the Bible says.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.200]   The gifting for teaching means
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.360]   that you don't have to be a secondhander.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.680]   That's what the gift means.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.720]   If you have to be a secondhander,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.200]   then you don't have the gift of being a firsthander.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   Seeing and savoring and saying what God said,
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.280]   not what someone else says God said,
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.520]   that's the gift of preaching and teaching.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.080]   So in conclusion, God is not calling pastors.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.760]   Maybe pastors labor under this expectation.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.880]   God is not calling pastors to be eloquent.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.120]   He's not calling for the best preaching in the world.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.720]   He's not calling for the most clever turn of phrase.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.200]   He's not calling for the most relevant reference
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   to the news or the media or some profound insight
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.040]   into the text that only somebody else can have.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.960]   What God is calling to every pastor
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   is that every one of us be faithful, authentic
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.360]   in our encounter with the meaning of the text
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.160]   for the sake of our people,
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.720]   delivered with heartfelt passion for God and for the people.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.800]   I just think that the people want their pastor
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.880]   to be their pastor.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.600]   See what's in the text for us, pastor.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.720]   Love us with the word, pastor.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.640]   Teach us what you've seen in the word, pastor.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.480]   We don't want your canned borrowings from other people.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.040]   We want you to get on your face
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.160]   before the living God over his word.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.040]   Plead with him, wrestle with the text
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.440]   until you see what we need to hear from his word.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.440]   So yes, I am very, very concerned about secondhand sermons.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.600]   And I pray that God would give fresh life
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.400]   and fresh gifting and fresh calling
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.520]   and fresh eyes to every pastor
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.520]   who's using other people's outlines
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.060]   and other people's sermons.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.440]   - That's gold.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.480]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.840]   And we've been tackling topics like this one

[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.200]   who wants to know if John Piper would ever consider
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.400]   using his look at the book technology
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.300]   of marking up a Bible text.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.000]   Would he ever use that during a sermon?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.460]   We'll find out tomorrow.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.400]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.240]   with author and longtime pastor, John Piper.
