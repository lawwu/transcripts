[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.520]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.640]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and each week I sit down with the world's best
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.280]   experts to learn the strategies, tactics, and frameworks that shape their success.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.640]   Before we get started this week, I want to give a big shout out to Chris Van
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.360]   Vliet, host of the fantastic podcast Insight, who introduced me to our
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.200]   guest today, Brant Penvitic.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.120]   Brant is an award-winning film director and veteran television producer with
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.240]   decades of experience working on shows like MasterChef and The Biggest Loser.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.560]   He's also a C-level sales and presentation coach and keynote speaker.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.720]   But I learned about Brant from his bestselling book, The Three Minute Rule,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.000]   Say Less to Get More from Any Pitch or Presentation, which teaches anyone how
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.840]   to use Hollywood's storytelling techniques in business to persuade and succeed.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.040]   Today, we're going to talk about why it's critical to dial in your pitch in
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.760]   the first three minutes, maybe even the first 10 seconds, including how to do it.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.320]   Why in those three minutes, you need to answer four questions so people won't
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.720]   tune you out, and of course, what those questions are and how to answer them
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.480]   succinctly.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.720]   I'm going to ask him what he thinks of my pitch for All The Hacks and how to
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.640]   improve it, and I want to hear about his travel adventures.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.640]   Last year, his family sold their home and took a 48 state RV trip.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.240]   I want to know what he learned and whether he'd do it again.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.720]   And I'm sure there'll be more.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.000]   So let's get started.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.080]   Brant, welcome to the show.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.240]   Hey, what's up, man?
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.280]   Happy to be here.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.560]   So let's just jump right into this three minute rule.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.440]   Dive in.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.240]   You've said it's really a way to teach people how to use the Hollywood
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.680]   storytelling techniques to say less and get more.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.200]   How did you get so good at pitching shows and persuading people?
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.120]   And how did that lead to this three minute rule?
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.480]   And listen, I'm a Hollywood producer by trade.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.240]   When I was early to the business, I was running around pitching shows and
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.800]   trying to make my way.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   And I was at the lobby of CBS.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.120]   I remember when this happened, I was in the lobby of CBS and getting ready to go
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.920]   in for my pitch meeting.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.000]   And as I was there, I walked from the pitch room, Simon Cowell.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.200]   And I was like, Oh, hey, Simon.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.960]   And we were chatting a little bit and I was thinking to myself, Oh man, I hate
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.080]   pitching after that guy who's not excited to hear his pitch, which is great.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.320]   And so as we're chatting, I can see him looking over my shoulder.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.800]   And when that happens, I look over and it's Mark Burnett.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.600]   And so Mark Burnett is coming in right after me.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.720]   And I'm thinking like, so now I'm wedged between these two superstars, right?
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.080]   And I got such anxiety.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.040]   I am such a newbie and no one cares.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.520]   And I'm going into the pitch, the president of the network.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.360]   What am I going to say?
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.120]   What sort of fun thing, small talk crap am I going to go through that makes this
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.840]   make any sense that the president is going to want to hear?
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.360]   Like he's not going to care.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.520]   So I just got into this panic.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.080]   And as I was in the room and we'd said, hi, and everybody sat down, I was like, I
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.000]   got to get out of this room.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.240]   I got to just tell them what the show is.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.080]   I got to get the hell out of here.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.200]   Like they don't want to hear from me.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.320]   So I literally just said, here's the show.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.160]   Here's how we would produce it.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.520]   Here's why we think it's good for you.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.040]   Here's what we think it's going to cost.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.680]   And I'm out of here.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.800]   And I was in and out of that minute in nine minutes.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.080]   And my agent was like, Oh my God, that was the best pitch we've ever done.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.120]   And CBS bought the show.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.920]   And so I started doing that more often where I was just like, okay, so what if I
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.200]   don't tell Fox about how product placement in this show is going to work?
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.560]   Because they do that for a living and they kind of have an entire department.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.600]   Like they don't need to hear from me.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.400]   And I remember being an NBC and the guy who ran it was a very good producer on my
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.760]   side of the field and went over to run the network.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   And so I remember pitching shows and being like, why am I getting in all this crap
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.000]   with him?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.400]   He's a better producer than I am.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.160]   Once I gave him the basic idea, he's going to figure this stuff out.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.960]   So I got this reputation very quickly about having some of the best pitches in
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.480]   Hollywood.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.400]   And the irony was, it was like, I wasn't really doing anything.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.760]   Like I was doing less.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.880]   I was saying less.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.520]   I wasn't trying as hard.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.840]   I happened to be conveying more confidence.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.400]   I was able to get the buyers to offer more of their suggestion.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.080]   Everything just started going my way.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.840]   And so we started to develop this system that it was like what we use in the edit
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.000]   bay of a three minute scene.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.720]   Like you can't have a scene go more than three minutes.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.840]   You have to resolve all the conflict, blah, blah, blah.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.160]   There's a lot of science behind three minutes itself about how the human brain
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.960]   processes information and makes decisions.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.200]   And so I just realized I'm using this three minute rule across everything.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.160]   And when I started to apply that across other businesses besides television, it
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.000]   worked even better than it did in television.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.800]   So that's how it all started.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.360]   You also mentioned that there's like the three minute version and the 10 second
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.680]   version.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.600]   And some people make even quicker judgments.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.760]   How do you think about the span of that three minutes?
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.640]   Well, and then people ask me a long time, "What do I say first?"
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.960]   and all that.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.120]   That's a big thing for people.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.080]   The three minute rule basically says that everything about your business product or
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.360]   service must be conveyed clearly, concisely, and accurately in three minutes or
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.920]   less.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.840]   The key is you need to get your audience to buy into the general concept before
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.720]   they make the yes or no decision.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.520]   Everybody listening to this right now has had someone come pitch or present them or
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.680]   want to get them to do something.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.360]   And in the first 10 seconds, you're already thinking, "I don't think I like
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.640]   this.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.920]   I don't know.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.600]   I'm sure I want this."
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.880]   Right?
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.360]   And that's because the person has not let you grow into that decision.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.120]   You have been forced to make that instantly by big statements.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.480]   And there's a whole bunch of things that I talk about in the book on how you get
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.000]   people to be almost defensive, almost make a decision and then defend it.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.040]   As opposed to get all the information and then make a decision.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.480]   And so the three minute rule, if you do it really well, you could extend someone's
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.400]   yes or no in their mind to about a maximum of three minutes if you do it really
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.680]   well.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.560]   But you don't need three minutes, a minute and a half, sometimes two minutes,
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.560]   whatever is required.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   It is about what needs to be said, not what you want to be said.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.280]   So there's a book, people can read it.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   I enjoyed it.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.480]   I would highly recommend it.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.240]   But what's the high level of how you lay out those three minutes?
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.360]   So it's called the WAC method, W-H-A-C.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.080]   And that's basically the structure for any pitch or presentation, how you can
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.840]   convey the information.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.600]   Anytime you want to convey something to someone or convince them to do something
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.280]   or try to get them to your way of thinking, think of it in the WAC method.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.320]   W-H-A-C.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.000]   The W is...
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.960]   What is this?
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.680]   Literally.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.160]   What is it?
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.120]   H is how does it work?
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.080]   Those are the first two questions anybody has on anything that's going on.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   If you've ever had somebody droning on about something and you're like,
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.040]   could you just tell me what this is and like how it works?
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.880]   Like that's all your brain wants.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.720]   It needs to find that.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.720]   It's called a three-step rationalization.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.160]   First, we conceptualize.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.320]   We have to understand what it is.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.080]   Then we contextualize.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.000]   We got to put context to us, how it works for us.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.880]   And then we actualize, which is like, okay, how do I get it?
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.840]   So what is it is literally tell me what it is.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.760]   I am a, I'm a personal trainer that trains Hollywood
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.480]   actors for major action films.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.000]   Okay.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.720]   That is one sentence.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.640]   And everybody listening now has a pretty good idea what my buddy Jeff does.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.160]   You actually kind of know it right away.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.640]   Okay.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.440]   That's what is it?
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.800]   Then it's how does it work?
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.280]   Okay.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.520]   Well, how does he do that?
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:58.640]   I move in to the celebrity's home and live with them for 90 days.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.000]   So they never break program, never break diet.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.520]   Okay.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.080]   That is two sentences.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.840]   Now, do I really need to go into all that much?
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.880]   Or have you already made an idea of how this works?
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.120]   Right?
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.480]   Your brain is saying, I get what he does.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.880]   I get his method.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.720]   Now you're either interested, not interested, whatever, but you're there.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.040]   Right.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.800]   I have a fundamental house.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.640]   There you go.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.720]   You're like, that's kind of cool.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.080]   Okay.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.640]   The next is the a, are you sure?
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.160]   It's sort of like, wait, can you validate that?
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.560]   I don't care about your facts and your figures until I understand what it is.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:30.920]   You do.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:36.800]   People want to start with their history and their stats and all the size of the
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.680]   market and all this other crap that no one cares about until I have context and
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.200]   structure.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.000]   That's it.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.880]   So when you talk about, are you sure I'm using it as a second phase, which is I
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.440]   have given you the basic of what I do and how it works.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.640]   And now I'm going to explain to you the value of it.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.640]   I'm going to give you some context, how it works for you.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.160]   I trained Chris Hemsworth.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.600]   I trained the rock.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.240]   I trained Mark Wahlberg.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.360]   Now you're like, okay, so you're pretty good at your gig.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.120]   Or I know those aesthetics.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.040]   I understand that.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.200]   Or I've done this for 15 years.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.800]   That's the, are you sure about it?
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.560]   I trained Hollywood actors for big action films.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.960]   I moved into their house nine days.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.480]   They never met.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.320]   They never left.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.400]   I've trained some of the biggest actors in Hollywood, including, right.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.920]   Three sentences.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.840]   And now you're like, okay, I get it.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.840]   And then the final piece is, can you do it?
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.920]   Which is effectively, what do I have to do to make this happen?
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.280]   How much is it going to cost?
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.240]   Do you have a patent?
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   When is it available?
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.360]   How's the supply?
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.400]   How do you get paid?
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.320]   Like all those things, all the things about the actualization of the element.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.760]   Come later, right after all this stuff is done.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.120]   Now I care about that.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.920]   And the irony is it's the smallest piece.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.520]   The smallest piece is like, how much does it cost?
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.400]   Is it available now?
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.000]   If I buy into everything else, I will find a way to make the,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.880]   can you do it work?
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.440]   If you have this great idea and all these things work, but at the end of it,
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.120]   you're like, but I've never done before.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.000]   I'm not even sure how to do it.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.240]   Okay, well, let's figure that out.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.520]   Right.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.960]   Jeff says, can you do it?
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.000]   Is I only work with major studios.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.880]   They pay me directly per film.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.480]   My booking right now is nine months in advance.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.480]   Okay.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.120]   So now you're like, oh my God, I totally get it.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.280]   Right.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.280]   That's basically his pitch.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.120]   Now, from that point, the conversation opens up, everything starts opening up.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.360]   When did you get started?
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.120]   How often does it work?
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.800]   What do we do for food?
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.400]   Who pays for that?
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.080]   Where do you live?
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.600]   I don't have a place.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.760]   There's a million questions at a million conversations to have from that pitch.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.040]   You just can't put all of that in the pitch.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.840]   You have to trust the fact that if you get people to those first basic
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.680]   structures and get them through that, they're going to want to know more.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.120]   If you can't get someone to be interested in those basic structures, you have no
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.880]   hope of getting them interested just by talking more and giving them more
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.440]   information.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.000]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.480]   It has the opposite effect.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.400]   The more you talk, the less confident you appear, the less value you convey.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.680]   That is the end of the story.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.440]   And so after you've conveyed all that, whether it's a minute and a half, three
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.960]   minutes, is it silence?
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.040]   Just let people ask questions or your example, you went nine minutes.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.960]   It's like there's two versions, right?
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.880]   One is you have somebody that's like an interactive person.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.240]   And that's usually where it's like questions kind of thing.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.520]   Right.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.040]   So you're a minute and a half in and you've got the basic points and then you
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.600]   can like start talking about elements.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.280]   Like they understand asking questions, have them go through stuff.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:28.800]   That's easy.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.120]   A lot of times you're making a presentation to multiple people and you can't just be
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.080]   like, okay, I'll take questions from the field.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.400]   So what I normally do is have a transition that feels like you would say, I'm going
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.840]   to answer some of the questions.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.800]   I'm sure you probably have, because what you're doing then is let's get into the
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.320]   engagement.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:49.000]   Let's get into the details, the nitty gritty, the stuff that you're going to find
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.360]   interesting and all those kinds of things that helps people get that transition
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.600]   between now we're engaging.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.240]   And now I'm informing the first step is to inform and lead.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.160]   And then the next stage two is engage and follow.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.720]   Those two are very separate pieces.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.320]   And it's the one thing I find most people get mixed up is that they try to start an
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.200]   engagement conversation before anybody really understands what it is they're
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.720]   working with.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.080]   When you work with people or help people, for example, is how long does it take to
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.320]   get that three minutes?
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.800]   It seems like if it's the most important thing, you should be spending the bulk of
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.920]   your planning on honing that first bit.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.160]   It's taken me 20 years to learn how to say things in three minutes.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.440]   Right.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:30.360]   It's difficult and it's more difficult depending on how big your personality is.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.880]   Ironically, like I train a lot of companies and some of my best students are the
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:41.920]   biotech scientist type guys with the most complex of companies and drug therapies
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.600]   and whatnot.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.560]   And oil and gas guys are good too, because they don't want to perform.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.360]   They don't want to overcome the audience with their cool awesomeness.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.400]   They just want to tell people what's going on.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.560]   They're excited about their product.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.720]   They're excited about their company.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.320]   I can strip all that down for them and be like, just tell these things and you'll
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.360]   get to say all this other stuff about the gene therapy and the, you'll get there.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.240]   Just say these things so people understand.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.440]   And then they'll want to talk and they love that.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.040]   But it takes me a full day.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.960]   I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.280]   When I wrote the book, the publisher was like, Hey, don't write the forward to the
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.680]   book until you're done the entire book.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.200]   Cause then you'll know all the details and you can like really nail that.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:19.360]   Right.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.880]   Cause that's how people decide they're going to read a book.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.440]   So I did a little research.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.400]   Turns out people in a business book read usually the first four to six pages before
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.080]   they make a decision.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.000]   Then the average business book has a forward of 11 pages.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.720]   And I was like, four pages is about three minutes to read.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.600]   No surprise.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.840]   So I was like, Oh my God, this is genius.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.600]   I'm going to start the book saying that the average business book is 11 pages.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   The average person takes four pages.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.280]   That takes three minutes.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.040]   So I got three minutes to make you want to basically read the rest of the book.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.640]   I was like, yeah, this is going to be great.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.480]   Three minute push for my book.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.760]   So I went on vacation cause I had finished the book.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.200]   I'm in Jamaica, my wife.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.400]   And I was like, gate, I'm going to take the first day or so.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.040]   I'm going to write this intro and send it off to publisher.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.240]   Then I'm going to take the rest two weeks and stay on the beach and have a good
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.080]   time.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.040]   First pass of writing my Ford or for the book, 14 pages long.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.160]   Right.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.000]   And it was good.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.560]   I was like, Oh my God.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.600]   So I cut it down and I spent the next day just trying to edit it.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.840]   And it's 10 pages long, nine pages, eight pages.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.200]   I got to seven pages and then I start negotiating with myself.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.520]   Well, this is so good.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.520]   It's written so well.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.400]   I really need people to hear this right away.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.560]   I can't wait till later.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.640]   Maybe this is the time when it's this good and this important that the three
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.960]   minute thing isn't as important.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.720]   I was like, what the hell's wrong with me?
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.480]   So I even called the publisher and I asked him, it was like four pages.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.040]   Like, is that just any size page?
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:42.640]   Or is it words?
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   He's like, no, it's words.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.440]   That's how it works.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.680]   So I'm looking at the word count.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.080]   I'm like, Oh my God, I couldn't finish it in two weeks.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.920]   Couldn't do it.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.000]   Couldn't get it done on the trip.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.360]   I had to come back home.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.720]   I had to go to my office.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.360]   I had to take out my sticky notes and do my entire whack method from the very
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.640]   beginning for my own book, an expert who does this for a living.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.800]   And I had to take the whole thing and finally got it to my four pages.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.280]   It's just because I became so precious about the information.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.480]   And in fact, I don't tell a lot of people this, but there are drafts of the book
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.080]   that they send around to some press and stuff like that before they print the
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.920]   final version.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.040]   There are a few draft copies that have, I'm going to say three quarters of a
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   page from my original intro that I pushed into the first chapter because I was so
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.880]   in love with it.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.240]   And it wasn't until after it all said none, I read it again.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.000]   I was like, Oh my God, this is total drivel.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.840]   Like this is crap.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.600]   And I forced my publisher to take it out and redo it.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.400]   I still think there's one or two sentences I probably could have cut, but
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.440]   when you're precious about your information and when you're really
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.040]   passionate, it's very difficult to chop the bodies away and kill the dead weight.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.560]   And so for me with clients, it's very,
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.160]   very different because I can tell you right away what's dead weight.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.920]   I can tell you right away what to put off to the side and wait.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.160]   So the book really trains you to try to find those pieces.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.960]   It isn't, Hey, where this certain color tie and your pitch will be better. No,
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.480]   here's the way to find out what you should be saying first,
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.680]   what you should be in second.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.760]   What should you be saying last and what you shouldn't be saying at all.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.880]   So I want to go two places, but I'll ask one quick question.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.080]   You said this isn't the color tie. Does it even matter what you wear to a pitch?
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.160]   No, no, none of that matters. It doesn't matter what you say.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.680]   None of that crap matters anymore.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.120]   People are so inundated with information and details and all this crap.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.600]   They're just not interested in all those other things. None of that works.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.480]   We used to train salespeople to use their person's name. Hi, Dave.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.280]   Hi, John. Hey, John. How are you, John? Have you thought about this, John?
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.080]   Like use your client's name over and over again.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.200]   Could you imagine if someone did that to you today?
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.440]   That's the reality of a hypersensitive audience.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.640]   Unless you're doing something that's a detriment,
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.720]   none of that stuff impacts you whatsoever.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.840]   Everybody wants to sift through that and get to the good stuff.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.160]   And then the second I'm going to go in, I sent you this in advance.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.000]   So I'm going to ask you about my show.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.760]   I'm constantly talking to everyone from sponsors or shows for me to
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.960]   go on and try to explain what we do. And I'm super passionate.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.720]   So if you're great because it's not your show, it knocking down the bodies,
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.520]   to try to narrow it down. I'm curious what you thought of what I sent.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.680]   This was the description of all the hacks.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.920]   I'll give you that in two pieces. Your description of the show,
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.440]   your intro of the show, what the show is, is really good.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.080]   Super solid because you're doing it for the consumer.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.480]   And there's not a lot to get into what a podcast is and what it contains.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.920]   And you were pretty clear about like, Hey,
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.320]   I give you all the great travel hacks, save money. I got more fun stuff.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.760]   Like it's nice and clean. Could it be a little bit less wordy? Sure.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.080]   Would it make any difference? Most likely not. Like it's relatively simple.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.360]   You keep it relatively simple.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.960]   I will say that your outreach email to get people like me and Chris and other
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.480]   people on is way too pretty and conveys a
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.800]   sense of not desperation's too much,
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.640]   but conveys a sense of less value than you want to convey. Right.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.200]   Because you're pitching here's the size of the audience, which is impressive.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.320]   Here's this stuff. If Joe Rogan wanted me on the podcast,
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.000]   do you think he'd put a paragraph in there about his show and how big it is and
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.360]   where it is? Right? No. He'd be like, you want to be on my show?
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.400]   And by the way, he doesn't want me on a show. I've asked him. He said, no,
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.320]   that's the highest level, right? That's the top of the food chain.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.360]   The lowest end is a podcast you've never heard of. That's like just starting.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.240]   And they are going to inundate you with facts and figures and information and
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.840]   pretty pleased. And these are the people I worked with.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.200]   And like, let me prove myself to you with words. Okay.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.600]   And so you're about a third too long in that.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.240]   Okay.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.280]   Because these people are peers, your show kicks ass.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.400]   And that outreach from you should be
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.880]   less. It's Hey, I got a podcast. I think you're cool.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.240]   I've heard you on other stuff. I'd like you to be a guest. Let's connect.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.560]   When you're a new brand and people probably don't know you, Joe Rogan,
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.920]   people know him, right? So he sends a message. Everyone knows him.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.960]   You want to come across like you're not desperate,
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.000]   but you also need some validation. Is it just limit the validation?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.200]   Yes. It's limit the validation.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.440]   Because if you, if it comes across as you pitching or selling, you're dead.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.040]   It's over. So what would you rather have someone who's kind of curious?
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.360]   Cause you didn't give them everything to figure out or someone who's just like
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.720]   this guy, you know, women, money, people,
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.680]   they move away from things that chase it. And so if you sell,
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.840]   if you're pushing, if you're trying to convince,
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.480]   if you're trying to influence people are repulsed by that,
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.800]   they are repelled to go the other direction.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.320]   Now sometimes what you have is so much value that you overcome that,
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.520]   but that is not where you want to be. And if you're saying, Hey,
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.000]   I want you to be on my podcast.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.120]   There's only a couple of things that make sense to talk to somebody about what
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.320]   does your podcast focus on? Is it a podcast about gyms?
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.080]   Is it a podcast about airline flights? Is it oil exploration?
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.720]   Like you got to explain that, Hey, I do this podcast. It's called this,
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.680]   it does this, right?
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.560]   If you have some credibility on the size and the scope and the people you've had
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.400]   is reasonable, but unfortunately, everybody's going to say that, right?
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:18.280]   Everybody's going to say it's the number one podcast in this category, right?
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.000]   Or it's got 90,000 unique views or
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.720]   something, something, something, right?
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:29.960]   So that you just got to keep to a minimum and that's what you do.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.560]   If you were the number one podcast in the world, but no one knew you,
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.920]   I guess you'd say it's the number one podcast in the world.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.800]   Not like it's the number one podcast rule,
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.280]   according to these things on this date by this measure.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.320]   And you can verify it here.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.400]   Here's the link to see whether I'm the number one.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.120]   And like I've attached the certificate of my number one authenticity.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.800]   You wouldn't do that. And the irony, if you did, I'd be like, Hmm,
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.480]   this probably isn't real. Right.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.000]   And the more things you included to explain and validate it,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.200]   the less I believe it. That's the irony of it. It's like,
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.320]   the more you prove it, the less I want to accept it. Even if it's like, Oh, okay.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.040]   So your thing is you have great guests,
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.720]   present company excluded. You have good numbers.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.120]   It's a great show with a great unique hook.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.880]   If you're reaching out for people to be as a guest,
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.400]   that's all you really need to say from your perspective. Right.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.960]   Or the other way is like,
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.880]   imagine if you wanted to get my 16 year old son as a guest, you'd be like, Hey,
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.720]   man, I got a podcast. It does this. Want to be a guest. Okay.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.080]   So there's the two extremes, right? My son's nobody.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.520]   He would die to be on anybody's podcast. Joe Rogan is the greatest podcast.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.120]   Everybody wants to be on it. Those two things in those two situations,
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.200]   you pitch them exactly the same, very few words,
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.400]   almost understanding that you're going to want it.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.360]   And if you want to get more details like when, how, why, all that kind of stuff.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.640]   Great. And that's normally what you'll end up getting shorter.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.720]   That is sort of that outreach. The more responses you'll get asking for things.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.360]   Do I need to do this? When I do that, how do you do this?
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.480]   So what reached you have, you know,
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.960]   one thing that this just made me think about in a previous life,
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.880]   I was a founder of a tech company that raised money. Right.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.800]   And I found that one of the most effective things was to give everyone a really
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.240]   easy out. So I know you have a different thought on closing that a lot,
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.600]   but I would be trying to raise money.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.240]   And I'd send an email follow up two days later and say, Hey,
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.120]   just want to follow up and see if you need any more info. If not, no worries.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.280]   Catch you next time.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.000]   Give them this easy out because a lot of people struggle with the no.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.960]   And then you have the anxiety of them. Oh, are they going to say yes?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.160]   What do they say? If you just make it so easy for someone to say no,
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.400]   they just give you the answer faster.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.640]   Yeah. And that's part of it, right? Like you just want to make it clear.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.080]   If what you were offering had real value, you wouldn't desperately need them.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.120]   And if they didn't see the value, you wouldn't be like,
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:46.960]   I need to convert your no, I need to overcome the pushback. It's like,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.320]   what? It's like, no, you got other people to go deal with people who will see the
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.440]   value. That person doesn't see the value. Like a buh-bye.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.600]   That has to be what you convey in the words.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.520]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.960]   But the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.080]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.160]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.880]   And I am excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.480]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.440]   And I've kept it in my daily routine for months. Every morning,
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.320]   I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.160]   It tastes so good when it's cold.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.800]   And I head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day,
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.160]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.960]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins,
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.840]   minerals and superfoods and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.000]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.160]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.640]   Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune supporting
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.440]   Being a parent can be scary, whether it's watching your toddler,
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.160]   jump on your new couch naked during potty training,
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.920]   or the indescribable pain of stepping on tiny plastic dinosaurs in your bare
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.720]   feet. Both of which happened to me recently. Well,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.480]   one thing that doesn't have to be scary is getting life insurance,

[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.280]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.120]   not available in certain States.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.760]   Price is subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.640]   In an in-person pitch,
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:34.080]   you had a perspective that I thought was maybe one of the most unique I've seen
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.600]   and something that makes me want to go do an in-person pitch,
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.720]   which is on how you shouldn't actually wrap up.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.960]   Yeah. I always been cringy about that kind of stuff.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.280]   Cause a lot of people want to wrap up their pitch with like a fancy phrase or
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.640]   a saying. Think about when you watch shark tank and it's like, Hey sharks,
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.120]   who wants to dive in here with me and swim? Whatever. You're like, Oh, it's like,
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.040]   Oh yeah, you're pitching this. Oh yeah. You've rehearsed this. Oh yeah.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.760]   This is your stick. You basically took them out of that moment of,
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.440]   I'm listening to your story to be like, Oh, sorry.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.880]   We're pausing it for commercial break. Effectively. It lets the room down.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.680]   I've never found a closing that makes people stand up and clap other than
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.480]   that's it. Thanks. Kind of thing. And that's my idea. Welcome to this,
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.240]   whatever that last piece is, which is like, I'm done. I've explained it to you.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.000]   We're talking or I'm leaving. That's the vibe.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.840]   If they have more they need from you, they will ask.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.000]   And that is a classic Hollywood ending.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.640]   There was a guy who ran CBS and he's famous for the most deadpan looks,
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.080]   no emotion. You didn't know what was going to happen. You left that room.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.920]   You weren't sure if he loved it, hate it. It didn't matter. That was he trained.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.760]   And the irony was the people who worked after him, that he worked for him.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.480]   They learned how to do that too. And if it didn't go well,
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.440]   if the pitch didn't go well, again, would simply say, great. I got it. Thanks.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.880]   And that was it. Nothing else. So you're like, okay.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.480]   And then if you'd ask a question,
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   how are you going to deal with this in the third act? You'd be like, Oh shit.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.960]   Like he's got, he's interested. And then you would engage.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:07.440]   And that's the vibe that is hard to let people capture on their own.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.120]   You've got to find out what your audience thinks. You can't push them.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.160]   You got to give them the basics. Then you'll know,
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.160]   is this something in your wheelhouse or not?
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:23.280]   And the amount of people that you can convert from an objection and the amount
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.160]   of work takes and the amount of lasting sort of good that's created,
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.240]   that is so small in today's world. It's not worth it.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.720]   So instead of objection handling, which I know they teach in sales,
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.080]   it's just move on.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.600]   It's better to go try again than to try to overcome every objection.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.040]   It's not even close. It's not even close.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.240]   An objection is somebody that basically has said, I don't buy into this.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.440]   Now it's different if they don't understand it.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:53.040]   And a lot of times what I'm dealing with is I'm dealing with companies who are
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.760]   trying to get through objections by giving the audience the information they
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.440]   should have given them in the beginning.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.600]   And so they're trying to handle objections and they're actually using the
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.640]   information they should have used in the beginning as like, Oh no, no, no,
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.880]   that's not what it means. Or, Oh no, we can do this twice for you.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.280]   Or whatever it is. Whereas when we retrain and go through it again, it's like,
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.200]   Hey, here's all the objections laid out.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.480]   And if you're talking about objections like, Hey,
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.600]   I need to talk to my wife cause I'm not sure we can afford it.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.240]   And your job is to close them. A, that's not my world.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.480]   I don't work with that kind of piece. That's not what I do.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.080]   And I've been approached by a lot of companies that have that type of sales
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:29.320]   stuff.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.600]   And I worked with a very large company on their timeshare business.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:39.160]   I just couldn't get them to really make the big enough changes
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.800]   because they're just a slow moving thing.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.320]   And their goal is to get people in an emotional state and trick them into
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.000]   signing. Yeah, that's not what I do. The timeshare is good for certain group,
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.320]   a certain demographic. This actually works really well for.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.880]   So why don't we just tell people how it works really, really well.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.240]   And if they fit into the demographic, they'll let you know. And they're just like,
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:01.280]   what? That's not how we, that's not how we do things. We force them into it.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.720]   We make them feel guilty. Like every trick in the book. It's not my world.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.680]   I've gone to the timeshare pitches mostly out of curiosity to see how they do it.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.560]   I have yet to ever say yes.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.280]   But one thing that I've tried in the past,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.480]   I'm curious if you've seen this or used it when it comes to objections.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.720]   I knew when I was raising money for my last company,
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.360]   I knew that if someone wanted a lot of information
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.600]   about customer acquisition, like we just hadn't done it.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.360]   And I knew that it was like the most common objection.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.840]   And I would just start the pitch. I would walk in a bag.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.640]   After I explained what the company did, I would say, Hey, I just want to pause.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.480]   We don't have customer acquisition data yet.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.000]   We have not gone through that part of the business.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.680]   If that is something you guys need to see, we can just stop right now.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.640]   We don't need to keep going. Right.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.240]   And a part of that was I wanted them to get over it because they've already
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.000]   blocked off 30 minutes. They want to see the rest.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.760]   It's not necessarily going to work,
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.720]   but at least makes them less focused on this thing that they might say no to.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.680]   It's genius. It's owning the negative.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.400]   And that's a big piece of storytelling is people get sucked
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.440]   into the idea that what's negative about their pitch or what the downside is.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.920]   I just start every development meeting when we're talking about television shows.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.560]   Why is a network going to pass on this show? Tell me why. What is the reason?
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.080]   It doesn't fit with the brand. It's too hard to produce.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.440]   We can't cast it properly. I don't think people are going to like it.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.880]   It's not going to be relatable. Okay. If I can't get past that in this room,
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.040]   the network's never going to get and like never going to get past that.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.560]   If you pretend you don't know what the negative side is,
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.960]   there's not a lot of good options. One is your audience never brings it up.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.480]   And so they just think that you either too dumb or you're hiding it from them.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.080]   Number two is they bring it up right there.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.840]   And now you've got to scramble and answer it.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.120]   So if you end up not mentioning it and they bring it up,
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.760]   you can answer it except for they've been thinking about it.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.760]   The entire time that's what they've been doing. They've been talking about it.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.960]   And that is a disaster. You cannot have them doing that.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.320]   And so the last option is you bring it up because it's not going to be,
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.760]   they didn't figure it out. They didn't understand what could be wrong here.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.040]   That's never going to happen.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.880]   So the negative is important.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.000]   How big it is and how much importance it has is all directly proportionate to
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.880]   where you put it in the pitch. And by you talking about it right in front,
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.560]   saying, Hey, we don't customer acquisition data.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.040]   So if that's an important thing, like, just know we don't do that.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.720]   We haven't done that yet. It's like, okay, that's done.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.040]   When we end up having storytelling in Hollywood,
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.760]   you don't get in a moment where it's like the Shawshank Redemption, uh,
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   Andy Dufresne looks, you know, you get beaten up,
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.760]   but he looks like he's going to die. And you're not like, Oh, what a wimp.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.120]   I hate him. It's over. He's a loser. Right. Rocky gets knocked down.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.800]   You're like, Oh, that's it. This movie sucks. He's a bum.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:42.640]   All is lost is the setup for here's what's great.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.360]   That is the best part of it, right?
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.080]   When you talk about not having customer acquisition,
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:51.120]   and then you explain everything, your audience is then going to be like, Ooh,
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.080]   like, I wonder how this customer acquisition could work.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.000]   And they'll start overlaying their own excitement to get to the result they want.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.240]   The negative can never hurt you. Never hurt you in a pitch.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.280]   So you mentioned a lot of storytelling in that response,
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.600]   but I noticed that when you gave your example of your buddy, Jeff,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.240]   there wasn't really any storytelling.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.400]   Is it that storytelling maybe doesn't need to be part of the first three minutes
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.520]   with the whack part?
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.040]   No, it's that people look at storytelling as once upon a time,
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.640]   I was here and that's not what storytelling is. That's wordsmith.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:26.320]   That is wordplay. Storytelling is here's the situation.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.680]   Here's what's happening. Here's what's going to happen next. Here's why.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.360]   Scripts are storytelling because they fill themselves with words and they flow to
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.200]   the points.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.960]   The points are the elements of a story that lead you to the next piece.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.200]   How many people are listening that have a favorite movie and they watch it and
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.520]   they know what happens and they still like it.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.600]   It's not because it's so cleverly written.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.640]   You follow the story beat by beat by
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.480]   beat. And that's what makes it interesting. And that's what makes it fun.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.560]   And that's what leads you. So when I talk about storytelling,
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.000]   I'm not telling people how to tell the story of how they came to be in this
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.720]   piece and why this is going to work for someone. I see a lot of that.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.240]   It's a terrible idea because nobody wants your story to be wordsmith for them.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.240]   They want to get to the point. If I'm there to be entertained. Okay. Wordsmith.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.720]   Make it fun. But if I want something from you or you want something for me,
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.360]   can we just get to the point? Here's what it is.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.800]   I want to know how it works. Then once you understand,
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.120]   you want to know could that be real? Would that actually do what you think it is?
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.000]   Oh yeah. Okay. How do I get that? That's what a story builds.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.840]   That's how storytelling in Hollywood works.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.800]   You inform people and lead them to the conclusion.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   That's all Hollywood storytelling is,
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.920]   is leading people to the conclusion you want. The boat sinks in Titanic.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.920]   You watch the film, Andy Dufresne.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.560]   You want him to escape from the prison at Shawshank. You want it to happen.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:57.440]   We don't start that movie by saying, Andy Dufresne escapes from a very bad prison.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.960]   Let me tell you why he does that. That's not how you tell a story.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.480]   Tell a story and be like, here's where he's at in this story. Here's what he did.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   Here's why he's in the prison. Here are the conditions. Here's his choices.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.960]   It looks like he's not going to make it. Then you're like, please escape. Right?
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.160]   That's how a story is told.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.800]   Is there an example of that kind of storytelling with a pitch for a product or
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.640]   a service?
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.920]   Well, yes.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.280]   The way that I use that in a classic storytelling with wordsmithing sort of
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.400]   idea is in what's called the intro with my reason for being.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.000]   That's the only time where that makes sense,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.360]   where you want to explain to people the reason why they are there.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.120]   You are there. We are here. How did this come to be?
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.640]   I started developing that technique when we were doing pilots and presentations
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.280]   for the networks.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.960]   And sometimes you'd send it in and they would take this DVD,
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.760]   put it in the DVD player.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.240]   They'd watch your pilot and then they decide if they're going to buy it or not.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.200]   I just couldn't live with that because there was things I wanted them to know
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.840]   about it and things that happened along the way.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.440]   So I became very,
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.440]   very good at warming the room and creating the anticipation.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.880]   And if I knew something might be an issue,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.280]   I would be calling the head of the network. I'm saying, Hey, by the way,
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.320]   I feel like our second act is really shallow here because I didn't have this
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.560]   scene. I wanted to film it. So I feel like that second act drags a lot. Right.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.560]   And they're like, okay, so now they're anticipating.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.560]   So it can drag and it doesn't kill it. I would say like, Hey,
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.960]   I would have added this longer because I love this scene so much,
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.040]   but I know that your delivery, we need nine minutes of this act.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.000]   There is so much here that blank, blank, blank. I set that room tone.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   So when they put the DVD in, they know exactly what to think,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.840]   exactly how to feel exactly what went into this,
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.360]   and they can judge it on its merits. Your pitch is kind of the same.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.400]   How did you get here?
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.760]   How is your reason for being about why this product or service is interesting?
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.840]   How does that translate to why you're sitting there?
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.040]   And I'll give you a great example.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.720]   One of my favorites from one of my favorite companies I've ever worked with is
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.960]   a electric vehicle controller manufacturer called XROW Technologies.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.560]   And they had come to me, the chairman had come to me a while ago and said, Hey,
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.080]   will you come on board? We really need some help. And I looked at the company.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:11.320]   I was like, nah, too small Canadian, small, micro cab company,
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.320]   not my world. I really liked this guy, but not going to happen.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.480]   He called me back three months later and he said, Hey, listen,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.040]   we just hired a new CEO taking over.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.120]   She's moving to Calgary to head office to start this up.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.600]   She would really use some help. And I think you guys would hit it off.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.520]   And I was like, nah. And he said,
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:32.080]   she's the CEO of GE small industrial motors and she's leaving that
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.760]   gig. And I could not get my brain around why she would do that.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   And so when I talked to her on the phone, I said, I'd talk to her and I asked her,
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.120]   I said, why would you take this job?
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.200]   Why would you leave one of the highest profile jobs in that business and move
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.080]   your entire family to Calgary, Alberta for this micro cap,
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.280]   infinitesimally small company? Why would you do that? And she said, Oh, well,
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.840]   do you know anything about electric motors? And I said, well, like, no,
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.800]   not really. And she goes, well, I do.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.400]   And I've been looking for this technology since I was 12 years old,
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.920]   winding electric motors in my family's electric motor shop.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.400]   I know what this technology can do. I could not resist.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:17.000]   So when she would pitch that story, that was the reason for me.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.800]   Now you don't know anything about that company,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.600]   but I guarantee everybody listening now wants to know what that technology is.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.080]   I've set up that. And so when she pitches, so she would say,
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.320]   I was CEO of GE small industrial motors. I got a call from this company.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.480]   I ignored them for many time until I finally said one phrase that changed my
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.680]   life. I said, show me the technology. And they did.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.320]   And 30 days later,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.240]   I attended my resignation at GE and moved my entire family to Calgary,
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.600]   Alberta to take over as the CEO of Xtro Technologies.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.080]   And now you're like, okay, then that's the start of the pitch.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.480]   That's the story that leads you to be like,
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.200]   so let me tell you a little bit about Xtro.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.480]   We are a technology company that makes controllers for electric vehicles.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:07.760]   We use coil switching the dynamic way to be the brains behind the way electric
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.680]   vehicle performs with our coil switching technology.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:15.120]   You can go farther and go faster on the same charge.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.240]   And you're like, what? And then it's like,
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.520]   let me tell you the details of the technology. And then she gets into it.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.600]   The power of that story in the beginning to set up that thing is very hard to
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.840]   ignore. That's how you lead somebody to that piece. It's not always like that.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.000]   Sometimes you got to send a deck.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.240]   Sometimes people don't want to hear your little small talk in the beginning.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.600]   They just want you to play it. But that's where classic,
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:43.440]   let me tell you a story fits in is it should be the story of how you got there or
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.760]   why this counts. And is that the first part of every pitch?
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.200]   Almost every pitch has that because 90 times out of a hundred,
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.240]   you're going to have a conversation to begin to pitch.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.920]   Sometimes you're just sending a deck or an email.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.200]   You're not going to be able to do that, but it becomes a, how did you get there?
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.040]   Why is this interesting? What compelled you to be there?
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.880]   Like the one I wrote in the book, this woman show jumped with her horse.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.960]   She had an axle problem on the way to the event.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.600]   She on the side of the road,
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.520]   the horses were freaking out and it was nine 30 at night.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.960]   Where do you put your horse? She's like, Oh my God.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.640]   And yet you could see in the area,
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.120]   there's gotta be houses everywhere that have barns and
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.520]   stables, but no way to access them. I don't know what to know.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.360]   And then he's closed.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.400]   She realized that's when she came up with bed and bale, which is Airbnb,
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:36.720]   but for horses. Now, do you need a lot more? Like if you were an investor,
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.120]   now your questions are not like, Oh, what is this thing?
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:44.560]   How does this app work? Or what's the driving force? It's like, okay,
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.400]   where are you? Like, do you build the app? Like now you're engaged already.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.240]   Cause you get it.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:54.800]   Understanding is the fundamental importance for being
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.880]   engaged. People who don't understand something can't engage with you.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.000]   But if it's Airbnb for horses, people travel with horses,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.960]   they need a place to put them. There's houses all over America with barns.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.800]   Unused. Yeah, I get it. But I want to know this, this, this, this, this, this,
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.200]   this, this, this, this, this, right. Yeah. And that's really the key.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:17.240]   Getting the crew together. Isn't as easy as it used to be. I get it.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.000]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.800]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.880]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.840]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor drizzly,
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.280]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.360]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.240]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.640]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out,
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.600]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week with
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.800]   drizzly. You can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.840]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.560]   leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.880]   drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of beer, wine,
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.880]   and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:06.240]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.560]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.920]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.920]   So whatever the occasion download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:23.920]   That's D R I Z L Y.com today must be 21
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.200]   plus not available in all locations.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:31.480]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.200]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs,
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.000]   codes, deals, and discounts from our partners.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.280]   You can go to all the hacks.com/deals.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.640]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.160]   One thing you mentioned is, okay, so maybe if you have to send a deck,
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.560]   the intro isn't part of it.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.880]   There are a lot of times where I've met people who are like, well,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.200]   if someone tells me to send a deck,
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:58.240]   I try to force them into having the conversation in person.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.160]   Do you think you should, as a business or a person selling anything,
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.200]   kind of hone all the mediums or try to...
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.440]   Unfortunately, yeah, because it's just like,
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.440]   you try to push somebody to do an in-person meeting.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.480]   If you can get that to happen, great.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.560]   But if your deck or your written material can't stand on their own,
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.920]   you're buggered because if you think that person that you're pitching,
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.040]   it makes the ultimate decision and isn't going to share it with someone else.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.600]   It doesn't have to do that. That's never going to work.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.080]   What's happening is we live in a sort of decision by committee world.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.960]   They have to rationalize why they liked it to somebody.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.400]   And that means they're going to have to share your deck with them and they're
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.400]   going to have to summarize your pitch.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.960]   But if I told you and I sent you the deck for bed and bail,
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.280]   and I told you to go explain it to somebody, you'd say Airbnb for horses.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.200]   It's because I already gave you that.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.400]   And so now the summary, it lives on its own.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:53.200]   And the deck kind of reinforces that. In her opening of that deck,
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.440]   it's occasionally there'll be something of a story that led her there.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.880]   But all I really needed from that story to get across to people is that there's
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.240]   nowhere for people who travel with horses to put them other than a
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.080]   professional kennel. And those places close.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.200]   It's not like a hotel where they're open for reservations all the time.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.280]   It's stables. Those people go home. So that's really all I needed to convey.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.880]   That's the setup, right? Is it the problem?
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.000]   Sometimes it's the problem that you answer.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.160]   I find people get too detailed into that,
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:28.200]   but really the part of the deck that makes the most impact
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.760]   is what is it? That's it.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.600]   That's what it is. Airbnb for horses.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.440]   The phrasing around that makes people go first page, second page. Now they're,
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.080]   like, okay, I'm going to read this. Cause I want to find things out.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.200]   Not I'm reading it. It's four pages. I don't really understand how many people
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.280]   listening have done that,
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.440]   where they get a deck and they're looking through and they're like reading it.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.600]   And they're like, I don't really get it.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.400]   And so their first question is I don't really understand how this works.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.680]   I don't really understand how that works. And you're like, oh no,
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.480]   that was like page four. And the thing that happens to people all the time,
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.720]   or you're pitching it. And someone says to you, they ask a question. You're like,
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.360]   oh yeah, I'm getting to that in just a second here.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.160]   That's a pretty good sign.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.240]   You've got your information in the wrong order because people are already having
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:11.880]   thoughts.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:16.000]   Are there other signs or ways to evaluate how you're doing with whatever kind of
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.640]   pitch you have, whether it's for business or something at work?
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.560]   It's hard because the engagement doesn't give you what you need.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.720]   People pretend to be interested. They pretend to be disinterested.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.960]   It's really about what they engage with next. Do they ask questions?
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.160]   Are the questions about what you're doing and the concept,
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.560]   then you've got a problem. If the questions are like,
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   what are you doing next? How do you solve this problem? Where does this go?
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.960]   How do we deal with this? Is there a way this happens?
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.960]   And there are those kinds of questions. They understand the concept.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.560]   And if you can't get that square,
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.960]   then you will see people's reaction.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.920]   It'll mostly be in the questions they ask, kind of tell you how you're doing.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.720]   How do you feel about rehearsing?
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.000]   Should people be practicing this a lot and with who?
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.800]   I do think you should practice a lot with anybody.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:07.480]   The key is you should be able to say it to anybody
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:13.200]   at any time. You should have those 4 sentences pretty locked down.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.800]   And what you'll find is then you can start to color them and add to them and
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.040]   make them better. And you can gauge the people that you're talking to.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.400]   If my buddy Jeff is talking about his personal training business,
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.000]   and he's talking to another personal trainer,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.520]   he would pitch what he does a little differently,
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.200]   but he already has the language in his repertoire. He might start with, yeah.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   Oh, I'm personally, I do this. I do that. Like his basics are already there.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.560]   The framework structure is already there. It's good to rehearse,
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.280]   but have you ever heard somebody that you know,
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.320]   they're reading or, you know, they've memorized it, it just detracts.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.160]   Cause then you're like, Oh, right. This is rehearsed.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.880]   And it sucks the passion out of it.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.640]   And it just makes it look like you're trying too hard.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.800]   And that's just like in a romantic relationship,
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.720]   like somebody is trying too hard. It's just not interested.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.560]   My guidance has always been rehearsed as much as you need so that you don't need
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.360]   notes. That's part one.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.920]   But then part two is and get really comfortable with the fact that there's going
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.920]   to be multiple things you forget and it's okay. Yeah.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.960]   Because if you rehearse it all and then you forget something,
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.680]   you get caught up and you're like, Oh, there was one,
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.320]   a fourth point and let me go back and look.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.320]   And I think it's better if you just roll with the three and forget the fourth
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.560]   point. And if it's important,
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.520]   it'll probably come back later because you don't want to be searching for notes
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.960]   in the middle of the conversation. Yeah. You talked about slides.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.640]   When people are giving presentations,
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.720]   you want the slides to live on their own because you mentioned they might get
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.440]   shared around,
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.080]   but you also don't want them to be distracting when you're talking.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.240]   Do you tell people to create two different presentations?
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.800]   Yes. A hundred percent. Okay. Yeah. Almost always. I mean,
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.200]   think about it. You're giving a presentation with slides.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.880]   What do you actually want them to do? The person,
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.480]   do you want them to read the slide,
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.120]   the words on there and read the information? Then what are you doing there?
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.480]   But then they're reading it. And if you don't want them to read it,
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.280]   then why have it? Unless it's just a picture, you're describing it.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.280]   So there are your two things. You want them to read it or you don't.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.480]   If you don't want them to read it,
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.760]   then it better be something that accentuates what you're saying. Bullet points,
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.240]   pictures, simple messages, like that simple.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.360]   If you're put up something enough that they have to read,
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.240]   there's no point in having it there. Because if you're talking,
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.440]   they're not going to know what are they trying to split time on reading it,
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.680]   doing jumping ahead. It's just, it's a disaster.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.200]   People want to put slides so it looks like they've done a lot of work.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.960]   It's like, okay, by the way, I'm not even against that. Sometimes,
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.880]   sometimes there's graphs and charts that look good.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.040]   So you put it on a slide and when you're presenting in person,
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.920]   but you're not speaking to the numbers on there. You're saying,
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.520]   we did extensive research and I will send you this in detail.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.640]   So you can read what this slide says, but here's the summary,
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:54.520]   as opposed to here's the market research response. As you could see here,
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.840]   it's like your slides should accentuate what you're saying,
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.680]   not trying to do the work for you.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.560]   One other thing that I'll share just in case anyone's making a presentation,
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.000]   you could tell me if you don't like this idea,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.800]   but every time I went and gave a pitch for my company,
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.000]   I took notes after the fact of all the questions I was getting asked.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.360]   And then I took every question and I said, okay,
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.760]   this question is either going to be a question that I think everyone needs the
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.880]   answer to. It needs to be part of the pitch.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.480]   Or it's a question that some people might have, but not everyone.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.600]   So it's not as part of the pitch,
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.280]   but I'm going to create a slide for the question. And it was basically,
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.560]   I don't know if this was like a psychological trick,
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.840]   but I found that someone would ask a question at the end and I would jump to a
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.080]   slide to answer it the first time I wouldn't. And then I'd go home,
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.080]   I'd make the slide. And the next time I would jump to it.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.240]   And for some reason when it was written on the slide,
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.880]   as if I thought about it in advance, people were like, Oh, you can answer this.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.280]   I'm not worried anymore. But if I off the cuff answer it, I'm just like, Oh,
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.520]   this is what we're going to do. People were a little more apprehensive.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.680]   Exactly. It's like what I used to say when I was pitching TV,
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.600]   it's all in the casting. I was like, no, it's in the concept.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.600]   If I have to tell you that we'll figure it out in casting,
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.280]   it means I really don't know how to make it work.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.280]   And I'll just get good cast that'll fix it.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.160]   And that's the same thing where you asked me a question that's even tough.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:11.880]   And I just answer it. There's a chance that I may not believe you,
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.360]   that I think you just will say anything to make the pitch good.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:19.640]   Any final tips for people obviously not pitching Hollywood and that kind of
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.480]   thing that you left off?
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:24.560]   It's anything. It is literally a guide for conversation in life.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.360]   Keep it simple.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.240]   Probably the best exercise that seemed to work the best for people is I have them
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.560]   do my Twitter exercise.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:37.240]   You had to tweet what your product or service was and that's it.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:42.880]   And not the new extended Twitter length, but the original 144 characters,
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.360]   what would you put, what would you say?
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.680]   And if you can't get it there because you think everything is so valuable and so
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.040]   complicated, you need to work harder.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.680]   It means that you're actually in more need of it. And it's just happened to me.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:00.120]   I have a very big client. I'm very excited about their company.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.880]   I've come on as an advisor. I'm really involved.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.760]   It is a very in-depth company.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.360]   There are layers on layers and we are talking about it and I couldn't get a log
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.880]   line for them because there was just so many things. Oh,
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.880]   but we don't talk about the financing. Then we don't do that.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.440]   When we finally got it, it was like, Oh wow.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.600]   It was more important than we thought because at the beginning, you're like, Oh,
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.280]   we got so many good things. Let's just get people in a little bit.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.200]   And then they'll see all the good things. And you're like, no,
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.840]   go to the Twitter thing. And can you make it that simple?
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.960]   Sometimes with clients I'll be like, okay, here's seven words.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.560]   Tell me your idea in seven words. That's it.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:39.360]   Which seven do you choose? Platform,
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:44.400]   used for hailing, whatever.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.040]   You have to put it in such a small thing. You're like, okay,
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.360]   if I do that TV shows, we used to do it all the time.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:54.240]   It's the amazing race for the smartest people in the world.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:57.920]   I don't really know the show, but you could get a basic idea. It's like, okay.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.560]   Then you add, all right, here's 10 more words. Go ahead.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.800]   What would you choose? And then you're adding.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.920]   And that's probably the best exercise,
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:11.280]   which is could you actually explain it in 144 characters if you really had to?
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:14.240]   So people don't necessarily want to buy it,
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.840]   but they don't understand what it is you sell.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.760]   That's basically trying to convey the four points of the whack weather or just
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.480]   the first.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.600]   If you only have 144 characters or 15 or 25 words, just the first,
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.760]   it is the most important. What is it is the most important.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.320]   How does it work is the second.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.080]   Those take up 50% of everything that you need.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.240]   All right. And everything else people will get to.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.800]   They can't get to those two things on their own.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.520]   It's the only two things they can't get to on their own.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.640]   They need you to inform them. Everything else,
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.040]   they can start to put together themselves. They can have an idea,
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.480]   they can develop it, but until they understand what it is and how it works,
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.720]   you got nothing.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.400]   If they can come to their own conclusions for the second half of your pitch,
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.840]   at least at those steps,
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:00.160]   how much of your pitch is planned in advance versus free form based on the
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.800]   questions people are asking and where it's going.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:05.880]   I still have pretty good structure just because they come to the conclusion.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:10.520]   They may miss things because they're focused in one
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.640]   area, which is fine. You want all the details laid out the rest.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.280]   After the three minutes, you can have very loose,
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.800]   very loose because they're already interested. They want to engage.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:26.840]   They are looking for confirmation of their predetermined bias already.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.640]   That's what they're looking for now. Oh, I like that idea.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:34.240]   But do you have a patent? Do you do this?
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:38.200]   That's what you want. You want them to be like, Ooh, this could be good.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:43.160]   But is that a good valuation? But how far are you from revenue? You want that.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.600]   You don't get that you are fighting uphill.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.960]   I feel like I have a lot of notes.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.240]   I'm going to work on my pitch that I send out to other guests like you,
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.920]   all kinds of people. I want to take a quick turn.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:59.320]   So we talk a lot about travel on this show and hack it up,
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.880]   hack it up last year. You sold your house. You bought a fancy RV.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.120]   You went around the country,
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:09.680]   hit all 48 contiguous States in six months with your wife and your two kids.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.200]   Before I hear more, would you do that again?
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.240]   I would be on the road right now if it wasn't for my youngest,
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:20.480]   wanting to go back to real school. So I loved it. I loved every second of it.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.240]   I mean, I'm, I'm in a semi-retirement mode anyways.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.960]   I didn't know America was, I didn't know it was that good.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:31.480]   That was the one takeaway from seeing all 48 States interacted with people every
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.080]   single day. It was part of the documentary that I was making about.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.560]   It was like, we got to go meet people. We got to go see people.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.120]   We was called dinner with America.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:42.400]   We went and just random people we met and just heard their stories.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.560]   And it's just shocked at how great this country is. The people,
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.000]   I know it feels like we're tearing each other apart and there's such divide,
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.560]   except it's not really like that. It really isn't. It's like that in the media.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.040]   It's like that on your social media feed.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:59.240]   It's like that in a few cities at certain times and it's a protest,
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.920]   but for the most part,
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:05.280]   the things that humans and Americans have in common so outweigh the things we
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:08.520]   don't that in the real world, people are just doing their thing.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.280]   They're trying to have fun. They're trying to take care of their family.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.560]   They're trying to make a better life. People are really, really great.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:13.680]   And so I absolutely loved it.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:18.360]   And I went from a relatively good size house here in Los Angeles to
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.880]   a trailer for six months. That was smaller than my bathroom.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.960]   So it took some getting used to, but I loved it.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.680]   Any places you went that were kind of unusual and you're like,
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.120]   I didn't think that this would be a place I'd love.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:35.840]   Yeah. Oh yeah. I'd say big surprises for us were Alabama region,
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:40.800]   like Alabama, Tennessee, that area, Oklahoma, Arkansas.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.200]   It was just amazing. We had such a great time. People were amazing.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.280]   Love the scenery, that kind of stuff. That was a surprise.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.680]   And the other sort of big one for me was like Niagara falls.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:53.920]   Like Niagara falls was really fun. And like a great, great day.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:58.720]   That was a surprise because I expected to be very touristy and, and it was,
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.040]   it just didn't matter because it was awesome.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:04.280]   But I found that Southern hospitality and that kind of
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.880]   vibe, South Carolina and all that was just like,
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.680]   it was so heartwarming and the people were amazing. And we just fell in love.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.280]   How did you meet all these people?
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.640]   I think everyone I know when they're traveling loves to have the story of, Oh,
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.400]   you met some locals in this place. You said you did it every day,
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.720]   every single day. How did you make that happen?
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.800]   Every day we had a few things we had to try to, you know,
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.320]   what the place was famous for foods.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.640]   We had to find the restaurant that sort of represented that best restaurant,
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.600]   the city kind of idea.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.520]   We had to find out what the cool adventure was whitewater rafting or downhill
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.640]   mountain biking or whatever a cool adventure was and what the great site would
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:37.640]   be. What do you have to go see?
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.000]   Do we got to go see the St. Louis arch like that kind of stuff, you know?
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.160]   So we did a lot of the touristy things that you have to see if you've never been
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.440]   to St. Louis, you kind of got to see the arch, that kind of stuff.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.880]   You're going to rock and roll hall of fame. So we did all those,
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.200]   but then while we were out doing that,
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:54.000]   our goal was to find someone to interact with and be like, Hey,
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.040]   can we take you to dinner? This is what we're doing.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.240]   And it was all the time, every time, every place. It happened.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.080]   That's just what we did. It was amazing.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.400]   I'll give you a great example. My kids were pulling into Kentucky,
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:11.080]   big Kentucky horse park, RV place, huge place, big round.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.920]   And you can park on the inside or you can park on the outside.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.560]   The outside has these amazing views of the vistas. We felt we were driving around.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.880]   We found the one, you pick whatever one you want.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.720]   This is beautiful backed right onto a park, basically a park.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.760]   We could drop our door out the back of the deck. It would be amazing.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:31.320]   But on the inside was about six RVs that were clustered together and everybody
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.480]   in their middle sort of like fire going, chatting. Right.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.280]   And then we drove around and I said to the kids, all right, what should we do?
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.200]   We should take this spot. Super beautiful.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.160]   We'll be able to back right on the park. It'll be amazing.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.880]   Or do you guys want to back into this group of people and just join in?
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:49.400]   And my kids were like 17 and 15. We're like, yeah, let's go with the people.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:53.120]   And so we backed our RV into a site that sort of backed into them.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.560]   We got everything all set up and we literally walked right over their campsite.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.440]   It was like, Hey, where are you guys from? That was it.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.640]   We're playing volleyball with them all night. We're making dinner.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.560]   Like that was it in Washington state.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:05.920]   We're riding our electric bikes.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.680]   And this guy had this recumbent bike or the one that you sit on and you pedal
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.320]   with your hands or whatever. And he's flying.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.880]   We get to the stoplight place waiting for the light to change.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:16.480]   And I looked down and that's not a recumbent bike. He has got no legs, no legs.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:20.000]   And I looked at him and I just made the joke. I was like, Oh man,
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:20.840]   you're making me look bad.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.440]   I'm on an electric bike here and you don't even have leg. Like this is,
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.880]   you make me look at we're laughing and the kids. And now what's your name?
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.640]   He's like, Louise. And I was like, what are you doing tonight? Louise?
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:33.520]   He's like, why do you ask? Hey, we do this thing. You want to come to dinner?
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.920]   Come down to the campsite. We'll make dinner for you. He's like, okay.
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.360]   So he came down.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:42.120]   So we spent the night with him and we met people from all four corners of the
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:44.600]   country. Every race, creed, religion. It was amazing.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:46.240]   It was the greatest experience of my life.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:48.760]   Best thing my kids ever I've ever done for them.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.840]   That's amazing. Had you traveled a lot with your kids before?
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:56.640]   We do a lot of adventures. Like I run an adventure club nonprofit for exactly.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.800]   So I do a lot of adventure stuff.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:02.160]   So the kids are not unused to doing weird kooky things like my daughter and I
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:06.640]   rappel down waterfalls, like silly things like that, but we're not campers.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.840]   We're not RV people. That's just not our world.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.960]   So this was all sort of new in that sense.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.840]   And we never been away for longer than a week or two ever.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.040]   That's amazing. Are the lists of all the,
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.600]   we had to find the best place here and do this thing.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.640]   Is that published anywhere? I got all that. I got, I have all that.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.240]   I haven't published it all yet. I'm in the middle of trying to finalize it all.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.360]   Okay. Where we went, what we did, who we saw, like all that stuff.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.640]   I have all that stuff, but it'll be somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. It'll be killer.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.600]   Awesome. Yeah. That's like a coffee table book.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.960]   It's coming out hopefully for September.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.600]   And it's basically it's called what I learned about America. That's amazing.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:42.000]   Visiting all 48 States. We jumped quickly to something totally different.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.200]   So first off, thanks for all of that. Of course.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.520]   I really enjoyed the conversation.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.200]   I think people are going to want to hear all these tips because we normally end
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:52.280]   every episode asking people find a place. What do you suggest they eat?
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.840]   Do have a drink? Where do they go? I'll let you,
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.440]   I'll punt on 48 state answer for the book,
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.520]   but I'm curious if there's one place that whether it was on your trip or in LA,
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.760]   that you have some recommendations for people, maybe traveling there.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.880]   I don't know this summer.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:12.920]   I think one of the best spots that I've still can't get over is still
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.320]   Whistler, British Columbia.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:19.480]   It's one of my favorite spots in the world in the summer, winter,
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.520]   everything looks like, well, so all the places are great,
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.520]   but in the summer is a unique experience because it's like being in the middle
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.960]   of the wilderness, but with all the trappings of everything,
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.160]   which is just really, really cool. So that's what I would say.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.960]   If you've never been there, that'd be the place I would go.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.320]   But if you're in LA and you want great sushi, that's a whole other thing.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.840]   I will second your Whistler.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:45.600]   I went on a bachelor party in Whistler and I will encourage anyone going
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.840]   there to try their mountain biking trails, which are out of this world.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.760]   I felt like I was biking through an Ewok village with these like elevated ramps.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.720]   One person is so smooth and just nonstop. You're like, wow.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.920]   One person did break their legs. So for him, it was not as smooth,
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.600]   but for the rest of us, we had a good time. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:08.040]   Where can people stay on top of everything you're doing and find out when this
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:08.880]   book's coming out?
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.440]   I'm easy to find on my socials at Brant Penvidic.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:14.400]   You can go to three minute rule.com and see all that kind of stuff.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.400]   My travel club, you can visit that reject average.com.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.520]   I'm pretty easy to find. I have a lot going on.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.040]   I just don't have a lot going on. I don't sell anything. I don't have a course.
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:26.120]   I'm not trying to get people's money. I don't take on new clients right now.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:30.200]   I'm just out doing my thing. I love helping people find the value in their message.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.240]   It's like one of those things.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.480]   I've had fortune 500 CEOs in almost tears because of the thing they've been
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.240]   working on for years. They're finally able to explain it properly.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.400]   And it's like the frustration of having something that you really believe in,
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.600]   that you love and you can't get people to understand it or believe in it is
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.160]   overwhelming. And it's just, it's kind of great to be able to help people do that.
