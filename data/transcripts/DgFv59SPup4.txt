[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   I watched some points go on sale this year,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.960]   and I realized there are a lot of different ways
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.040]   that you can get points
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.700]   than just by earning them on a credit card.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.920]   For one, many airlines and hotel groups
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.500]   constantly have sales on points.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.780]   For example, of my 12 favorite transfer partners
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.100]   from my credit cards,
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.960]   points go on sale for as low as 1.15 to 1.2 cents,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.160]   and that's on Life Miles or Aeroplan,
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.000]   and on average across all the partners that sell points,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.920]   they go on sale for about 1.5 cents per point.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.100]   And depending on the partner,
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.020]   they go on sale as often as every one to three months.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.400]   And then there's some points
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.360]   that I don't actually even like transferring to,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.400]   though I do think they have good value,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.680]   that go on sale for as little as half a cent a point,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.260]   like Hilton or close to that for Choice Hotels and Marriott.
