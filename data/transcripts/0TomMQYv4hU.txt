[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.760]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the second chapter, reading from the forty-first
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.680]   verse to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:22.720]   "Then they that gladly received his word were baptized; and the same day there were
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.580]   added unto them about three thousand souls; and they continued steadfastly in the apostles'
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.300]   doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.420]   And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.500]   And all that believed were together, and had all things common, and sold their possessions
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500]   and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.460]   And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.340]   to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.620]   having favour with all the people.
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.780]   And the Lord added to the church daily such as should, or if you prefer it, such as were
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.540]   being saved."
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.700]   Now we come back once more to a consideration of this most important and interesting statement.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.300]   It is, you see, an account of the beginning of the Christian Church, and it is because
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.140]   it is an account of the beginning of the Christian Church that I am directing attention to it.
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.500]   This is my argument, this is the position that I would put before you.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.700]   We are here not because we happen to be a body of men and women who are interested in
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.500]   this sort of thing, merely as other people are interested perhaps in watching some drama
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.940]   tonight or others in listening to music.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:09.140]   No, we are here because we believe that this is the church of God, and that we are in the
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.260]   house of God, and that it is a place in which we meet with God and can listen to his message.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.260]   Why do we do that?
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.020]   Well, we do that because we know, we believe—this is what makes a man a Christian, as we have
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.700]   been seeing—that as we all are by nature, we are under the wrath of God.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.420]   We have come to see that the world is as it is because it is under the wrath of God.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.100]   A blind man said once to our Lord a very true thing, "God heareth not sinners," and he
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.100]   doesn't.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.980]   It is no use expecting God to bless men who deliberately flout him and rebel against him
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.000]   and insult his holy name.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.020]   There can be no question—I think it was established clearly last Sunday night—that
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.660]   the world is as it is tonight because the wrath of God is being revealed against all
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.900]   ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.820]   God withdraws his restraining powers.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.980]   He hands the world over at times to a reprobate mind.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.380]   He allows men and women to reap the consequences of their own foolish thinking.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.020]   They say there is no God and that they can live without a God, that they can manage their
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.020]   own affairs.
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.620]   Well, they are being allowed to see what happens when they do.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.460]   That is one of the ways in which God manifests his wrath upon the rebellion and the arrogance
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.460]   of men.
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:52.620]   Therefore, on the other side, we believe and we preach that the only hope for any individual,
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.260]   the only hope in the world tonight, is the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.460]   The Christian Church is the institution formed, founded, by the Lord himself in order to preach
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.760]   and to propagate his message.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.660]   He chose certain men unto himself in the days of his flesh and he instructed them, gave
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.020]   them knowledge and information, gave them proofs concerning himself and his own deity
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.940]   and so on, and then, after he had ascended into heaven, he sent down his Holy Spirit
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.100]   upon them to give them power, to give them authority.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.700]   What we read in the second chapter of the book of Acts, as we have seen on a previous
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.980]   Sunday night, is how that power did come down on the famous day of Pentecost in Jerusalem
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.580]   and had this transforming effect upon these very disciples and apostles of the Lord Jesus
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.580]   Christ.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.580]   How did they begin to preach?
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.500]   Peter, Peter was the spokesman, and he preached a sermon on that day and as a result of that,
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.740]   as this record tells us, three thousand people became Christian and were added to the Christian
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.740]   Church.
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.060]   Now then, my argument is that here we have the only authentic account of what it means
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.320]   to be a Christian and as to what the Christian message is and as to what the Christian Church
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.320]   is.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.500]   Now, there is this extraordinary confusion about this at the present time, that's what
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.520]   impels one to do this so constantly.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.580]   Of all the muddle that characterizes the world tonight, and the world perhaps has never been
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.580]   in such a muddle, there's political muddle, there's moral muddle, philosophic muddle,
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.500]   everything is in a state of muddle, but of all the muddles, this is the greatest and
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.980]   this is the most tragic.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:51.020]   Because when you get confusion about this, the only hope is as it were put out, and people
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.300]   don't even consider it, and it's all because they will substitute their own ideas for what
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.620]   is laid down here so plainly and so clearly.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.820]   Now they do this, alas, I've got to say it, they do this in the Church as well as outside
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.840]   the Church, and that is why there is all this muddle.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.800]   But our business, as we value our own souls, and as we have a concern about the state of
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.760]   our fellow men and women, is to be clear as to what Christianity is, and as to what the
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   Church is.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.600]   Now that's what we are doing, and what we've seen is this.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.320]   The Christian is a man who is born again.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.640]   Now that's so patent in this story.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.680]   These Jews, the people who cried out a few weeks back about our Lord, away with him,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680]   crucify him.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.260]   They are now suddenly pricked in their hearts when they listen to Peter.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.240]   They are pricked in their hearts, and they said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.680]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.440]   The Holy Spirit has convicted them, and he's brought them to see their error, and they
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.120]   acknowledge it and confess it, 'Repent,' says Peter, 'and be baptized every one of
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.280]   you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.'"
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   And they did that.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.000]   And as a result of doing that, they submitted themselves to baptism, and they joined the
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Christian Church.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.120]   Now, that's how people become Christians, but what it implies, you see, is this, that
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.520]   a Christian is a man who has undergone a profound change.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.160]   You can't imagine a greater change than this.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.280]   A Christian is not merely a man who is a little bit different from others.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.240]   He's entirely different.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.760]   He's altogether different.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.840]   He's not just a man who's been improved a little bit.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.800]   No, no, he's a new man.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   He's a new creation.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.000]   He's a new creature.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   He's born again.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   He is regenerated.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.160]   Now, that's the teaching.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.320]   He becomes an entirely different person.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   He's got new life.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.480]   Indeed, he has the life of God in the soul.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.480]   Now, that's the fundamental proposition.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.000]   Now, then, having seen that, we see something else that follows immediately and directly
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.240]   from that, and it is this, that this new life immediately begins to express itself.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.480]   Now, life always expresses itself.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.560]   It's bound to do so.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.840]   The moment a child is born, he expresses the fact that he's alive.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.920]   He moves.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.760]   He desires food, and so on.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.160]   These are expressions of life.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.440]   A dummy wouldn't do that.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.160]   A live child does.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.280]   Life always manifests itself, always shows itself in some shape or form.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.000]   It has a vitality about it.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Well, that is equally true about this new life that is in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.760]   And what I am trying to show you is this.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.940]   It is the thing that is put before us here, that everything the Christian is and does
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.560]   is an expression of this new life that is in him.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.320]   I mean by that, not his every single action, but the main bent and characteristic of his
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.320]   life.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   Or, if you like, the other way around, I'll put it like this.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.760]   A Christian is a man who can only be explained in terms of the fact that he's got new life
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.640]   in him, that he's got the life of God in him.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.960]   Didn't our Lord say that, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.600]   have it more abundantly"?
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   What's he mean?
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.240]   Well, he means that without that, we haven't got life.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240]   We exist.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.680]   Man without Christ exists.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.680]   No more.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   It's existence.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.440]   That's not life.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.160]   He alone gives life, and he's come that we might have life, and that we might have it
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.520]   more abundantly.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:49.160]   So, the only way in which you can really explain a Christian is that he's a man who's received
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:55.520]   this new life, this more abundant life, from our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.320]   Now, then, the moment a man receives that life, it begins to show itself.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.600]   And what we are considering at the moment is the ways in which it does so.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:11.160]   Now, last Sunday night, we considered one thing only, and that was entirely negative.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:17.520]   The first thing a man does when he has this new life is to separate himself from the world.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:23.120]   Peter exhorted them to do that, with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying,
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:34.600]   "Save yourselves from this untoward generation, this crooked generation, this malignant generation,
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.440]   this rebellious generation, this condemned generation."
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.640]   And we saw the way in which a man who becomes a Christian immediately does that, and we
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.400]   give the reasons for that.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.920]   Now, they did it here at the very beginning, 3,000 of them on one occasion, and others
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   were added to the church daily as these men went on preaching this message.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.760]   And this is what has continued throughout the running centuries.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.520]   And it's as true tonight as it was nearly 2,000 years ago.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.800]   But now let us turn to the positive aspect of this.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.480]   How does this new life manifest itself in a positive manner?
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.560]   And again I want to show you that it does so in a way that is almost the exact opposite
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.440]   of what men and women imagine it to be.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.800]   Now, I keep on putting this to you like this, and I put it to you as intelligent people
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.680]   to work it out for yourselves.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.120]   Here's a problem for you.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.840]   How does it come to pass that with an open Bible in front of us, and with a record such
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:43.200]   as this, that men and women think instinctively about the Christian and about Christianity
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.960]   and the church in a manner that is an exact contradiction of what we find here?
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.320]   Now, there's only one answer to that.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.880]   That is because of what the Bible calls seven.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.880]   The Bible says that sin blinds us, blinds us, confuses our understanding, that though
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.200]   you put truth before a man, he can't see it.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.520]   There's no other explanation.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.720]   Well, now let's see this as it's worked out.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.240]   And again, as I put this to you, I trust that it's plain and fair to all of us that while
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.660]   I am giving a positive definition of how a man shows that he's a Christian, this becomes
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.040]   a very real test of every one of us.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.600]   Do we conform to this picture?
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.440]   Is this true of us?
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.360]   Is this the kind of person we are?
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.120]   Is this the sort of thing we are doing?
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.720]   These things are absolutes.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.960]   There's no getting away from them.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.880]   We either are Christians or else we are not.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.360]   And we know whether we are or not in the light of this truth.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   Very well, now then.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.400]   Here it's put to us in a number of verses.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.360]   They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.240]   bread and in prayers.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.840]   Verse 44, all that believed were together and had all things common.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:09.560]   Verse 45, sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.560]   need.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:19.120]   And 46, and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.520]   house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.920]   Now, what I want to emphasize particularly tonight are verses 42 and 46.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:36.920]   They continued steadfastly, steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.760]   breaking of bread and of prayer.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:48.700]   Verse 46, and they continuing, continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:56.320]   bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.080]   Now then, surely that is a perfectly clear picture.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:07.440]   These men had become Christians, they'd undergone this new birth, they'd become entirely different
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   men.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.320]   How do they show it?
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.000]   Negatively, they show it by separating themselves from what they were.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.920]   They used to belong to the world and they did the things of the world and they thought
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.320]   they were marvelous.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.720]   They separate themselves, that's negative, positive.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   They joined the Church and they continue in this way in the Church.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.720]   Let me divide this up for you.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:38.920]   The first thing we are told is this, that they came together constantly.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:46.480]   They continued steadfastly and they continuing daily.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.120]   They came together, all who believed these things, all who were Christians, they were
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.120]   to be found together constantly.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:02.240]   Now here's my proposition, that is one of the first tests that you must apply to yourself
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:07.880]   or to anybody else in order to discover whether you or they are Christians.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:15.240]   My argument is that this new life is bound to express itself and the first way in which
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:23.880]   it expresses itself is that they all come together and they do so constantly.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.240]   Shall I emphasize this by putting it negatively to you?
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.920]   I argue from this definition that it is impossible for a man to be a Christian unless he does
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   this.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:42.360]   If you don't feel this desire to come together with other Christians, I say there's only
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.200]   one explanation, you are not a Christian.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.360]   Now you would have thought that it's unnecessary to say a thing like that, but it is, you know.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.040]   It interests me always when I'm preaching a series of sermons like this to see how often
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.680]   the newspapers provide me with just the illustration that I need.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.200]   There may be some people here tonight, I'm sure there are, there are certain churchgoers
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.280]   who begin to say to themselves, why is he doing all this, isn't this all so obvious,
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:15.000]   isn't he setting up some imaginary Aunt Sally's in order that he may knock them down,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   isn't he just doing that?
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.360]   Well, lest there may be somebody who thinks something like that, let me read to you what
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:26.320]   I found in the Evening Standard on February the 12th.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:35.360]   Here was a bold heading and a photograph of a certain clergyman and a statement attributed
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.560]   to a man called Mr. Brooks.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:44.480]   Mr. Brooks and his wife were anxious that a child of theirs should be christened, but
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:51.320]   the clergyman, the Reverend Dennis Jeans, refused to do so unless Mr. and Mrs. Brooks
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.360]   and the godparents attended a class of instruction.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.800]   They didn't go to the church, they didn't attend the church, but they deplied that their
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:07.360]   child might be christened, and the minister said no, unless you and, the both of you and
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.640]   the godparents attend this instruction class in order that you may be quite clear in your
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.680]   minds as to what's happening, I cannot baptize you a child.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:22.240]   Mr. Brooks commented like this to the Evening Standard reporter, "Although I am a Christian,
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:31.800]   I am strictly the non-churchgoing type, believing," listen, he hasn't finished, "believing that
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:39.680]   most churchgoers are hypocrites and do it merely for convention's sake.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:47.400]   I am a Christian, although I am a Christian, I am strictly the non-churchgoing type."
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:55.240]   He adds, "It seems to me that as a reason in a vision, this desire, this request that
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:03.040]   they should attend this instruction class, represents a desperate last-ditch attempt
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:10.680]   to bring people into the churches in exchange for priestly favours."
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:18.040]   And then the final statement is this, "The vicar says that this offer was adamantly refused,
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.680]   and he told me he thought a person was as good a Christian without attending church
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.520]   as a regular communicant."
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:31.000]   Well, now, that's the sort of reason, you see, why I hold these things before you.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.640]   Here is a man who says that you can be a Christian, but strictly the non-churchgoing type, and
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.520]   that indeed he's a better Christian than those who do go to church.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:48.520]   Those who go to church are just hypocrites, and that they're doing it out of mere tradition
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.320]   and for convention's sake.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.800]   Here he says, "I am a Christian, a fine Christian, but I don't go to church, I am
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   not that type."
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.480]   Now, I am simply trying to show you that according to the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, such
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:07.080]   a man, I don't know him, but I can tell you this about him, that man is not a Christian.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.840]   He is just not a Christian.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.880]   It isn't simply because of the insulting remarks he makes about those who do attend
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.260]   the place of worship, but let's be as fair as we can to him.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.200]   Let's grant him that many who do go to church are hypocrites.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.360]   I have no doubt there are many such people, and I am not here to defend them.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.520]   I know there are hypocrites in the church.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.880]   I know there are people who are mere traditionalists.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.280]   I know there are many people in churches who have no idea why they do it, nor what it means
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.280]   to be a Christian.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.080]   All right, we'll grant him all that, but he says that's true of all of them.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.000]   But that isn't my reason for saying that this man is not a Christian.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.940]   I say he's not a Christian because he is saying something which is the exact opposite
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.700]   of what we are told in the New Testament.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:56.020]   He is behaving in a manner that is a direct denial and contradiction of what these first
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:02.220]   Christians did, what all other true Christians have always done.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:07.760]   So I'm putting this point in a negative way to you.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:13.000]   The first Christians, I say, came together, and the first indication of new life, divine
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.880]   life, is a drawing together of people who have this in common.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:25.640]   Now you see what a contradiction this is to this modern idea, that the preachers today
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.880]   are simply concerned with their own bread and cheese and trying somehow anyhow to get
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880]   a congregation.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.500]   This man in the interview goes on to point out that very soon if they continue like this
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:43.120]   they won't have any congregations at all, we're not interested in that.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.880]   He talks about it as a just social formality and so on, and things of that description.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.560]   It doesn't matter about that.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.920]   All I'm here to say is this.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:01.000]   The concern of the Apostle Peter when he preached that sermon was not to gather a congregation.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.240]   It was to save souls.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.320]   And that is the business of the Christian church.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.740]   It is to proclaim the truth to men and women.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:16.560]   Now the difficulty I'm in is this, you see, and as I'm going to show you, that so often
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:22.160]   the church herself violates the principle of her own being and behaves in a manner that
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.320]   justifies the kind of statement that is made by this Mr. Brooks.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   But that's not New Testament.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.840]   And as far as I'm concerned, I'm only interested in this.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.760]   I'm not interested in Christendom.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.240]   I'm not interested in the organized church as such.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.440]   I am interested in the church of the living God, the New Testament church.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.080]   I recognize no other.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.080]   I'm not here to defend institutions.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.600]   I am here to show what the true church is and what the true gospel is.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:59.360]   So a man who never attends a place of worship at all is by definition not a Christian.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.440]   He hasn't got the life in him, he's saying so.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:10.880]   Secondly, I would say that those who do so merely occasionally are, to put them at their
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.160]   highest, only very doubtful Christians.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:19.160]   There are many people in this country who only go to church once a year, Easter Sunday.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:25.480]   I cannot reconcile such conduct with what I read here.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:31.000]   There are people who only go infrequently, now and again, when they've got nothing better
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   to do.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.360]   They go to a place of worship.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.440]   Can you fit that into what you read here?
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.880]   My friends, this is the only standard.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.880]   We've got no other way of measuring people.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.000]   It isn't what you or I or Mr. Brooks think makes a man a Christian.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.480]   It'd be interesting to know what his idea of a Christian is.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.480]   There's no difficulty.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.360]   He thinks he's a good man, he's a good moral man, he's therefore much better than those
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.680]   hypocrites who go to church.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.520]   You see, the poor man, he knows nothing about Christianity.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.000]   He thinks he does, but he doesn't.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.440]   He's proving he doesn't.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.720]   His spirit proves it, his action proves it still more.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.240]   But now I say this applies not only to a man like that, but to people who only do this
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.240]   occasionally.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.320]   They keep up the membership, as it were, pay the subscription once a year, and they think
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   they're church members.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.640]   They think they're Christians.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.200]   They think they belong to the true church.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   Can you fit that in?
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.160]   Let me give you a third possibility.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.280]   What about those who only do it as a social matter?
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.880]   Going to church, you know, can be nothing but a part of the social realm.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.240]   Often after years of this sort of thing, people go to a morning service and then they go and
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.280]   have their sherry party together before they go back to lunch.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.360]   Is that, can you fit that in here?
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:47.000]   Part of the social realm, a social custom, my dear friends, isn't it patent here on the
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.200]   very surface that when a man becomes a Christian, when he's born again, when he's got this new
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:59.920]   life in him, this association with other Christians is the very center of his life.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.840]   It is the chiefest thing in his life.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:09.840]   They continue steadfastly, and they're continuing daily with one accord in the temple and from
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.840]   house to house.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.800]   This was the biggest thing, the central thing in their lives.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:20.760]   If it isn't this, is there real evidence of Christianity?
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.860]   But let me go on to a second principle.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:31.920]   These men not only came together regularly, but they came together willingly, willingly.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:37.560]   They didn't come reluctantly, they didn't come in a spirit of fear, they didn't come
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.880]   merely as a task or as a duty.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.240]   Now let me put that in this form.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:51.800]   I remember very well in days when I attended a place of worship and when I most certainly
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.280]   was not a Christian.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:02.200]   I used to hear sermons quite often from the pulpit, slashing those of us who were church
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.920]   members for not attending all the meetings.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.280]   I resented it at the time.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.820]   I had a feeling that it was wrong, but I couldn't understand it.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.360]   My reply sitting in the pew to the minister was this, in my own mind, "Well, the question
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.760]   you ought to ask yourself is why don't people come?"
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.580]   And perhaps if you examine that question thoroughly, you may find the answer in yourself and not
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.580]   in the people.
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:30.140]   However, that was just a sort of non-Christian way of giving an answer to this attack that
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.500]   came from the pulpit.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:38.600]   But since then, thank God, I think I've got a bit of an understanding into these things,
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:44.080]   and that is why I never appeal to people to attend a place of worship.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:49.440]   I don't think you can ever bring a record against me in the case in which I have chastised
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.160]   people for not attending services or public worship.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:58.980]   I've never asked anybody to join this church or any other church where I've been minister.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.980]   Why not?
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.520]   Well, because I believe the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:08.120]   You see, I don't even put a test on the meeting asking people to come forward at the end.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.120]   Why?
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.420]   Well, because what I believe in is this, that there is a type of preaching, there is an
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.840]   action of the Spirit that makes the congregation cry out, "Men and brethren, what shall we
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.800]   do?"
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.200]   I don't understand this pressure brought to bear upon people to make them decide or to
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.000]   make them attend services.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.560]   What I say is this, "If you don't do this sort of thing, are you a Christian at all?"
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:39.720]   These men were born again, and they manifested it by continuing steadfastly.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.520]   They didn't do it reluctantly, they didn't do it as a task.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.200]   You didn't have to round them up and have a kind of whipper-in to bring them and to
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.440]   watch them and say, "You were not here last meeting."
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.680]   They were there steadfastly, day by day, constantly.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   You couldn't keep them apart.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.320]   That's how it was at the beginning, that's how it has always been in every period of
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:04.480]   Reformation and of revival, I could illustrate it to you without limit almost from some of
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.480]   the great revivals.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.880]   Think of it two hundred years ago, the great evangelical Methodist awakening.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.880]   That was true of them.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.960]   They were always together, coming together in this exact same way, and they've done it
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.960]   at all times when the Church has been truly alive.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:25.320]   They desired this, they couldn't be kept away from it, they wanted more and more of it.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.720]   And you notice this, they didn't want just the briefest possible diet of worship.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.760]   They did it every day, and they'd go on for hours, and when they'd finish their work they'd
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.680]   go to one another's houses, and they'd continue it in little groups.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.280]   You see how far removed all this is from what has become so customary in this country, and
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.560]   the common notion as to what Christianity is.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:55.000]   Drag yourself reluctantly to a service on a Sunday morning, and you hope and pray, if
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.480]   you pray at all, that it won't be too long, particularly the sermon.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.040]   I'm told that there are certain churches now which carry this out to such an extent that
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.960]   the poor man who comes to preach is given the program at 11 a.m., and then he'll find
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:14.800]   at the end of his program 12 p.m. benediction.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.000]   Not even given any choice in the matter, you see, it's got to stop, it mustn't be too long.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.400]   Now, my dear friends, all I'm putting to you is this.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.200]   Can you fit that sort of thing into this book of the Acts of the Apostles?
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:35.680]   Can't you see that this coming together was the greatest joy in these people's lives?
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.940]   Work was almost an interruption to them, they had to fight over this matter, there are indications
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.440]   of that in the New Testament.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.400]   They wanted to spend all their time together, and that they'd be exhorted to go and do their
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.360]   work and to earn their bread and butter, and so on.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.360]   Their instinct was always to come together, and you couldn't keep them apart.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.800]   This is the expression of this life.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:01.040]   Let me come to a third principle which is shown here, which is this.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.120]   That this is something which is true of people of all types and of all kinds.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.840]   That's the most important point.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.760]   You know the modern idea that this is only true of a certain type, the religious type.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.880]   People have got the religious complex.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.240]   You can recognize them, you can type them, the great psychologists have got them all
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   tabulated.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   Quite simple, they say.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.360]   And of course, it only happens with that particular type, and in their kindness of heart, they're
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.320]   prepared to say they don't object to our doing it if we want to do that sort of thing, as
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.880]   long as they're given liberty to do what they want to do.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.680]   And when you get a fussy clergyman like this saying that obviously you keep certain rules
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.220]   if you belong to any society, you just regard him as a difficult person, and so on.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.720]   Why can't you be a very good Christian outside, and very much better indeed than those hypocrites
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.480]   who are inside, and so on?
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.080]   Now that's the popular common argument today.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:56.120]   The answer is given here quite plainly.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:01.440]   Here gathered in Jerusalem on this great day of Pentecost, we are told, were people from
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.720]   all parts of the world.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:13.720]   There were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under him.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:21.120]   They came from places like Carthage, there were Medes and Elamites, dwellers in Mesopotamia,
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:27.760]   Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Libya, Cyrene, strangers
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:33.120]   of Rome, Jews, proselytes, Cretes, Arabians.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.480]   There was never such a cosmopolitan gathering.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.520]   And yet you see what happened under the influence of this preaching and the power and demonstration
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.260]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.520]   Men out of all these different nations and groupings were gathered together and they
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.360]   wanted to continue steadfastly.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   They were all one, united, and wanted to go on being together.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:02.000]   In other words, and this is to me a most important and fundamental principle, it is in many ways
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:11.640]   one of the most important proofs of the reality of the new birth, the fact of regeneration.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.560]   You see, it proves it like this.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:20.960]   Here are people who, taken by nature, are all of them different from one another, different
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:31.200]   nationalities, different classes in society, some employers, some workers, some in professions,
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.760]   some doing more mechanical work.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.680]   Not only that, men and women differing tremendously in temperament.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.280]   It is always interesting to notice the twelve disciples of our Lord, how different they
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   were from one another.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.680]   Take, for instance, a man like John and a man like Peter, two entirely different men,
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.640]   and the Apostle Paul is altogether different again.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:59.240]   You cannot imagine different temperaments, and by nature we are all of different temperaments.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.360]   And then we differ in our abilities.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:08.440]   Some are very able, some are less able, some are highly gifted intellectually, some are
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.000]   very poor in that respect.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.600]   But the great thing that we are told here and elsewhere in the New Testament, indeed
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:22.740]   everywhere in the New Testament, is this, that all these different types and kinds come
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.440]   together and are made one.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:31.400]   There is this extraordinary unity which is deeper than all the superficial divisions
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.920]   and distinctions.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.400]   And this is something that has continued in the history of the Church throughout the centuries
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.040]   and right down to this very night tonight.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.240]   And to me it is an absolute proof of the reality of this new birth.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.920]   Look at this great illustration that we saw in the reading at the beginning from the first
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.760]   epistle to the Corinthians in the first chapter.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.800]   The Apostle Paul is writing to people to whom he can say, "You see, you are calling, brethren,
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:06.000]   how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called."
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.120]   It is clear that the majority of the members of the Church at Corinth were not highly gifted
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.400]   people in an intellectual sense.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.240]   They were not great philosophers.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.880]   They were simple people.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.120]   The world called them foolish; the philosophers certainly called them foolish.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:31.920]   And yet this is the amazing and astonishing thing, that this man, the Apostle Paul, with
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:38.840]   probably one of the greatest brains that a man has ever had inside his cranium, was able
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.640]   to enjoy the most intimate and glorious fellowship with them.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.600]   He writes a letter to the Church at Rome, and there again you got the same thing.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.520]   Most of the members of the Church seem to be slaves in Caesar's household.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:58.320]   And yet the Apostle can write like this to them, "I long to see you, that I may impart
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:04.600]   unto you some spiritual gift to the end, that you may be established; that is, that I may
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:10.920]   be comforted together with you by the mutual faith, both of you and me."
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.320]   Here is this giant intellect, this colossus.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:22.000]   And yet he enjoys the most intimate and enjoyable fellowship with slaves, ignorant people who
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.680]   have none of his learning and all his great erudition.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.280]   Here was a man who was not only a trained Pharisee, but was familiar with the Greek
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.800]   poets and so on, and probably knew a great deal about Roman law.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   Here he is.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.560]   He can sit down amongst them, the slaves, the ignoramuses, and they're having a marvellous
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.560]   fellowship.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   Why?
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.920]   Well, there's only one answer.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.100]   Something in common has entered into the lives of these people, and that thing in common
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.680]   is nothing but this rebirth.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:35:00.840]   So you see that they can continue steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.220]   and of breaking of bread and of prayer.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.520]   My friend, it doesn't matter what you are by nature.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:14.000]   That's why I've always said that a preacher of the Gospel, unlike a medical doctor, never
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.360]   needs to know the details about his people.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.040]   You know, if you're a medical doctor and somebody comes to you, it's very important
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.720]   that you should know something about them.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.800]   You want the history.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.640]   What exactly is the trouble?
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.280]   Where is that pain?
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.360]   You must have your details, so they state their case.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.600]   And you put your questions and you get all the details.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.640]   Then you say, "Well, now I wonder, is this hereditary?"
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.760]   So you want the family history.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.240]   You can't make a true diagnosis without going into these things very thoroughly.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.640]   Want to know about the father and mother?
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   Are they still alive?
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.560]   If they're not, what did they die of?
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.240]   Ah, you see, that's got relevance here.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.880]   This thing seems to run in the family.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.200]   It's important, you see, that you should know all this, and you go back to the grandparents
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.760]   and so on, and where do they live and the circumstances and so on.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.040]   All these things are important.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.400]   Is this man working too hard?
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.080]   Is this the stress of modern life?
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.240]   Is this the strain or anxiety of his profession?
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:18.280]   You must know all these things, because you can't make a diagnosis without them.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:24.880]   But you know, the work of a preacher is altogether different.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.880]   Why is it different?
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.520]   Oh, I can tell you why it's different.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:33.580]   None of those things matter at all here.
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:39.140]   Here we are concerned not with diseases, but with one disease.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:44.040]   We are not so much interested in symptoms as in the disease itself, and there's only
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:49.440]   one disease, and the disease is called sin.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.440]   And it doesn't matter, you see, what a man is.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.800]   It doesn't matter whether he's a great giant intellect or whether he's an ignoramus.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.880]   It doesn't make the slightest difference, because I know they're both sinners.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.720]   I know everybody's a sinner.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.680]   I don't know you individually, but I know you're a sinner.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.200]   You are a sinner because everybody's a sinner, because I'm a sinner.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.320]   We're all sinners.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.500]   I know that, so I don't need to have a long history.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.400]   I don't want to know about your father or mother, because I know they were sinners also.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.520]   I know that there is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.600]   And I know that all the divisions and the distinctions don't make the slightest difference
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.100]   to that.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.880]   Intellect is not immune from immorality.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.240]   Self-righteousness is not immune from certain failures and weaknesses.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   Tell me all about yourself.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   It doesn't matter.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.200]   You don't change the picture at all.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.960]   I know it's still exactly the same.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.600]   One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:57.680]   That's why every nation, every color, every conceivable temperament and personality, all
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:03.080]   these things come down to a common denominator.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.400]   And that is why, you see, they all need the same thing, and when they get it, they're
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   given the same thing.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.480]   They're given the same life, and the new life expresses itself in them all.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:18.420]   It's deeper than intellect, deeper than nationality, deeper than temperament, deeper than gifts
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.600]   and possessions, deeper than everything.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.000]   It controls the whole of the life and the whole outlook of the personality.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.560]   Now then, that brings me to my next principle, which is this.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.280]   Why do all these different people come together?
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.040]   Why do they want to come together?
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.520]   Why can't you keep them apart, as it were?
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.380]   Why do they come voluntarily, without being forced?
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.800]   Why do they delight in this?
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.360]   Why does this become the central thing of their lives?
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.000]   Well, it's all here before us.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.720]   The answer is perfectly simple.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.240]   The world, in a sense, has got an answer to this.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.280]   It's got a proverb which says that birds of a feather flock together, and of course it's
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.920]   true, and this is true in the spiritual realm.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:07.120]   The Apostle Paul writes to the church at Ephesus and talks about the unity of the Spirit in
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.440]   the bond of peace.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:16.320]   Jude writes his letter and he talks about the common salvation.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.320]   That's it.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   These are the terms.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:24.200]   That section which I read to you in the beginning, out of the first chapter of 1 Corinthians,
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.280]   puts the thing negatively.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.240]   A Christian, you see, isn't perfect immediately.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.840]   No, no, it takes time to make us perfect, and none of us will be perfect in this world,
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.360]   but we are being perfected.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.360]   And there they were.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:40.480]   They were born again, but the devil was busy, and he'd come in and he'd cause divisions
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.160]   amongst them, and there were foolish people who didn't detect his hand and were becoming
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:48.440]   his instruments and causing divisions.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.400]   And the Apostle reprimands them.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.440]   He says, "Do you realize that you are a church?
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.840]   Do you realize that Christ and he alone was crucified for you?
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.460]   You're interested in Paul or Apollos or Cephas?"
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.320]   He says, "Have you forgotten what it is to be a Christian and what it is that makes a
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   Christian church?"
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.760]   There you see the negative enforcing this great principle.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.320]   Why do these people come together and continue steadfastly in the Apostle's doctrine and
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.120]   fellowship and breaking of bread and of prayer?
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.560]   Well, the simple answer is this.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:26.600]   They've become members of the same family.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.540]   They've got the same blood in them, if you like.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.560]   They've got the same life in them.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:37.860]   They were born of the Spirit, the life of God had entered into their souls.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.640]   These people are drawn together as the members of a family are drawn together.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.120]   Now, there's something about this that's almost mystical, and you can't always analyze
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:52.480]   it and define it in terms and in words, but you see, we say, don't we, "Blood is thicker
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.480]   than water."
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.760]   You may have disputes in the family, but you let an outsider begin to attack and you're
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.560]   all one immediately and all against him.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.200]   "Blood is thicker than water."
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   Of course it is.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.120]   Yes, and the life of God in the soul is thicker even than natural blood.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:11.280]   Here is something, as I showed you last Sunday, that cuts even into family life, brings out
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:17.440]   one and another out of another, makes them one, and they're brethren together.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.440]   What is this?
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:26.960]   Well, I say, this is all but a manifestation of this new life that has come into a man's
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.960]   soul.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   And what it does is this.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.080]   It gives them all the same outlook.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:39.280]   Though we are living in the same world as everybody else, Christian people have got
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   a different outlook.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:46.040]   They see themselves differently.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.320]   The man of the world thinks of this world only and about his money and his success,
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:54.320]   food, drink, clothing, sex, excitement, pleasure.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.240]   That's his outlook, isn't it?
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.400]   Isn't the Christian's outlook?
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.880]   What's his view of life?
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.720]   Well, it's entirely different from that other one, but all Christians have the same
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:14.440]   fundamental view on life in this world, the whole state of the world, the whole history
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.440]   of the world.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.100]   They've got the same view of death.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.100]   What is this?
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:25.640]   Well, you see, this is something that divides us off completely from what we were.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:31.560]   The Christian is a man, as I've shown you, who is awakened to the fact that he lives
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:40.060]   under God, that much more important than this world is the other world that he can't see.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.680]   He's got to live in this world, he's all right about that.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.480]   He doesn't go out of the world.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.320]   Some people have foolishly thought that, that you couldn't be a Christian and live in the
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.920]   world, so they became monks and hermits and so on.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.360]   No, no, that isn't the picture, here's the picture.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.920]   Yes, though you're living in the same world, you realize you're not of it, your whole
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.880]   outlook has changed.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.980]   The things that used to interest you and attract you no longer do so.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:11.920]   You now start from this tremendous postulate that you're a man, that you're made in
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:17.440]   the image and likeness of God, and that you're going on to meet him, that life is passing.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.560]   In short, you now must think about this before you tried not to think about it, you switched
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.840]   on the wireless, you had a glass of whiskey, you took a drug, you did anything you did
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.920]   not to think.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.920]   But now you say, "But I must think, it's madness not to, my life is moving on and I'm
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:36.280]   moving on, and there's God and eternity, there's judgment and my everlasting condition."
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:42.500]   Your whole outlook is governed by that.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:48.560]   And isn't it quite inevitable that you should desire to be spending your time to view things
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.120]   in this world in the same way?
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.280]   Of course, you want to know more about this, and you want to talk about this, and you feel
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.560]   attracted to this.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.160]   You know you're different from the other people, and you can't enter into the enjoyment
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   as you used to.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.240]   This is inevitable.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:12.440]   It's because of life with a new outlook, a new understanding, a new orientation, if
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.440]   you like.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:18.200]   And it's not only that, you see, these people have all had exactly the same fundamental
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.840]   experience.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:27.880]   Now I don't mean by that that in every single detail they've had the same dramatic type
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   of experience.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.520]   That isn't so.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:35.520]   What I'm saying is that they've had the same fundamental experience.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.120]   What's that?
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:41.680]   Well, I'll put it like this.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:47.720]   A man cannot be a Christian without knowing that he's been awakened to these tremendous
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:56.240]   truths which I've just been mentioning to you.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:02.080]   He used to live that other life, and he knew that life of struggle and of failure, that
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:09.040]   life of futility, and he knew what it was to be a failure, and to be miserable, and
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.520]   to be sad, and to say, "Oh, isn't there no way out of this?
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.520]   Can't I start afresh?
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.480]   Can't I live a new life?"
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:22.520]   And yet it all always ended in utter futility.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:33.040]   But now he knows that he's got a new life, he's been delivered, he's been set free.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.880]   There is this essential difference in his life.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.840]   He's not perfect, as I say, but he knows there's something in him and about him that
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.080]   wasn't there before.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.680]   It varies in its dramatic intensity from case to case, but it is a common experience in
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.680]   all Christians.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:54.520]   He is no longer hopeless, he is no longer left to himself.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:46:02.400]   He knows another, same experience, and that in turn, as I say, leads to the same desires
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.360]   and the same interests.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.120]   These are the things that now interest us and attract us.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:17.040]   All this is put in many of the hymns, "Through the night of doubt and sorrow onward goes
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   the pilgrim band."
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.040]   Why?
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.840]   Well, they're one, as the hymn goes on to say, in so many different respects.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:32.960]   "One the hope that never dies and that never tires."
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.800]   These men are absolutely different.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.400]   They don't understand themselves fully.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.760]   I'm not saying they understand themselves.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.520]   What I am saying is that they know they're different, something's happened to them.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:47.320]   They don't belong where they used to, they belong to another lot, and all these others
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.720]   are alike in these fundamental respects.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.060]   So they continue steadfastly with them.
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:47:01.440]   They continue daily with one accord with these people, because they've now got their eye
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:06.560]   on something beyond this world and something greater than this world.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.160]   They've got the same hope.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.760]   They have come to evaluate this world as it is.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.600]   They know this world will never be perfect.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.720]   They used to think it would be.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:21.800]   Some of them may have been active politicians for that reason, thinking that by acts of
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:27.320]   parliament you could change men and change the world and change life and introduce and
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.880]   legislate the kingdom of God.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.200]   They've come to see you can't do it.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.440]   That doesn't mean of necessity that they cease to be politicians.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.000]   But they don't think of it as they used to.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.160]   They think of political action now merely as that which restrains the manifestations
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:50.840]   of evil and sin and makes life bearable and tolerable, but will never make the world perfect.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.680]   No, no, they've got a hope set before them.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.160]   They say we are but strangers and pilgrims in this world.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.040]   We used to think we settled down in it, and we tried our best to do so, and we thought
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.960]   of nothing but this life and this world.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.960]   No longer.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:09.920]   The Christian is a man who always knows he's a pilgrim, a stranger, a sojourner, a traveller.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:16.360]   He's on the road to eternity, to reality, to life that is life indeed, to glory, everlasting.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.000]   He's got his eye fixed on that, and all who are looking in the same direction inevitably
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   come together.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   They're travelling together.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.800]   It's inevitable.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:44.360]   But perhaps supremely and above everything else there is this.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.360]   They rejoice in the same Saviour.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.840]   This is the thing that ultimately brings them together and makes them one.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:55.840]   They're still different in their temperaments and in many other respects, but there is one
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:05.760]   thing in which they're always one, and that is in their attitude and in their relationship
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.640]   to him.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.840]   This is the Christian.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:22.320]   He is a man who says, "I am what I am by the grace of God," nothing else.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:32.680]   He says, "I was a miserable failure, I was blind, I was a fool, I was spiritually dead,
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:43.520]   I was defeated, but Christ loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:50.240]   He, the Son of God, while I was yet an enemy and a rebel against God, while even speaking
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:55.600]   and working against him, while opposed to him with all the bitterness of my being, he
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.080]   loved me in spite of it.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:07.120]   And he came into this world, and he took my sins upon him, he bore my punishment, he died
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:13.880]   my death, he rose again, and there he is in heaven, seated at the right hand of God, ever
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:17.360]   living to make intercession for me.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.720]   I have nothing to boast of."
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:27.320]   The apostle ended 1 Corinthians 1 by saying, "Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord."
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.320]   Why?
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:39.400]   Well, because we are of him in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness,
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.080]   sanctification, and redemption.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.080]   What is a Christian?
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:47.340]   A Christian is a man who has come to see that he is nothing, he is nobody, that he has got
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.760]   nothing of which to boast.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.680]   He used to boast like everybody else.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:58.720]   One man was proud of his appearance, another man was proud of his great brain, another
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.440]   man was proud of his gift of writing, another of his gift of speech, another was proud of
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:08.320]   his wonderful singing voice, another was proud of his philosophic understanding, another
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.360]   of his political acumen.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:17.320]   And so we were all proud and all boasting, proud of our possessions, proud of this and
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:23.100]   that, as the apostle Paul himself tells us he was before his conversion.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:27.720]   When a man becomes a Christian, all that is absolutely smashed.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:33.160]   And he says with Paul, "The things that were gained to me, them I count but loss for the
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.160]   sake of Christ.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:42.560]   Yea, I count all things but dung and refuse, that I might win Christ and be found in him,
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.120]   not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but the righteousness which is
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.880]   of God by faith in Jesus Christ."
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:59.320]   A Christian is a man who says, "I am nothing, I am a fool, I am a sinner, I am vile, I am
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.320]   rotten.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.940]   In me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing, and all the things I have got
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.600]   will all be soon rotting away to nothingness.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.680]   I am nothing, I have nothing."
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:18.640]   So I am what I am, by the grace of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:25.720]   "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life I now live in the flesh.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:31.840]   I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and who gave himself for me."
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.240]   What makes these people one?
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:36.680]   It's this, that they're all like that, they're all saying the same thing.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:41.480]   The divisions have gone, yes, but they're one, one in Christ, one in attributing to
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:47.960]   him the glory and the praise, one in saying that it is he alone who saves and has saved
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:54.580]   and will save, all looking to him, anxious to follow him, anxious to please him, resting
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:53:00.880]   their hope in him and in him alone.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:08.240]   So they continue steadfast in the apostles' doctrine about him, and in the apostles'
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:16.080]   fellowship around him, in breaking the bread in which they remind themselves of him, and
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:20.280]   in their prayers to him and the Father and the Holy Ghost.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.280]   What for?
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.880]   Oh, it comes to this, shall I end with a phrase.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:30.480]   Why do these people come together like this?
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:35.360]   Oh, let me be still more personal.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:41.440]   Why do I stand in this pulpit Sunday by Sunday?
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:46.440]   Forgive me, my dear friends, I don't talk about myself, I don't want to, but I never
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.440]   entered the ministry to make money.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:54.440]   I made much more money before I entered the ministry.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:58.880]   I didn't enter the ministry to make money.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.440]   I don't continue in the ministry to make money.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:09.000]   This idea that we are here just to get people, to get collections and so on, what a travesty
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   it is.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   No, no, I'm here for one reason only, that I'm here to tell men and women about this
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:26.320]   Christ of God, this blessed Savior, this new life which he gives, which lasts not only
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:29.560]   in this world, but through death and to eternity.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:33.640]   That's the reason, and it is the only reason.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:34.640]   Why do I go on?
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.120]   Why do I urge these things upon you?
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:47.660]   My only answer is this, we've all got to meet God.
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:51.800]   It cannot be avoided, it cannot be evaded.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:58.640]   We've all got to stand before God in judgment, and our eternal future depends upon whether
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.240]   we believe in this blessed person or not.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:07.160]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:15.560]   should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.640]   So I like to think of it like this.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.640]   What are we doing here?
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.560]   What do we do here Sunday by Sunday?
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:35.720]   I regard it like this, I am here and I preach this gospel in order that we may all prepare
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:42.840]   ourselves for that glory which is coming.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:49.960]   Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:59.240]   That's what I've got my eye on, heaven and God, all the glory, all the purity, all the
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:05.120]   holiness of it all, and time is short and time is hastening and time is passing.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:10.720]   I want to prepare every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:17.320]   is pure there isn't a moment to spare.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:23.040]   That's why they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and breaking
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.600]   of bread and prayer.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:29.760]   They'd come to see that nothing matters in this world finally but just that, and they
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.800]   wanted to know everything they could in order to be ready and prepared for it.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:40.200]   My dear friend, a Christian is bound to come to that.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.920]   How can you believe that you're a sinner?
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.320]   How can you believe in God?
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.760]   How can you believe in judgment?
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.100]   How can you believe in hell?
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.800]   How can you believe in the glory?
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   And, well, be content with just coming to church once on a Sunday, once a year, or just
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:59.040]   now and again, or not at all perhaps, and think that you're a good Christian though
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.440]   you don't come, better than those hypocrites who do.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:06.860]   The thing is just impossible, it's unnatural, it isn't an expression of this life.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:12.360]   This life of God must express itself in the way that it did immediately after the day
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:18.520]   of Pentecost in the way that it has continued to do ever since in those who are truly Christian.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:24.040]   All I'm asking you is this, how do you come out of these tests?
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.800]   It is rarely as simple as that.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:31.400]   I'm not interested in your opinions, I'm asking you this, have you got that in you which makes
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:39.360]   you desire the company and the companionship of people who've got their eye on the Lord
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.160]   Jesus Christ and the glory everlasting?
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.560]   That's the test.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:55.200]   Life shows itself, and that's how Christian life, spiritual life, the life of God in the
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:04.120]   soul has shown itself from the very beginning and must do so of necessity.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.440]   Have you got this life?
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:11.160]   If you haven't, listen, tell God that you haven't, do you want it?
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.720]   Ask him for it, he'll give it to you.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:21.600]   That's all you've got to do, repent, acknowledge and confess that you're dead, and ask him
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.760]   to give you life anew.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:30.560]   Ask him to do this glorious work of re-creation.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.280]   Ask him to send something of that divine life into you.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:38.360]   Ask him, truly, he'll do it for you.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:45.720]   And then you'll find yourself inevitably behaving as those first Christians did, immediately
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:52.160]   on the day of Pentecost.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.520]   Amen.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:59:03.840]   The closing hymn is hymn number 243-243, "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   God."
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   243.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:06.840]   (music)
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.840]   243.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.840]   (music)
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.840]   243.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:13.840]   243.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:14.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:14.840]   243.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:34.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.840]   243.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:36.840]   (music)
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:37.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:38.840]   243.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.840]   (music)
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:40.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:41.840]   243.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:41.840]   (music)
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:42.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:43.840]   243.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:44.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   243.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.840]   243.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:49.840]   243.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:50.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:51.840]   243.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:52.840]   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."
