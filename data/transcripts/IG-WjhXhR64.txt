[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   I've literally tried to monetize everything I love in this life.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.360]   And while that might sound like really creepy or cheesy, it works for me.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.320]   But I think it's like, what are the things that you enjoy?
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.520]   What are the things that people consider you an unofficial expert in?
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.600]   And what are the businesses or side hustles
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.880]   that you would want to spend all day Saturday and Sunday doing?
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.120]   Once you start to think about that, you might come closer to an idea.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.960]   The other thing to think about that I love to do is start tracking problems
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.440]   that you have every single day.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.160]   What are the many problems you have from the second you wake up
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.080]   till the time you go to sleep?
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.960]   Businesses are created because of problems need to be solved.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.280]   And if you start monitoring and figuring out what the common problems
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.800]   you or your friends have,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.480]   you might find yourself a really cool, untapped business idea.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.720]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.160]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.680]   Now, so many business leaders say that you should just focus on one thing
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.800]   and not spread yourself too thin on so many different projects
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.240]   and that the way to success is to laser focus on one goal, one product,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.520]   one business idea and tune everything else out.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.040]   But our guest today, Jen Glantz, throws all that advice out the window
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.000]   because she's an entrepreneur with multiple businesses,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.280]   multiple streams of income, and she thrives at doing it.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.240]   She started her first business, Bridesmaid for Hire,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.800]   after an ad she placed in Craigslist went viral.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.000]   But she's also written three books, over 1,500 articles for publications
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.560]   from Forbes to The Today Show to The Washington Post.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.360]   She hosts a podcast, You're Not Getting Any Younger,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.920]   which I had the pleasure of being a guest on a few weeks ago.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.280]   And if that's not enough, she has three newsletters, sells digital courses,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.440]   does professional coaching and speaking.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   And oh, she has her own game called the Newlywed Card Game.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.000]   I have no idea how she does it all.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.200]   So let's jump in and find out.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.120]   Jen, thank you for being here.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.520]   Well, Chris, thank you for having me.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.040]   I honestly forget all that I do until you just read that intro.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800]   And then I was like, wow, that is a lot.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.760]   That is a lot. But I'm really proud of it all.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.400]   My first question is just did you always think you would be someone
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.520]   that had all of these projects and businesses going on?
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.120]   In all honesty, I was that person at my full time job that couldn't just do my job.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.960]   I was working at a startup as a copywriter and I couldn't just write.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.240]   I had to know how the sales team was doing.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.360]   I wanted to know what a project manager was like.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.840]   I was always so curious about other things.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.040]   I was also the person at my full time job that did the whole job
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.320]   within like a couple of hours and had the rest of the day to do nothing.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.800]   And that's when I started writing a blog and started doing my all my own work
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.920]   while I was getting paid at my full time job.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.400]   So I always knew that I was never a person who wanted to do just one thing,
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.840]   but I never knew what I was going to ultimately do.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.880]   You know, I majored in poetry in college,
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.280]   so I feel like I set myself up for a life of question marks.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.320]   And when I graduated, I just knew I didn't want to live a standard life.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.120]   I didn't I knew I didn't want to be someone else's employee.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.720]   I knew I wanted so much more from myself,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.760]   but I didn't necessarily know where that journey would take me.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.240]   The first side hustle was Bridesmaid for Hire, right?
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.160]   Well, actually, I would say my first side hustle was a blog
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   I started in 2011 called The Things I Learned From.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.800]   And I wrote that blog.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.280]   I had no readers that grew and grew and grew.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.120]   And eventually that led to me getting a book deal.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.320]   And that led to me becoming a freelance writer.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.960]   So while I didn't necessarily make money off of the blog when I first started it,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.640]   it led to all of these different opportunities that propelled my journey.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.000]   And I started the blog because I was working a really bad job
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.400]   and nobody would publish my writing and I wanted to be a writer.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.560]   So I started this blog on WordPress.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.960]   And that was a game changer that set me up for so much more to come.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.320]   So I think one takeaway there is it doesn't have to be a business
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.680]   to necessarily become a business.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.240]   So if you're listening and you're thinking, "Oh, I have this thing.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.800]   I don't know how to make money from it."
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.080]   Your example here is you did this thing that made no money.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.440]   And now you have, I don't know, seven, eight different businesses
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.240]   and streams of income that kind of all came from that.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.120]   How did you know when to spend more time on the blog
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.840]   or any other project versus you had a day job?
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.400]   When I was working full time, I realized, "OK, you know,
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.280]   I don't necessarily need the income from other projects.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   So let me throw some things out there and see what sticks,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.640]   see what's going well."
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.120]   I've always been a person who likes to work on multiple things.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.560]   So I would wake up before work at 4 a.m., work on one project,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.520]   go to work and work on other projects at work, come home and do even more.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.200]   So I would literally take if I was working on three side hustles
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   and I would split my day to give each the same amount of time.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.000]   Now, there were some points when some blew up a little bit more
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.160]   and then I would spend weekends
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.000]   working on those and let the other ones fall behind.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.920]   But one thing I've always vowed to myself is that if I created something
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.000]   that had an audience, whether a podcast, a blog, a newsletter,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.720]   that I would not let them down.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.240]   And what I mean by that is I would never miss a day when I owed them content.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.840]   So my podcast comes out every Friday, my newsletter every Monday,
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.560]   and my blog used to come out every Tuesday.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.800]   I would never, ever, ever miss a day.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.360]   So if I had something with an audience, I always showed up for them
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.840]   no matter what, and I'm still that way.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.240]   And I think when you're building and growing, you need consistency.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.720]   That's everything in branding.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.760]   And as a content creator, that's what gives you your credibility,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.160]   especially early on.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.480]   I have a newsletter and it comes out every two weeks.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.600]   And I think I've only missed one.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.160]   And there were there's at least a good reason behind the one that missed.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.280]   But, you know, it forces me to not give it up because whether
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.120]   even if it's your passion, right, everyone always says, you know, for me,
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.680]   this podcast is a passion of mine, this newsletter is.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.560]   That doesn't mean that there are days where you're like, gosh, I just you know,
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.800]   I just need a break.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.440]   And I think the consistency forces you to keep going.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.520]   Otherwise, the break you take could go longer than you want.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.800]   And, you know, I think even fulfilling things can be hard.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah. And also when you're creating content, you want some sort of validation.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.480]   And I've learned early on as a writer, you're not going to get people
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.160]   who email you every week and say, good job, I love the show.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.920]   Like, that's a bonus.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.360]   But I think if you still really want to take this seriously,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.320]   you need validation in some sort of way.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.160]   And I have always found that in accountability and being my own
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.520]   accountability buddy.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.240]   So if I set deadlines, especially as an entrepreneur or a content creator,
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.480]   if I miss those deadlines, that's me failing myself.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.280]   And if I make those deadlines, that's validation, that's accountability.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.040]   And I've always been so firm on that, that me showing up
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.120]   is the only ticket I have to my own success.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.160]   Whether or not people are going to praise me for my content,
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.680]   it allows me to know that I'm doing the work I need to do.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.000]   That makes sense.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.720]   And I'll give a shout out to a listener here named Darshan, who sent me an email.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.240]   It was like, hey, I know most people write in and complain or ask questions.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.000]   I'm just writing in to say thank you.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.800]   And I was like, oh, man, feels really good to get those emails
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.840]   because, you know, a lot of mediums, podcasting, especially.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.280]   It's not really easily a two way street.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.640]   But now let's go back to this first first big, big break.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.120]   I guess you call it. Yeah.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.440]   You put this ad in Craigslist.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.480]   What led to you even posting the ad?
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.760]   Because it's not like there was a bridesmaids for hire business
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.480]   that you, you know, lots of people were doing
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.320]   and you just wanted to throw your hat in the ring.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.000]   The truth is, I had a really bad Friday night
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.520]   and I was rejected from an opportunity and I was feeling down about myself.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.000]   And before that, I had all of these friends
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   getting married in my early 20s and I was always a bridesmaid.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.200]   And that same night that I was feeling down about myself, I had two friends
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.920]   I hardly spoke to who ironically lived down the street.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.280]   Two of those people on that same Friday night called me up and said,
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.400]   hey, will you be my bridesmaid?
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.520]   It was so random.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.440]   I was feeling so down about myself.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.280]   I was venting to my roommate and I said, Carrie, like what is going on?
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.480]   And she said, Jen, come on, it's obvious these people are asking you
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.760]   because you're good at it.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.040]   You're like some sort of professional.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.360]   And I went home after she had gone out.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.720]   My roommate had gone out and I just sat there and I was like, you know what?
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.480]   I'm so sick of where I am in my life.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.560]   I'm so sick of feeling stuck.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.120]   I'm so fed up also about being a bridesmaid.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.680]   Let me do something about it.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.760]   If I'm good at this skill and I have distant friends asking me,
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.120]   why not allow strangers to hire me?
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.160]   I didn't know a thing about business.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.600]   I didn't know if this was going to work, but I said to myself, let me try it.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.760]   So I went to craigslist.com, which is a website my mom told me
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.200]   growing up, never, ever, ever go to.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.760]   And I posted the anonymous ad basically saying, hey, if you need help
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.640]   at your wedding as a bridesmaid, I'll be there.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.760]   I'll show up in the dress.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.720]   I'll walk down the aisle.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.280]   I'll dance with your weird uncle.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.440]   I'll give the speech.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.640]   I'll help you pee in your wedding dress, which is like actually a hard thing to do.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.120]   And I posted the ad.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.040]   I went to sleep.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.120]   I lived my life.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.600]   I didn't even check my email over the weekend.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.680]   I just figured, whatever.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.880]   Nobody saw this craigslist ad.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.640]   I go to work Monday morning and I see in my inbox.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.480]   I have hundreds of emails from people all over the world that wanted to hire me.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.400]   Let alone somebody in my office chatted me a link to a BuzzFeed
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.080]   news article about the ad saying, oh, my God, Jen, like this is you.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.360]   Like you're in BuzzFeed.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.840]   And my life literally changed over the course of a weekend
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.960]   without me even knowing it.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.120]   I have so many questions.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.920]   So I want to dig into both the business side of this.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.280]   But because I think very, very
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.120]   because I think most people don't understand this business,
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.600]   you know, you gave a bunch of great examples.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.160]   What can you just share a little bit about the role?
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.640]   Why people actually end up hiring you?
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.760]   Some surprising things you've learned.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.200]   You know, people hear this and they're like, this is so weird.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.280]   Who would want to hire you?
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.880]   And I'm like, OK, just give me a couple of seconds and I'll convince you.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.920]   Number one, it's not a wedding planner.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.840]   I don't help you pick your flowers or your dress or your venue.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.560]   I don't do any of that.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.000]   I am strictly your hired bridesmaid.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I'm there as the personal assistant running to CVS because you don't have tissues.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.800]   I'm the social director who plans the bachelorette party and makes it fun.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.280]   I'm the person who is the peacekeeper when the mother in law and you are fighting.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.360]   I come between that and break that off.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.840]   And I'm the on-call therapist.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.680]   I'm the one you can call at two in the morning and vent about how stressed
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.040]   you are about your wedding.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.840]   I am there for the people.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.160]   I'd say there's two types of people who hire me.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.320]   Type number one are people who have friends, but they need that professional
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.000]   embedded in their wedding party because their friends are a disaster
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   and they want someone who's going to keep the peace,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.080]   but also make sure they feel supported.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.480]   And on the flip side, I have the person who hires me
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.280]   because they don't have any friends.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.520]   And I know that sounds bizarre, but the truth is a lot of people out there
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.080]   don't have close, solid relationships.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.640]   And when you get married, you need that support system.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.000]   You need that person who's going to be there for you emotionally,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.560]   mentally and physically before your wedding and on the day of.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.120]   I am your bridesmaid.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.240]   So what does that mean?
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.600]   While I wear the dress, I walk down the aisle, I dance on the dance floor.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.520]   But aside from that, I also pretend to be a part of your life.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.800]   So oftentimes I have a fake name, a fake backstory,
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.080]   and nobody in your life knows I'm hired.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.600]   Sometimes not even the person you are marrying.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.040]   So I take on that role as your friend.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.120]   And I've been doing this for seven years.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.440]   People called it crazy.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.040]   Some people called it brilliant.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.160]   I always called it a must need.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.720]   And I remember doing my first wedding ever
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.240]   for for a woman named Ashley from Maple Grove, Minnesota.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.800]   I remember flying there, getting off the plane, thinking,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.880]   what are you about to do?
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.080]   You're about to show up at a stranger's wedding. Are you crazy?
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.080]   And when I got back on the plane to go back to New York,
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.200]   I remember thinking, Jen, this is something and this is something
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.960]   that's going to be incredibly important to so many people's lives.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.840]   And that's sort of why I started it and why I keep doing it till this day.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.640]   I want to go two directions here.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.280]   So I'll ask first, what are some of the kind of fun,
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.520]   surprising things you've seen or learned?
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.920]   I always say that I'm a person who never liked weddings.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.200]   I was never a person who planned a dream wedding.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.120]   I could never care about my own wedding.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.680]   I still don't like weddings.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.800]   I think why I do this job is because I love helping strangers
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.600]   in chaotic situations, and that's what weddings are.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:01.200]   I've learned so much about humans and love and relationship on this job
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.440]   that has completely reshaped how I think about humanity
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.720]   in both good ways and not so good ways.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.640]   You know, one thing I like to talk about that nobody really will mention
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.680]   is that cold feet is an absolute real thing
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.680]   that happens to very many people on their wedding day.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.880]   I call it the diving board effect,
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.320]   where right before they're about to walk down the aisle,
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.920]   they know whether or not they're making a mistake.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.400]   And these are people who might not have known before,
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.320]   but in that moment, they know if you ask a lot of people
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.240]   who got divorced within the first year or so after their wedding,
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.960]   they will tell you they knew in that moment they were making a mistake.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.560]   And this is something so fascinating because a big part of my job
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.520]   is helping people when they have cold feet,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.960]   whether a week before, a month before or five minutes before.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.560]   So watching cold feet, something that you only see on TV,
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.280]   actually be real was incredibly fascinating to me
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.320]   and difficult to handle at first.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.200]   The other thing that I've learned, too,
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   which is a little different and difficult to mention
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.400]   is that a lot of people don't get married for love.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.440]   A lot of people get married for love and something else.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.840]   Pretty much all of us get married for love and something else.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.400]   Some people don't get married for love at all,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.320]   but some people get married for the and part,
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.920]   which might be financial security or might be because that person
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.000]   is going to provide them with a certain lifestyle
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.920]   or because they're at a certain age.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.520]   And this is just what they want to do.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.240]   And I have heard a lot of people admit to me candidly what that and is.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.240]   And that was fascinating to me as well.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.040]   I always thought people just had like fairy tale romances.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.840]   And when I met my future husband back in the day,
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.520]   I started to realize that this was true.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.000]   You fall in love.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.680]   But what gets you to that finished line of marriage is always the end.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.360]   Whatever that part is, whether positive or negative.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.120]   And you said some people don't even have the love part.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.800]   How does that work out?
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.280]   You know, now you've been doing this long enough that you can see the end result.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.240]   You know, it's crazy because a lot of people will say
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.200]   you must be so good at knowing if a couple is going to make it.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.000]   But the truth is, you could never, ever, ever judge anybody else's relationship
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.200]   because people stay in relationships just like they enter relationships
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.240]   for different reasons.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.320]   So just because you think your friends out there are not going to make it,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.920]   whatever type of relationship
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.960]   they have might be exactly what they're looking for and what they want.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.560]   And it might be something so different than what you want.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.920]   So a lot of people who are getting married because they want that person's money
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.160]   or because of whatever that reason is, they end up do staying together.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.760]   And it's because they got what they wanted
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.960]   and the other person got what they wanted as well.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.640]   And while it might be very different than what I want, it works for them.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.800]   So I think it is so hard to know if a couple is going to make it.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.760]   When I played this game at weddings, the couples, I was like,
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.960]   oh, they're going to be together forever.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.360]   Two years in are divorced.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.400]   So you don't really know.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.080]   And I mean, it's fascinating because I have some of those thoughts
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.400]   in my head when, you know, that couple, you know, they argue a lot
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.440]   or all this stuff.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.200]   And, you know, so far, I'm not anywhere close
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.360]   to being predictive of that behavior.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.160]   Yeah, it might be their communication style.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.680]   Like, I can't tell you the amount of couples that right before
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.600]   they walked down the aisle, they're screaming at each other, they're cursing.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.360]   And while that's like not healthy and not good, that's their communication style.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.480]   That's how they work.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.040]   And for some odd reason, it just works for them.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.160]   Cold feet is one thing and then calling it off as another.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.360]   Has that ever happened?
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.040]   Many times.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.320]   I've actually been hired a couple of times to end engagements
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.400]   where the person had nobody in their life they could ask for that help from.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.720]   So they'll call me up and we'll talk about the steps
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.400]   they need to take to get out of the engagement
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.680]   because they're scared to tell their parents or they're scared
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.720]   to tell their friends and they need that unbiased support system.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.320]   But I've also been at weddings where they don't want to do it,
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.000]   where the bride tells me that she hates the groom and she wants out right now.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.800]   And my perspective, which is different than a friend or a family member,
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.880]   is I really want what's best for you.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.600]   Yeah, your friends and family want that, too.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.320]   But in the moment when the spotlight is on, they just don't want you to be embarrassed.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.520]   They just want you to, you know, do whatever you can do
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.000]   to just get this moment over with.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.800]   So I've had a lot of people who we've had to end the wedding.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.520]   I've had people who go through with the wedding,
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.320]   but they don't legally get married.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.360]   But that's happened a lot.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.560]   And that is not something
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.760]   I thought I'd have to deal with when I started the business.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.920]   This is wild.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.080]   And what you said, you've learned a lot about relationships.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.560]   Obviously, you haven't learned how to predict divorce.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.960]   But what are things that, you know, you've learned about relationships
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.480]   that people listening could apply to their own relationship?
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.480]   I always thought because of this job, I would never want to get married anymore
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.160]   just because I've seen so much.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.320]   And when I started dating my now husband, I said to him after he proposed,
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.880]   we're going to do things differently.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.400]   And I wasn't talking about the wedding.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.480]   I was talking about what we had to do before we got married.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.760]   I wanted to make sure we had all the checks and balances in place
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.480]   so that I knew that this was the right move for my life.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.560]   So I made us meet with a divorce lawyer to talk about prenups
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.640]   and what that would look like.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.240]   And if we want one, we didn't end up getting one.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.680]   But I can absolutely see why that's so important.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.320]   And you can get a postnum, which I never knew about.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.320]   We talked to a financial advisor to talk about what we should do
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.160]   with our finances, and we didn't end up combining finances.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.360]   But we went through the process of understanding that.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.000]   We went to a marriage counselor to talk about why marriages fail.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.120]   I literally was like, if you want to marry me,
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.080]   we are meeting with all of these professionals that people meet with
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.840]   once the marriage starts to go downhill before we get married.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.600]   And I wanted us to have education on what marriages and what changes
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.520]   and all of these things.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.360]   And while he was like so freaked out and was just like,
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.560]   can't you be normal and enjoy our engagement?
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.080]   It helped me feel prepared.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.520]   And I think a lot of couples have conversations,
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.560]   but they don't really go through these motions before they get married
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.400]   because nobody tells you it's OK to or that you should.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.360]   Everybody in life sets you up to find love.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.800]   They teach you how to date.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.000]   Everyone helps you plan a wedding, but nobody helps you once you get married.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.880]   You're just supposed to figure it out.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.960]   And I didn't want us to figure it out.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.480]   And that was something I've learned from the job is before you get married,
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.440]   go through a lot of these really tough conversations.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.560]   And then once you get married, things might be a little easier for you.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.760]   Even if you are married and haven't haven't gotten into them, right?
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.320]   Let's say you're thinking about having kids.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.680]   You could go talk to a marriage counselor and say, hey,
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.280]   what are the problems that we're going to face when this happens?
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.040]   What do you see?
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.120]   And what can we do now to find out how we would handle them
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.320]   and how we could do better?
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.120]   You know, we're proactive with so many things in our life that matter,
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.160]   like our health or sometimes our careers.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.440]   But we're not always so proactive with relationships.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.080]   And that's what I've really tried to be with.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.600]   My partner is we don't really have a ton of big problems now.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.960]   We have our standard problems.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.120]   But what can we know so that when we start to get into those problem areas,
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.720]   we know the tools that we can turn to and we know what to do.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.080]   We're by no means perfect.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.160]   But I think a combination of therapy and curiosity and meeting
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.480]   with a lot of these professionals has really helped us
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.720]   at least have these conversations in a neutral playing field
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.280]   rather than an awkward, hey, things are getting a little bad between us.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.200]   What should we do now?
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   Because it's very hard to rise to the occasion
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.120]   when your relationship is starting to go downhill.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.440]   So getting back to the business side of this,
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.120]   what advice do you have for someone trying to figure out
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.760]   what could be their side hustle?
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.240]   I think the important thing is think about what you're getting asked
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.920]   to do constantly in your life.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.200]   What are your friends asking you for help with?
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.280]   What are the things that you're spending your quality time doing?
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.640]   And if that's just reading different Reddit boards or reading certain books
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.640]   or watching certain TV shows or caring about certain hobbies,
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.720]   what are those things and can you monetize them?
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.880]   I've literally tried to monetize everything I love in this life.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.240]   And while that might sound like really creepy or cheesy,
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.320]   it works for me, but I think it's like, what are the things that you enjoy?
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.520]   What are the things that people consider you an unofficial expert in?
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.080]   And what are the businesses or side hustles that you would want to spend
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.880]   all day, Saturday and Sunday doing?
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.120]   Once you start to think about that, you might come closer to an idea.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.960]   The other thing to think about that I love to do is start tracking problems
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.440]   that you have every single day.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.160]   What are the many problems you have from the second you wake up
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.040]   till the time you go to sleep?
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.960]   Businesses are created because of problems need to be solved.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.280]   And if you start monitoring and figuring out what the common problems
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.840]   you or your friends have,
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.560]   you might find yourself a really cool, untapped business idea.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.920]   And where are you tracking these?
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.920]   Are you writing business ideas and problems down in a notebook?
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.840]   What's your method?
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.960]   I'm a paper and pencil kind of person.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.200]   I don't really like a lot of technology and apps.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.080]   If you saw my desk right now, I have a stack of papers and I use that.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.640]   There's also a great website called Notepad, Notepad.pd, I think.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.000]   It started by James Alcantara.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.320]   It's notepad.com, where you can write 10 ideas a day and people.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.160]   It's like a community.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.800]   They can comment on it and it's free and people can add to your idea list.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.160]   You can scan a site like that or read it or other places
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.880]   and write down a list of so many business ideas
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.920]   just on what people are venting about.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.480]   When I think about how to expand Bridesmaid for Hire,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.440]   I often go on wedding forums or in wedding Facebook groups,
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.080]   and I just read what problems people have and how they're trying to solve them.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.960]   And then I think of a digital product
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.120]   or something that I could offer that taps into that.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:00.200]   How did you first decide how much to charge someone to be their bridesmaid?
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.840]   And there wasn't a market for it.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.120]   I'm going to be so honest with you.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.280]   I was a poetry major. I was working at a startup.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.400]   I had no idea.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.040]   I literally, when the ad went viral, I went on national TV, live TV,
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.880]   and they asked me how much this cost.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.360]   And I said, "Cost? This is a free service.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.200]   I want to do this for free."
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.880]   And my brother, who's like in the business world, was like,
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.120]   "What did you just do? And this is not going to be free."
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.760]   And to be honest with you, I didn't know how much to charge,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.960]   but I found a different type of vendor in the wedding industry
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.120]   that I was closest to.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.240]   So I looked at wedding planners and day of coordinators and were very different.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.960]   But I looked at their pricing model.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.120]   I saw how much they charged, how they structured their packages.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.960]   And I modeled it off of that.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.480]   Even then, my pricing was far too low.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.320]   And after I worked a ton of weddings, I would come home and raise my prices
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.640]   by five dollars, ten dollars just because I was exhausted.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.680]   So I think pricing is something that will take time to figure out.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.080]   But you can do research.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.280]   Look at any other competitors that you have.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.280]   Figure out who your target audience is so you can match a price
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.880]   to your target audience and how much disposable income
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.640]   they might have to spend on your product or your service.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.560]   And the other thing to start to figure out is your operating costs.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.560]   You know, a lot of my operating costs are my time spent on these phone calls
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.160]   or me getting to the wedding or my downtime when I'm not working in the wedding
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.240]   or also, you know, being out on my own.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.880]   I have to pay health insurance and all of these things can factor into your pricing.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.840]   But I was the one that, you know, never had any business training,
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.280]   any advice on what to do.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.360]   I have learned and all of my success that I have had
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.160]   is because of all of the mistakes that I have made on my own costly mistakes.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.240]   And if you went back in time,
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.160]   where would you start setting your price now if you could do it all over again?
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.040]   If I could go back in time, I would say to myself, Jen,
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.160]   even though you don't think you are worth this price, let me tell you,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.920]   you don't know your worth because you are too deep in the business to know better.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.440]   So I want you to double, if not triple what you were charging.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.240]   I think I first started off in 2014, charging under a thousand dollars
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.200]   for this service, which is ludicrous because of the amount of time
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.000]   and energy and resources that go into this.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.520]   And now I'm closer to the three thousand dollar mark,
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.640]   which I think for the baseline package, which I think is a really good price
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.320]   for the service.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.040]   So I wish I would have tripled my price and said, you know what, Jen,
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.400]   you might not feel like this is what you should charge,
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.680]   but the value you're giving is extraordinary and people will pay it.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.200]   We're always so scared that if we raise our prices
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.640]   or we price something higher than competitors, nobody will come to us.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.520]   But that's where branding and marketing and sales tools come into play.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.560]   And I wish I had the confidence to do that.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.400]   And I'll be honest with you, even now, I'm so scared to raise my prices.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.880]   I had a client, I do made of honor speech writing,
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.680]   and I had a client say at the end of working with me,
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.600]   I just want to let you know you are completely under charging.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.560]   You should triple your prices.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.800]   And I said to her, wow, I appreciate that feedback.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.840]   But inside, I'm a bit of a scaredy cat because that price point's working for me.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.720]   I'm getting business.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.760]   If I raise it, I might lose business.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.160]   So even till this day, it's a confidence issue more than anything else.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.560]   And so do you think you're going to raise your prices
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.240]   now that you've had that feedback?
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   Absolutely, because not only did a client have to tell me,
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.960]   but I've had business mentors and just friends tell me that I'm charging too little.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.440]   And I think it took the words of a client to make me think, you know what?
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.840]   I asked her, OK, how much would you pay?
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   So I think that's good feedback is once you've worked with clients
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.080]   or you've had people buy your product is to send out a survey and say, hey,
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.200]   how much would you have paid for this and get their honest advice?
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.720]   And have you changed your price since?
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.800]   That's to be honest with you, this phone call was two days ago
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.440]   and I haven't changed it since, but I'm working on it.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.000]   I'm working on it. OK.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.360]   That's a good question. I like it.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.600]   I need this accountability, Chris. This is good.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.720]   Well, why don't you just commit to change the price before the end of the weekend?
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.600]   I'm going to because I'm launching a new website for Bridesmaid for Hire.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.920]   And I'm going to go. I'm going to go do it.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.120]   I'm not going to triple it.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:54.680]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.200]   I'm not going to triple it, but I will tack on a couple hundred.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.440]   When it comes to marketing,
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.160]   not everyone will launch a crazy side hustle and go on national television
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.280]   in a matter of days.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.400]   So let's shelve that tactic.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:11.040]   But you've launched a lot of other lines of business side hustles, sources of income.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.600]   What advice do you have for people who to just get them out there?
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.800]   I think number one is you have to think about how to be different.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.000]   There's so many people out there who are starting another podcast,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.160]   another wedding business, another this, another that.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.920]   Your branding, your voice, everything has to be different.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.880]   You have to differentiate yourself from all of the noise.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.120]   If not, the marketing is going to feel impossible.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.440]   So think about how you can do things differently,
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.080]   how you can do things like nobody else has done them before.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.000]   Number two, tap into any resources that are currently
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.800]   where your audience are spending a ton of time.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.520]   There's so many people right now who are so against TikTok
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.800]   because they think it's for the young people or whatever.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.760]   But the truth is, everyone's on TikTok.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.160]   TikTok is the fastest growing way that you can blow up right now for free.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.000]   Not even spending a penny.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.600]   Tap into that.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.760]   When we're doing marketing, we all look for a downloadable plan
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.280]   off the Internet of what we can do to market ourselves.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.920]   And that downloadable plan will tell you Instagram, Facebook ads.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.960]   None of that is going to work because it's oversaturated
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.360]   and your growth rate will be very, very low.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.720]   Go to the places that are new, that are fresh,
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.680]   that your audience is spending a lot of time on.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.920]   Number two, press is great because it gets the word out there for you for free.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.440]   So it's like advertising, but you don't have to pay for it.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.040]   How do you do your own press?
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.080]   There's two free websites that everybody should sign up for
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.280]   because they're absolutely free and the press comes to you.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.800]   What I mean by that is every day
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.720]   you'll get a list of sources that news reporters need to talk to.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.480]   And if you are a source, you'll end up in these articles for free.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.200]   One of those websites is called Help A Reporter Out dot com,
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.120]   and the other is called Quoted, Q-W-O-T-E-D.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.280]   The press is coming to you.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.960]   So get on those two websites as a source.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.760]   Press is great again because it spreads your name.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.800]   You don't have to pay for it.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.200]   So that's a good marketing channel.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.360]   Social media is good
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.320]   as long as you're not doing social media like everybody else,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.200]   because most people are doing it wrong.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.360]   And the third way is to create some sort of free value content stream
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.720]   rather than just be a business, be a brand.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   You also have to be a content creator.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   So consider a newsletter, consider a podcast, consider a video series,
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.760]   but make it fresh, make it interesting, make it something
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.600]   where after the person reads it, watches it or listens to it,
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.680]   they walk away and go, whoa, I cannot stop thinking about that.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.040]   How do you find that idea?
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.320]   Because I think it's easy to say,
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.640]   write something that people stop in their tracks when they see.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.200]   But, you know, you're a writer.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.640]   What what tips do you have for someone who's like, I don't know what that is?
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.240]   You need to wear the shoes of your audience
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.760]   because a lot of times we start businesses and brands for people who aren't us
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.080]   or who were just one of that audience.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.280]   So you need to embed yourself with that audience.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.080]   Number one, join Facebook groups, Slack channels, Discord groups
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.160]   where your audience hangs out and virtually stalk them.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.720]   Read what they're talking about.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.160]   Read how they're saying things.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.680]   Read what problems they have.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.520]   Get to know them from that level.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.040]   And that will really help you feel like you start to understand
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.080]   who you're marketing to and who you're talking to.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.040]   Next, look at all your competitors and what they're doing.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.320]   Find the similarities in what they're doing and try to do the opposite,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:24.320]   because you will be surprised how doing the opposite of what they're doing
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.880]   might give you traction and might impress your audience
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.000]   in a really unique kind of way.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.080]   The third thing to think about is what can you put out there
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:38.240]   that is going to let people feel smarter, more inspired and entertained?
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.720]   All good content has that in there.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.560]   So if you're not sure, think number one.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.600]   OK, what will my audience need to hear or read
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.240]   that would let them feel smarter about this topic?
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.440]   So if you're selling mattresses, OK, what would your audience
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.080]   need to know about mattresses that would make them feel that way?
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.400]   What would they need to know that would make them entertained and inspired?
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.320]   And if we can start to answer these questions, what we're putting out there
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.640]   will attract the people we want to attract.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.880]   That's fantastic.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.400]   How did you end up making the decision to take this thing
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.360]   that you started on a whim on a Friday afternoon and say, OK, I've done this.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.480]   I used to think I should do it for free. I'm getting paid.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.480]   Now this is my full time business.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.200]   This is this is me.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.880]   I'm not going to look for a day job.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.680]   I'm not going to look for, you know, steady W2 income.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.520]   I'm going all in on myself.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.920]   I was a bit of a coward, I guess, because I really didn't.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.640]   I waited till I was laid off from my full time job.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.720]   I'll never forget my boss calling me in and said, we're having a massive layoff
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.200]   and I'm letting you go first because I don't think you should be here anymore.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.480]   And I remember being devastated by that because I love the steady stream of income.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.160]   Again, I did my job so quick.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.120]   I did it really well.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.640]   And I had all the free time in the world and I was getting paid like,
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.080]   I don't know, $70,000 to do it back then.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.120]   So I was so devastated.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.640]   And I remember packing my bags and exiting the door.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.720]   And as the front door hit me in the behind, I said to myself, Jen,
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:04.000]   you are never going to work for somebody else ever again, ever again.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.560]   And to make that happen, we will figure out what we have to do to pay our bills.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.600]   And I went home and I devised a plan that said, OK,
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.760]   we're going to take Bridesmaid for Hire to the next level.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.360]   We'll figure out what that means.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.680]   We're also going to tap into the other little side
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.640]   hustles that you had sort of done when you worked full time,
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.120]   like freelance writing and book writing and all of these things.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.400]   And we're going to make it work.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.160]   We're going to figure it out.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.240]   But that was the moment where I said, I can't work for somebody else
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.080]   because you know what? I'm not a good employee.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.480]   I don't want to just do my job. I want to do other things.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.760]   And I will never be happy in a corporate environment.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.960]   And I made that decision.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.440]   And honestly, in full honesty and transparency, it is not easy
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.320]   because every month I have a certain income goal of what I want to make.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.960]   And sometimes you don't hit that and sometimes you do.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   And it's very inconsistent and it's hard.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.440]   One month, you know, one side hustle or one business is taking off
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.440]   and the rest are failing.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.320]   And during the pandemic, all of them are failing and you start to panic.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.440]   So it's definitely a lifestyle where you are on your toes.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.520]   And some days you find yourself thinking, huh,
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.640]   would it be easier just to collect a paycheck?
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.040]   And I do think that sometimes.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.640]   But I just know that my happiness lies in me
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.120]   being able to run wild and free with these crazy ideas.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.320]   When you were deciding Bridesmaids for Hire, let's let's make this a thing.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.920]   You mentioned you also looked at, OK, well, let's what about writing?
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.320]   And books did a part of you say, what if Bridesmaids for Hire
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   could just be the one thing?
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.520]   I always thought that Bridesmaids for Hire would never be the only thing
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.360]   because that would make me happy.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.800]   I am somebody who has known from a very early age
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.600]   that there's two categories of things that I am meant to do.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.720]   One of them is right in any capacity.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.240]   I've known since I was four years old, I wanted to be a writer.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.840]   And the other is speak to inspire.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.200]   I've always wanted to be this inspirational speaker.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.840]   So when I started Bridesmaids for Hire, I sort of turned
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.720]   both of those things into the gig.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.320]   I wrote made of honor speeches and I spoke and I inspired and I helped people.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.680]   But I always knew I had to do other things with those passions.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.200]   My other passion was always being able to support people in a way
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.920]   that they were when they were going through really challenging situations.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.080]   That's always been my target.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.400]   Audience are people who are not feeling great about their lives
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.240]   and me being that person that could hopefully pick them up.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.960]   So knowing that those are my passions always led me to figure out other things.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.600]   But no, I never thought Bridesmaids for Hire would be my only thing
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.480]   because it wouldn't make me happy.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.520]   Two of the side hustles you spun up, probably because of the passions
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.600]   you just talked about were coaching and speaking.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.800]   And I hear a lot of people talk about, you know, I like advising people.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.080]   Coaching would be fun.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.920]   Some people turn that into a full time gig.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.840]   But how did you even get started in those two areas?
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.760]   And what advice do you have for people who are interested in them?
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.000]   I remember graduating college with a poetry degree
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.040]   and people would ask me what I wanted to do next.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.120]   And I said, I want to be a motivational speaker.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.480]   And so many mentors and people older than me were like, cool,
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.880]   but you have nothing to speak about.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.800]   You're 22. You haven't lived a life.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.680]   And I was offended by that because I thought I had lived a life at 22.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.280]   But perhaps they were right.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.480]   But as I built my career, as I got laid off, as I built Bridesmaids for Hire,
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.680]   as I wrote books, as I did all of these things,
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.840]   I felt like I had more life experiences.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.480]   And that led to a lot of people knocking on my door and asking for help
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.200]   and asking for advice and asking how to launch this or that.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.040]   And I decided rather than doing these one off free chats
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.280]   or rather than, you know, speaking and teaching at a school,
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.040]   why not offer coaching so it can be more personalized?
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.720]   So I think I got the confidence to offer coaching as a service
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.640]   once I started to get a steady stream of maybe ten plus people a month
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.800]   reaching out for some sort of help.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.640]   And I got to do more speaking just by figuring out, OK, what was my keynote?
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.680]   What was I going to bring to the table at all of these conferences?
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   And a lot of what I spoke about was how to take a crazy idea
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.120]   and turn it into a side hustle or how to market using no money
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.760]   or how to do your own PR.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.520]   I tapped into all of these skills
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.040]   that I figured out by starting Bridesmaid for Hire and running with it.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.360]   So I guess that person at 22 was right.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.160]   I really didn't know what to speak about or coach back then.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.680]   But through these experiences, I built the confidence to sort of launch that.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.280]   And these are things I still do till the till this day.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.920]   And some seasons are busier and some seasons aren't.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.320]   And that's the cool thing about juggling multiple streams of income,
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.720]   multiple side hustles, is that some seasons you'll run with three
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.440]   out of seven of them and then the other season that will change.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.000]   That's both stressful and exciting.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.560]   And that summarizes, I really believe, my personal life and journey
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.520]   as an entrepreneur.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.680]   Before I do any interview, I like to go find an episode of a podcast
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.240]   where someone's been interviewed and just kind of get a sense of their vibe.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.320]   And I saw a bunch of you on one show and I was like, gosh,
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.720]   why is she going on the James Altucher show so many times?
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.560]   And so I looked and you started this coaching series
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.200]   where you kind of publicly were being coached.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.880]   And it was called Make You a Millionaire.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.840]   And in the first episode, I only listen to the first one so far.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.200]   You know, the goal was in six to 12 months, you were going to go through
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.760]   this coaching series and, you know, build your business up.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.960]   How has that gone? What have you learned?
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.480]   I've been a fan of James Altucher for so many years.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.200]   I've loved his style.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.000]   I saw somewhere that he had posted he was taking on these mentorees
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.440]   for his podcast, and I wrote an email, I reached out.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.080]   I never thought I'd hear back from him.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   I got an email within a couple of minutes being accepted to the show.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.160]   We filmed the next day.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.400]   I opened up my entire life on that episode.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.320]   And I remember thinking, what did I just do?
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.800]   I was so nervous because I figured a huge audience of people would hear it.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.680]   I was so vulnerable in a way I had never been before.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.800]   And frankly, I was quite terrified.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.680]   Not only that, but if you know James, you know that he has a lot of ideas,
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.520]   big ideas, scary ideas, things I've never done before.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.640]   And I wanted to do everything that he said because I really did view him
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.000]   as that mentor.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.680]   So he threw me into a world where I was already doing so much.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.640]   And now he gave me five other things to start to do.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.880]   He had me start two newsletters, a product, all of these things.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.760]   And it was a complete game changer.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.160]   Did I make a million dollars from any of it?
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.600]   No. Am I close to that? No.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:09.760]   But what it did help me figure out is other places and other things
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.240]   to tap into that I normally never, ever would have thought to do
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.440]   or would have thought about.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.600]   I'm somebody who for the past seven years, I've been my own boss.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.960]   I'm a team of one.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.480]   I am the brainpower of everything I do.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.240]   And sometimes that's not enough or that's stale.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.920]   But listening to somebody say, hey, do this, do this, do this, do this
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.360]   got me out of a funk and forced me into all of these different worlds
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.720]   that taught me something new.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.200]   I learned how to use Substack.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.560]   I launched a product on Kickstarter.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.440]   I created a card game, something I'd wanted to do, but had no idea what to do.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.360]   I created a website where people can be human billboards.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.400]   Like I just did everything.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.320]   And I felt like I had no risk because I almost felt like
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.720]   I was doing these things to show him.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.560]   And it was almost like a fun experiment.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.160]   So I felt risk free.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.960]   Whereas in my own life, taking those risks is harder
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.800]   because I'm always so worried about making money.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.960]   So I start to sort of put those risks aside
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.040]   and focus on things that are going to make me money.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.840]   But working with him on this podcast and this experiment
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.840]   forced me to try new things that I hadn't done in a while.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.800]   I want to ask about a few of them, because, you know, Kickstart
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.280]   is a great example.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.680]   You know, everyone listening has probably found some interesting project there.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.600]   What would you say about that experience?
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.760]   If someone has an interesting idea of something to build, would you?
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.000]   Was that a good, positive experience?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   I really liked the Kickstarter platform in the sense of
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.640]   it gives you a great landing page.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.480]   You can film a video about your product.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.000]   You could offer different tiers.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.120]   And it's a great place to send people to to hopefully invest in your product.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.120]   And if you reach the goal, you have the product will get made
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.040]   and they'll get the product they bought.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.560]   And if you don't, they get their money back.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.840]   So it's a little bit risk free for your audience.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.480]   However, what I am learning about everything in life
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.760]   is just because you're on a website like Kickstarter or you're on a website,
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.360]   you know, like another type of website like that,
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.680]   it doesn't mean you're going to get organic traffic.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.760]   So you still have to market no matter what you start in this world,
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.400]   whether you release a podcast, a book, a product, a business.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.800]   Having a marketing, having marketing skills is so essential.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.840]   So the Kickstarter was great for a lot of those resources.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.080]   But I still had to do a ton of hands on marketing.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.520]   I still had to think about how am I going to make this go viral?
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.160]   I still had to figure out how to post this on Instagram
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.040]   or talk about on the podcast or get people to share it in order to get people
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.920]   to that page that was all me and not so much Kickstarter.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.760]   And I think a lot of people think if you have a Kickstarter page,
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.800]   that Kickstarter will send you traffic.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.760]   And that could be true, especially if you have a very viral idea
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.880]   or a really awesome video that could happen.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.640]   But for me, it required a lot of marketing.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.200]   I liked it because it gave me the confidence to produce a product
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.520]   that I was very, very scared to release.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.560]   It also gave me the funds to go off
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.040]   and release it without having to tap into my own money.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.360]   So there were a lot of benefits to releasing something on Kickstarter.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.880]   Also, all I needed was a proof of concept as I got the Kickstarter up and running.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.560]   That's when I designed the card deck.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.840]   That's when I wrote the cards.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.440]   That's when I figured out how to produce it.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.640]   So it gave me some lead time to actually put it out there in the world.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.920]   And it's out there like you hit your goal and that people can buy the cards.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.200]   I doubled the goal.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.480]   I funded it 200 percent, which was cool.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.960]   And I've released the card game.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.800]   I'm practically sold out with the first release of it.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.000]   I'm reordering it right now.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.400]   It's been an amazing, amazing thing to do
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.560]   because I've always wanted to create a physical product.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.920]   My entire career has been services or books or nothing like a product of my own.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.640]   And creating this card deck was the first one that I've done.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.240]   And it's a cool learning experience.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.640]   I'm learning how to sell on Amazon.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.880]   I'm learning how to talk to retailers and get it there.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.280]   I'm learning about e-commerce.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.200]   Like I'm learning about all of these things that I've always wanted to learn,
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.600]   but I didn't have an excuse to.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.440]   And that was the cool part about working with James is he gave me an excuse
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.920]   to learn different softwares and platforms and put out different ideas out there
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.640]   that I think I would have been too scared to do.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.240]   You know, if you're a person who wants to start a side hustle
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.680]   or you want to go out on your own and be an entrepreneur,
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.920]   people always talk about the importance of having mentors and people to turn to.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.200]   And I never really had any of that.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.800]   But you get to points in your career where it's so essential
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.600]   because your brain can only take you so far
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.560]   and feeding off of the ideas of people you trust,
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.760]   whether they're in your industry or not, can really help
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.600]   you get out of a certain place where your brain is locked.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.880]   I've been fortunate to have mentors throughout my career,
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.720]   but oftentimes they're not necessarily people that you might think are mentors.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.520]   Like one of my closest friends is a mentor for a certain area of my life.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.320]   And I would say don't always write off who could be a mentor,
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.960]   because sometimes what you need is just someone with a different perspective.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.600]   And that doesn't need to always be someone who's done it a thousand times.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.280]   You know, it could just be someone you whose opinion you respect.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.160]   And oftentimes, I personally think the most valuable
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.120]   trait of a mentor is that you respect their opinion,
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.720]   because if you don't respect their opinion, a lot of their feedback
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.280]   isn't going to be taken to heart.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.240]   And if you're not going to take the feedback,
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.600]   then the relationship doesn't always work.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.120]   I like how you said for you have a mentor for a certain part of your life.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.360]   And I find that to be true.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.600]   My first my true first ever mentor, and I write about this in my book,
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.160]   was an 86 year old man that I met on the Internet
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:23.480]   because I Googled free business help and I found this guy met him at a library.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.680]   He's an 86 year old man.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.040]   He didn't even know what a bridesmaid was.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:32.080]   And I realized I went back to him every single Saturday for two years.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.720]   I realized I wasn't going to him for business advice
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.160]   because frankly, he wasn't giving me that.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.440]   But he was mentoring me and had to be tough.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.520]   And he was mentoring me and how to have mental strength and resilience
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.800]   and how to stand up for myself
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   and how to have really tough conversations in the business world.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.400]   And I was going to him for different reasons.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.800]   I thought I was going to him for how to scale a business and write a business plan.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.600]   But truthfully, what I got out of him was something I never knew I needed.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.640]   But during that time got me through that.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.560]   And I think it's the same thing with James.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.360]   Like I started the podcast with him because I needed business advice.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.600]   But really, what he taught me is how to have fun, how to have experiments,
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.280]   how to think outside of the box, like things I was greatly missing in my life.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.560]   So you're right.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.520]   Don't write off people.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.120]   And sometimes find a mentor who knows nothing about your industry,
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.240]   nothing about what you're doing, because you might take so much from them
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.000]   that somebody who's a seasoned vet and what you're doing
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.280]   might pass over and not even know to tell you.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.080]   So what were the lessons
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.200]   from this man about grit and resilience that made that possible?
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.360]   I found that, you know, early on when I started Bridesmaid for Hire,
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:39.480]   I was in all of these different negotiations and business contract meetings.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.160]   And I was trying to pitch a TV show.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.000]   And I was so scared to stand up for what I wanted.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.880]   And I remember we would do a lot of role playing.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.000]   And one time he got out his keys and he said to me,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.840]   if you're ever in a negotiation
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.360]   and they don't like what you're bringing to the table or they say no to you,
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:00.360]   you just drop your keys and you say to them basically like, that's my final offer.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.680]   If you decline it, I'm picking up these keys and I'm never speaking to you again.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.560]   I mean, this was a really tough guy, and maybe some of his advice
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.320]   wasn't like so perfect, but it really toughened me up.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:15.600]   And it showed me that I need to figure out how to push my scaredness away
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.080]   and my fear away and step up to these conversations like I've been there before.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.840]   And like I know how much value I'm bringing.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.760]   I'm somebody who you might not realize this from hearing me on podcasts,
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.040]   but I'm really shy, like in real life.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.760]   I'm really, really shy.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.440]   So when I found myself in a lot of these business conversations,
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.800]   I had imposter syndrome.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.880]   I was just shy.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.240]   I didn't think I was good enough.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.280]   And this guy, I think, really toughened me up.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.960]   And through role playing, he would fix my language.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.480]   He would fix my body language.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.760]   And he would really just teach me how to bring myself there
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.520]   in a room, sometimes the people who scared me like crazy.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.200]   And it's really made me, I swear to you, till this day,
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.840]   I could walk in a room of anybody, the most famous person in the world.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.000]   And I won't let it faze me.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.080]   You would never know that I'm scared.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.840]   He's taught me how to not be intimidated, which is something really
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.440]   that was really hard for me to learn as a person who's just naturally really shy.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.600]   Everybody intimidates me always.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:14.520]   So what would you do if you were walking in to a room to meet the president?
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.080]   Is there something you would do in advance to prepare
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.680]   to kind of prepare? Yeah.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.600]   I always do my body language warm up.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.160]   So I always make sure that I drink a lot of water.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.040]   But I also remember I always tell myself, OK, keep your shoulders back
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.880]   because the more your shoulders are back, the more you open your chest up,
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.160]   the more you can breathe and the more you show confidence.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.600]   I always remember to keep my hands controlled
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.720]   because that shows that you are controlled.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.040]   So I'll keep my hands either at my belly button or by my waist.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.400]   And sometimes I'll hold my hands together.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.960]   And then the final thing is because you can learn about how anybody feels about you
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.480]   based on where their chin is.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.200]   If someone's chin is down, they're completely terrified by you.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.520]   They're intimidated by you.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.360]   If their chin is up, you find this air of confidence.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.200]   So I'll walk in the room, shoulders back, my chin up, my hands controlled.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.280]   I won't be shaking my body side to side.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.760]   I'll be relatively still.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.960]   I'll look the person in the eye and I won't show any kind of extreme emotion.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.360]   I'm somebody in real life where I'm very enthusiastic.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.760]   But when I meet somebody who I'm intimidated by, I'll tone that down.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.160]   And and I won't show that enthusiasm.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.600]   And why that is, is because I want them to know that I came there
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:24.320]   with a serious reason or I came there for a serious type of conversation.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.840]   So I'll really play into that, too.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.600]   So I'm going to take a little bit of a turn.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.120]   I saw on Instagram you applied to be a host on QVC,
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.680]   which is wildly different than everything else you've done.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.160]   Other than maybe sell, you know, you were selling your your card game online.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.640]   What what's the story behind that?
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:46.040]   My whole life, people have told me I should be a QVC host,
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.040]   and I know this goes against everything I just said about being shy,
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.240]   but I'm also really good when the camera turns on.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.840]   So I've done a lot of TV thanks to Bridesmaids for Hire.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.080]   And when that camera goes on, I'm a different person.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:00.080]   My mom will say to you, she doesn't recognize me because I completely light up.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.600]   I love TV. I love that spotlight. I love it.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.440]   So my whole life, people have told me that I would do really well on QVC
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.680]   because if I genuinely like something,
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.640]   I am so passionate about it and convincing.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.400]   If I genuinely liked this water that I'm drinking,
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.440]   I would bring such passion to it that you would say, you know what, Jen,
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.640]   I'm going to give it a try because you really do seem to adore it.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.000]   I've always been that way. I'm so passionate.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.200]   So my whole life, people have mentioned QVC, mentioned that I should be a host.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.080]   And I was on Instagram one day and I saw this casting director post about it.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.440]   And I was like, you know what?
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.680]   What will it take for me to try out?
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.480]   Literally five minutes, record a five minute video.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.280]   So I did my hair. I put on some makeup.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:46.160]   I recorded a five minute video on my camera, on my phone camera,
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.720]   and I sent it to them and they liked it.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.960]   I moved to the next round.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.960]   I ended up doing like a Zoom live interview with them.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.760]   And that was all it took to try out for QVC.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.640]   Now, ultimately, spoiler alert, I did not get hired,
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.600]   but it was something that I always wanted to try.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:08.040]   And it took me nothing, five minutes of my life to initially try out
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.600]   rather than sitting there and thinking about, should I, should I, should I?
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.760]   If I get it, my whole life would have to change.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.480]   I have to move to Pennsylvania. I have to do all these things.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.680]   I'm the kind of person who has always treated life, business, relationships,
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.200]   anything like this, don't overthink it, just try, just start.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.680]   And then after you start, after you have a little bit of skin in the game,
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.640]   then figure out what the heck is going on.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.840]   With Bridesmaid for Hire, I didn't have a business plan.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.000]   I didn't have anything.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   I put the ad out there. I figured it out.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.200]   And that's how I am with every single thing I do.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.560]   I do not overthink it.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.560]   I just put it out there and then I figure it out.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.280]   And what would you tell someone if you were coaching them who's like,
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   I'm not good at that, like I'm sitting here overthinking everything.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.040]   Is there is there a trick?
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.520]   I would pick one thing tomorrow.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.520]   What's one decision?
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.440]   What's one thing you have to do tomorrow and give yourself five seconds,
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.360]   seconds, give yourself five seconds to make a decision and go.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.160]   If you're somebody who is overthinking what color shirt to wear,
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.720]   count one, two, three, four, five, grab something and wear it.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.880]   And then you deal with the consequences of that for the day.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.160]   And if you start to become a person like that, you'll start to realize, OK,
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.600]   I'm not going to overthink decisions.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.400]   I'm going to make one and then deal with the consequences.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.280]   I do this with everything in life.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.080]   And let me tell you, 90% of the things are not successful.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.640]   You haven't heard about them because they haven't taken off. Right.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.920]   But there's occasional thing here and there that ends up working out for you.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.880]   And I think that's how it has to be how I met my husband.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.040]   I like sharing this story because, again, it was a weird experiment.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.680]   It wasn't something I overthought.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.520]   I was horrible at dating. I was so awkward. I'm so shy.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.800]   I said, you know what, for the whole month of February,
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.720]   you're going to go on 14 dates that month.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.280]   I would go on four dates a day.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.760]   I didn't overthink it. Anybody who asked me out, I said, sure.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.480]   Well, me, what's what's the big deal?
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.440]   I didn't overthink it.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.440]   I became so good at dating.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.920]   I met nobody I wanted to ever see again.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.960]   I go to delete the dating app and he was my final message.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.360]   He was date 15.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.320]   Now, I could have overthought that experiment or I could have just said,
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.560]   you know what, I'm going to go on these 14 dates and we'll see what happens.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.040]   So I've tried to really be this kind of person with everything in life.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.840]   And if you're not that kind of person, that's OK.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.960]   You're not going to wake up tomorrow and do something drastic,
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.400]   but try it with a tiny, tiny, tiny, small decision
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.640]   and then see how you feel after.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.760]   Before we wrap, I want to come back to the topic of weddings
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.880]   because we're on the we're almost on the other side of this pandemic, right?
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.160]   People have canceled weddings.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.040]   What advice do you have for anyone planning a wedding coming up?
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:34.800]   Or maybe better said, what do you think, having gone to so many?
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.200]   There's three things that people care about at your wedding,
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.440]   and they don't care about anything but the three things.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.400]   Number one is the music.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.880]   It doesn't matter if you have a DJ or live music,
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.560]   but you want to have music that gets people up and dancing.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.840]   You really want to make sure that the music is good
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.720]   because that makes people have a good time and they'll never, ever forget that.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:57.200]   You could always remember the weddings where you found yourself smiling
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.840]   and laughing and just having a good time.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.120]   And usually music helps make that happen.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.600]   Number two, people love food.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.720]   So good food will make your wedding phenomenal.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.640]   And here's the thing.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.640]   You don't have to go with a traditional wedding caterer.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.840]   You don't have to have steak and fish and chicken.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.680]   You can have whatever kind of foods you want, make it unique, make it about you.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:19.400]   Go to local restaurants, have food trucks, have food there
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.040]   that you genuinely would be excited to eat,
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.560]   because usually that wedding food goes in the trash.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.920]   You don't even want to eat it.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.120]   And number three is some sort of open bar or alcohol.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.960]   People love their drinks and having that just makes them happy.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.240]   I don't personally care about number three at weddings.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.400]   So I'll give you one more thing that really matters is the weather.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.680]   You know, the weather can really affect your wedding.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.400]   So if you're having some sort of outdoor experience or wedding,
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.080]   make sure you always have an indoor rain backup plan
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.600]   because your guests don't want to feel uncomfortable in any sort of way.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.160]   My number one tip for people getting married,
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.760]   and I beg you to listen to me on this, is please do not go into debt
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.800]   with your wedding.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.160]   Yes, it's a big celebration and it's super important,
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.360]   but it is never worth going into debt.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.480]   If you don't have the cash to pay for your wedding,
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.360]   try to plan a wedding where it fits the cash that you have.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:09.640]   Try not to go into credit card debt or any type of debt for your wedding.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.600]   The best way to do that is to set a budget before you start planning.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.400]   Come up with an overall number for how much you can spend.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.080]   It doesn't matter if it's 5000, 15 or 100000, pick the number first
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.080]   and then break down how much you can spend per vendor.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:27.560]   The best way to figure that out is to pick the top three things
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.760]   you care about for your wedding and then spend the most money there.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.920]   And everything else you'll find budgeted ways to pay for.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.960]   But please, your wedding is special.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.520]   It's important. It is great.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.720]   But you will never meet a couple who says, Yeah, I'm glad I went into a ton
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:44.080]   of debt and started the marriage off in debt because of the wedding.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.520]   Most people, after they get married, say it was great.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.000]   But if I could do it again, I wouldn't spend that much money.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.240]   I'm going to push back on all three music.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.920]   Do you have no, no, no, not not push back.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.680]   But sorry, let me say that again.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:02.000]   I'm going to drill down on all three and try to get more out of you.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.440]   Good music.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.840]   Do you publish your playlist like you?
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.840]   I'm sure you've had to be the one that picks the playlist.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:11.520]   Is there a Spotify playlist of what you think makes for a good dancing
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.880]   or a good vibe that you share?
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.840]   It's hard because no one ever wants to listen to my music.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:21.720]   But I would play Kesha and Chainsmokers, and I would play like these like hits
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.760]   that if you were in like a Vegas nightclub, you would play right
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.200]   because you want people to have fun and get up and dance.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:31.120]   What I think doesn't work well at weddings are the standard playlist.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.200]   Don't play Bruno Mars.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.960]   Don't play Ed Sheeran.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.880]   Don't play these songs that you hear again and again and again
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.640]   because people are so bored.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:44.320]   We just went to a wedding this weekend and the music was so slow
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.520]   that people were on the dance floor and they were like,
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.840]   wait, what do we do with our bodies to this music?
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.440]   So I know that you want to have like your favorite songs and stuff,
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.880]   but also have things that like put people in good moods.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.760]   And I can tell you all day what to play.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.400]   But of course, you know, pick songs that you also like
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.400]   and you enjoy because it is your wedding, but you want to have some good hits as well.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.680]   What about finding something that works with, you know,
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.720]   the old people in the room as well?
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.480]   I think, yeah, you want to throw in some songs that they would like.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:15.000]   But truthfully, they are the kind of people who are so happy to be at your wedding
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.160]   that they're going to dance to Kesha or the Chainsmokers,
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.480]   even if they don't know the song, they're going to have a good time.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   I think we're always like, oh, I got to play some hits that like my aunt,
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.960]   my great aunt's going to like.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.640]   But truthfully, your great aunt is going to like anything you play
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.760]   and is going to be so happy to dance.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:33.600]   We spend so much time and money accommodating everyone that's coming to our wedding.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.680]   But the truth is, we cannot make everybody happy.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.320]   So in general, try to think about how you can make everyone happy as a whole.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:44.640]   OK, on food, what are some of the most memorable food options you've had?
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.280]   I'll share mine because it was my own wedding, so that was easy.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.000]   But we decided we didn't want a seated, plated meals.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.400]   So we just picked three countries we'd been to where we love the food.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.920]   And then we just served like in paper little baskets.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:02.400]   I think one was like sliders and and sweet potato fries.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.880]   One was Thai curry.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:07.800]   And then we had like some sushi rolls or like we did chocolate chip cookies
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.920]   for dessert because we didn't really care about cake.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:13.400]   So we tried to do small plates that represent countries we'd been to.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:17.400]   But I'm curious what stood out in a memorable food way.
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.560]   And that's epic because you know what?
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.040]   People are never going to forget that.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.320]   And it meant something to you.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.120]   It was good food, obviously.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.320]   And we talked about this before.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:30.600]   I love pizza and I just went to a wedding that was all pizza.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.240]   And not only that, but at the end of the wedding,
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.760]   all of the leftover pizza that nobody ate, they had on a table with to go boxes
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.440]   that you can take home with you.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.880]   I was like, this is the best wedding ever.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.920]   But if you don't like pizza, that's OK.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.320]   But you know exactly what you did, Chris, like normal food
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.680]   that people would be excited to eat any other time.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:52.000]   I think we're also we're also forced to think
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.080]   that we need to have this traditional wedding with all this fancy food.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.880]   But the truth is, most of your guests just want the Thai food
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.880]   or the hamburger sliders or they want slices of pizza
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.720]   or they want macaroni and cheese.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:06.640]   And especially if it's because it means something to you, they'll be happy as well.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.840]   I love a wedding where the food is different, but also the food
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.720]   is something that means something to the couple.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.600]   And I especially love a wedding where they go heavy on the desserts
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.040]   because I'm a big dessert person personally.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.040]   So I love a good dessert at a wedding that's not wedding cake.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.920]   OK, and then the last this is something we struggled with.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.360]   So for drinks, do you think open bar?
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.280]   Do you think just pick two cocktails?
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.960]   What what do you think works best?
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.800]   It's funny because I'm not a drinker at all.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.440]   I am like a water, seltzer, root beer, float drinker.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:41.640]   But I know a lot of people at weddings will say this, that if possible,
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:45.120]   and if this works for your budget and your finances, a type of open bar
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.120]   is usually best.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:49.240]   And even if that means, by the way, it's open bar for an hour, that's OK.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.880]   But if that is something you can afford, that might be something to lean into
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.160]   because a lot of people do enjoy drinking.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.520]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.960]   It doesn't need to be this extravagant open bar.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:02.520]   You can do just a couple of beers or wines or you can do,
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:06.120]   you know, liquor that's not top shelf, like you can do a signature cocktail
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.680]   and then have like just beer and wine.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.040]   So you don't have to have an extensive open bar.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:15.040]   But I do think offering alcohol for your guests is something
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.120]   that they do appreciate if they have to pay for it, they will.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:21.320]   But if that's something you can budget for, I think that's a good gift
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.800]   that a lot of your guests appreciate, which is hard for me to say
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.040]   because I'm not a drinker, but I know a lot of people do care about that.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:31.800]   And from the perspective of the couple, since you have the inside
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:36.040]   ear to the bride, usually what is something that someone going to a wedding
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:41.280]   can do to, you know, be a memorable guest in a non embarrassing way?
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:46.680]   I think going along for the party and being enthusiastic
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:49.960]   during the ceremony, not having your phone out, recording everything,
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.640]   and instead just making eye contact with the couple or with the officiant.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.240]   And when they walk down the aisle, you know, smiling at them
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.600]   and just being supportive with your body language.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:01.640]   And during the wedding, you know, most couples who have a dance floor,
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.040]   they really want their guests to be on it.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.760]   So even if you're not a big dancer or you're a little bit shy,
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.680]   just crowding around the dance floor, at least having your conversations
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:10.440]   on the dance floor.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.320]   A lot of people are so stressed about is this going to be fun?
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.320]   Are people going to dance?
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.680]   So if you can sort of get near the dance floor, you make a lot of people happy.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:21.680]   Try to also if you can be like a superstar guest,
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.160]   try to be that guest that sits down at their table
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.840]   and makes genuine connections with everybody there.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.920]   Tables at weddings are really awkward.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:30.640]   You're sitting with people you don't know.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.680]   And if you could be that person that bridges that gap, that relationship,
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.960]   you make the couple happy because then they feel like everyone at their wedding
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:40.200]   had a good time, met new people, and it wasn't awkward.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.880]   Yeah, I can't remember the exact person, but I remember after our wedding,
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.160]   there was one person that all of like my aunts and uncles
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.080]   and grandparents were like, "Oh, they were such a great person."
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.400]   It was like, you know, that guest.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.800]   So maybe I'm both saying it was memorable and not because I can't remember
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.320]   who it was. Yeah.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.720]   But be that guest, be that person. Be that guest.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.240]   What about last one is I know you help people write a lot of speeches.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.920]   So obviously, if you're stuck, you have a service for it.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.960]   But what advice do you have to someone delivering a speech
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:12.360]   at a wedding to kind of nail it?
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.960]   Practice public speaking beforehand.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:18.760]   But really, what I mean by that is break down your speech in such a way
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:22.320]   where every three sentences you are forcing a two second pause.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.880]   So the three two rule, every three seconds, pause for two seconds.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.280]   That will slow you down.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.800]   That will allow your audience to hear what you're saying.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.560]   And that will let your jokes land and make them funny.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.760]   Oftentimes, when people are nervous as speakers, they go too fast
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.880]   and nobody can hear what they have to say.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:41.160]   The best length for a speech is about the three to four minute mark.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.480]   You don't need to go over that.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:46.080]   If you want to share more, write it down and hand it to the couple to read later.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.120]   But they will really respect a three to four minute speech.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.560]   And when you're writing the speech, remember, you're not writing it
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:53.320]   for the couple.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.320]   This is something that I think people don't realize.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.320]   You're actually writing the speech for the entire wedding.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.600]   So what you're really trying to do is prove the relationship
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:04.040]   you have with that person who you're good friends with
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.720]   and the person they're marrying to the entire audience.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:10.640]   So skip out on inside jokes or these long, detailed stories
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.280]   that will take an audience forever to understand and write the speech
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:17.800]   for the audience who is learning about the relationships that you have.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.320]   That's what makes for such a good speech.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.760]   Anything else I miss the advice for anyone going to or planning a wedding?
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:28.040]   If you're a bridesmaid or a groomsman in a wedding,
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.160]   the only thing I'll tell you is, please, please, please understand
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.080]   that you're allowed to say no.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.560]   We often think that if we take on that role, we have to say yes to everything.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.040]   But if there's something you can't afford, you don't want to do
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:42.120]   or you don't have time for it, make sure you say no.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.520]   How do you say no?
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.120]   You simply say, hey, thanks so much for asking me to do that.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.520]   But at this time, that's just not something that I can swing.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.240]   Happy to help in other ways.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.240]   Keep it easy. Keep it friendly.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.360]   But make sure you stand up for yourself and say no.
[00:59:54.360 --> 01:00:00.280]   Last area I'd like to ask everyone is to pick a city often where they live,
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.080]   but sometimes your favorite city to visit and tell anyone coming to that city
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.200]   where they should have a meal, grab a drink and something unusual to do.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.280]   I would love for you to come visit us in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.960]   It's a small town, a small neighborhood in Brooklyn, right outside of Manhattan.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.240]   When you get here, you're going to get off the subway on Bedford Avenue.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.520]   You're going to walk to Joe's Pizza.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.520]   It's a famous pizza place all over New York.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:28.200]   You're going to get a slice of cheese pizza and you're going to get it
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.320]   on a paper plate and you are going to walk with that pizza to the East River.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   Once you get to the park down there, you're going to be able
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.120]   to see the Manhattan skyline.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.960]   There's lots of places you can sit and drink and eat right there
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.240]   and have a really, really good time.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.640]   One of the cool parts about this neighborhood is all of the fun vintage shops,
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.560]   but you can shop all day bookstores you can go to.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.960]   And there's tons of music venues.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.960]   I think that there's lots of cities in the world with great music,
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.560]   but there is something so cool about the music in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.240]   I'm proud to live here.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.560]   Awesome. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.560]   This has been great.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.960]   Where can people find everything you're doing online?
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.840]   Because there is a lot.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.040]   You can check out my website, Jen Glantz dot com.
