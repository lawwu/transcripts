[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:09.200]   - Hey friends, I am so excited to welcome one of my dearest
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.960]   and oldest classical conversations friends
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.040]   to our conversation this afternoon.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.840]   I am blessed to have with us today,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.600]   Melissa Ellison of Virginia.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.440]   Melissa, how are you doing?
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.280]   - I'm great.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.200]   How are you, Lisa?
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.520]   - I am so excited to get to talk to you.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.480]   - Me too.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.820]   - I miss regular conversation with you
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.720]   and I feel like we could probably just talk
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.180]   and talk and talk about many things,
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.760]   personal as well as homeschooling.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.700]   So I'm gonna make myself stick to the subject at hand
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.640]   because I want my friends to get to know you
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.180]   as much as they can also.
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.760]   So let me start by asking Melissa,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.080]   how long have you and your husband Mike homeschooled?
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.820]   - We have homeschooled,
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.960]   trying to think, well, my one son started
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.880]   a piece of Darien's and foundations when he was four
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.480]   and he is now 21.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.280]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.680]   - And we graduated him.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.380]   So, and then we have one that's younger than that.
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.240]   So it's probably been, so how many years is that?
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.120]   (all laughing)
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.040]   - About 18 years, about 18 years.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.600]   - Sometimes I ask people how long they've homeschooled
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.620]   and they start counting from the birth of their children,
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.520]   which I completely--
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.720]   - Yeah, that's true too.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.640]   I mean, I got pregnant with my youngest
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.520]   when I was in my first year in foundations
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.720]   and he is going to be 18 next month, so.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.520]   - Sometimes I ask people and I understand them
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.600]   saying that they homeschooled from birth
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.840]   because the things that we pass on to our children
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.460]   and the things we teach them are not just academics.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.880]   And so a lot of times I feel like,
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.600]   yeah, I've been homeschooling their whole lives.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.040]   My child's almost 30, I've been homeschooling
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.820]   for almost 30 years and that's why I have gray hair.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.400]   But so, so I understand.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.280]   - It's probably longer, but that's with Cece
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.120]   because I homeschooled a couple of years before I found Cece.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.540]   - Yes, and so did I.
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.280]   And so I also have to clarify
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.860]   when I tell that to people too,
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.520]   'cause we started before I knew anything about Cece
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.320]   and I was just, you know, maybe we'll get to this.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.260]   I was making it up as I went along by myself.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.180]   But let me ask you,
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.360]   why did you and Mike begin this journey?
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.340]   - Well, to be honest, I was homeschooling.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.580]   I had, I guess I had two in school
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.160]   and I had one that was younger.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.100]   And so we were homeschooling and Sarah,
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.600]   our oldest was doing actually,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.920]   she was doing a traditional homeschool curriculum
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.400]   and we moved and our builder,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   his wife was starting a Cece community in our town
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.180]   and she invited me to join them.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.540]   It was the first Cece community in Virginia
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.220]   and it was incredible. - Oh my gosh!
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.420]   - And you know, Duran and the Stockton's,
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.940]   Kelly Stockton and so she invited me to join them
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.720]   and I was like, oh, I can't,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.280]   I just paid all this money for this curriculum
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.920]   and you know, I can't do that plus this.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   And so I just finished out the year with Sarah at home
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.340]   and then that summer I went to a practicum
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.840]   and Lee was there and so I heard her
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.880]   and I got to introduce to the program
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.260]   and was so excited and we joined for the following fall.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.500]   - That is so cool, that is so cool.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   I was also hooked after I went to a practicum
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.020]   and did not really know how in the world
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.340]   I would find the ability to pay for that program
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.500]   but it looked really wonderful.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.380]   So when you guys started your homeschool journey,
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.380]   even before you found Cece, did you have goals
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.460]   for your homeschool, like for education
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.460]   or did you have a family mission or anything
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.460]   when you started homeschooling?
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.780]   - I don't know that we had anything formal
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.780]   but I know that my husband and I both did not want
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.220]   to put our children in public school.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.940]   We did not want the government to have them
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.940]   that many hours a day and we wanted to be the ones
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.180]   to instill the biblical worldview, the God that I use
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.140]   and I was blessed also to be able to stay home
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.500]   with my children from birth so I wasn't ready
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   to give them up. (laughs)
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.940]   So that was really, you know, I guess the main reason
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.260]   that we started homeschooling.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.820]   - Yeah, I remember telling people I started homeschooling
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.400]   because I was too jealous to want somebody else
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.340]   to have the light bulb moments.
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.540]   - That is true, yes. (laughs)
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.880]   - It was fun to learn things or to watch them learn things
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.420]   and be excited and I kind of wanted to keep that.
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.520]   Yeah, I love what you said though
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.580]   about the biblical worldview being really important
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.860]   to your family and recognizing that probably
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.500]   a government-oriented, funded, guided school
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.660]   was not gonna pass on the values that you wanted.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.380]   Yeah, so you and I started homeschooling
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.740]   in relatively the early years.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.260]   Before there was a lot of support, frankly, out there,
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.400]   what were your early years of homeschooling like?
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.680]   Where did you find support?
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:16.000]   - Well, I would say that definitely the CC community,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.620]   you know, you found like-minded people and moms
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.420]   that you could commiserate with, right?
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.860]   And I started in CC my first year, I was a tutor
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.780]   and so I had, you know, they had their practicums
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.680]   and three-day trainings, that kind of thing.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.960]   And then really quickly, I think the following year,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.960]   I became a state manager, or I became a director,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.740]   then a state manager, so it was a really quick,
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.240]   you know, kind of going up the rungs.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.740]   'Cause like you said, we were just starting out
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.160]   and there was a lot of need for leadership.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.820]   But I would say that, you know, the support
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.140]   was within the community and the moms there.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.380]   CC offered as much support as they could.
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.780]   It's gotten a ton, I mean, there's a lot more.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.700]   And then, too, you know, our husbands, right?
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.920]   I mean, our husbands were really supportive.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.140]   They couldn't be there on a day-to-day basis to help,
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.540]   but they, you know, were supportive.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.940]   And their role as the head of the home
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.540]   and, you know, that kind of thing, so.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.380]   - Yeah.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.540]   - That's what I would say.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.140]   - Was your family, how did your family feel
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.620]   about like your mom and dad and aunts and uncles
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.480]   and extended family, how did they feel
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.300]   about homeschooling when you told them
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.660]   that's what you were gonna do?
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.780]   - Actually, my parents were very supportive.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.660]   My mom has been a teacher forever.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.120]   And she's still teaching.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.980]   And, you know, I don't even know how many years later,
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.120]   probably 50 years later.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.540]   But, and over the years, she actually,
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.000]   even she taught in a Christian school for a long time.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.900]   And then over the years, there's been times
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.520]   where she has not been working in a school setting
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.100]   and she has helped to homeschool my children
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.660]   and other children that, you know,
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.620]   were in our, you know, community kind of thing like.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.700]   And so they've been, they were very supportive.
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.580]   - That is so great.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.420]   I've heard lots, and I know that you have too,
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.140]   as you've served as a leader in Classical Conversations,
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.240]   we hear lots of stories of families who are not supportive,
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.660]   who are super suspicious, sometimes even spouses
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.500]   who are not initially excited about homeschooling.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.380]   I can remember my own mom and dad and even my sister
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.100]   thinking that we were doing this weird thing,
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.340]   this counter cultural weird thing
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.760]   to their grandchildren and nieces.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.460]   But there were great moments of repentance
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.680]   a couple of years in where they each individually came
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.980]   and said, yeah, we were so wrong.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.740]   The results that they saw helped them to go back
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.340]   and take a second look at what we were doing.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.540]   And they really became supporters
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.980]   of our homeschool endeavors as well.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.980]   So why is community so important?
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.660]   You've mentioned a couple of things,
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.660]   but I wanna just really synthesize all those answers.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.500]   As homeschoolers in the world that we live in now even,
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.020]   why is community so important?
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:39.680]   - Well, I think God calls us to live in community, right?
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.780]   And it's important because, number one,
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.820]   if you have two, if one falls down,
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.260]   the other lifts them up, and if one is cold,
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.440]   the other keeps them warm.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.420]   And so I think God really meant for us to be in community
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.480]   and that it's for encouragement
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.400]   and we can share each other's burdens
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.020]   and pray for each other.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.420]   And it's also to sharpen us, right?
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.600]   To challenge us when we need to be challenged
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.820]   and hold us accountable when we need to be held accountable.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.660]   And so I think it's a wonderful thing
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.000]   that God has made us to be in community.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.880]   - I do too.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.700]   Community is awesome.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.580]   And that's why I, that's one of the reasons
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.760]   that I absolutely fell in love with Classical Conversations,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.220]   that classical Christian community.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.360]   And it's the community that keeps us going.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.040]   I've said for years and years,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.520]   and pride comes all over the countries,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.600]   that as long as we don't all have a bad day
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.140]   on the same day, we can all keep going.
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.400]   And that's the power of community.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.820]   When you and your husband began homeschooling,
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.700]   did you know what you were doing?
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.040]   (laughing)
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:04.880]   - No.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.700]   (laughing)
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.040]   Do any of us know what we were doing?
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.880]   - No, and sometimes I think if we did know,
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.000]   we might be afraid.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.840]   - That is true.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.680]   - Very, very afraid.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.500]   - That is true.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.340]   (laughing)
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.840]   - So how did you, but you kept at this for 18 years,
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.940]   so you must have learned what to do.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.280]   How did you learn to homeschool?
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   I mean, did you read about it in books?
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.900]   Did you go to conferences?
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.200]   Did you have friends who became mentors?
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.160]   How did you learn how to homeschool?
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.880]   - Well, I would say at the beginning,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.560]   it was, I really didn't know anyone.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.400]   Or if I did, it was very few people who homeschooled.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.240]   Like there was no one in my church that was homeschooling.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.820]   We were kind of thought of as kind of a little odd,
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.660]   you know, because we were old.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.120]   We didn't have a lot of young families in our church anyway.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.280]   But yeah, so I didn't really know.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.480]   And my oldest daughter, Sarah, had been,
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.180]   our church had a Christian school.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.120]   And so she was there for kindergarten and first grade.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.620]   And they did a BECA.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.800]   And so I just got online
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.680]   and got the BECA homeschooling curriculum.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.660]   And that's what I did.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.800]   - Yeah, and just look what you found.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.880]   - So yeah, so I basically did that.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.740]   And I started, you know, I would read,
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.440]   I would, you know, research.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.620]   And I ended up at the ATAB Heave Conference
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.620]   in here in Virginia.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.740]   And, you know, went to all kinds of seminars
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.700]   and, you know, visited all the vendors
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.860]   and kind of saw what I liked.
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.060]   And I just did different things.
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.340]   And then, but as I, as you know, as you get more children,
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.640]   you can't, you know, doing a traditional curriculum,
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.940]   especially, you can't teach everything
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.180]   to all of them in one day.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.460]   It just was too much.
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.100]   And it was about that time, I guess,
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.140]   that when we had moved
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.820]   and I was introduced to classical conversations,
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.580]   I was, I had just put Sarah, my oldest,
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.740]   I had just started some like video homeschooling with her,
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.260]   with Rebecca, because I was like,
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.660]   I can't do her and my, you know, my next child,
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.580]   Jonathan and the third one.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.280]   And so I had kind of was putting her, you know,
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.540]   in front of a computer, which I didn't really like,
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.820]   but I felt like I didn't have a lot of choice.
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.780]   And then was introduced to classical conversations
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.120]   and went to a practicum and saw how I could homeschool
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.720]   all my children with the same thing at different levels
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.300]   and very appealing as well as the classical model.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.500]   And so that's when we started with classical conversations.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.740]   - Yeah, that is great.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.740]   I can imagine how frustrating it was to think,
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.540]   gosh, I'm doing this with Sarah, but now I have this one.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.620]   Now I have this one.
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.820]   And if I add any more, what in the world?
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.260]   So I think that's cool that what you found refreshing
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.260]   about CC was help to homeschool all of your kids together
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.380]   so that it really was family learning.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.740]   - It was, yeah.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.320]   And even the little ones that weren't in school
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.140]   picked up a ton.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.580]   - Oh my gosh, right?
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.080]   I can remember when my youngest, we were memorizing,
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.080]   we were gonna memorize this long passage from Philippians
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.140]   with our older daughter, who was four,
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.180]   she was four, almost five, and her little sister
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.560]   was just sitting on the couch with us at night.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.700]   I mean, she was just, she just was like the lump
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.100]   that was sitting there.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.980]   She was just along for the ride.
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.940]   We weren't trying to get her to memorize.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.700]   And one night when I said, okay, let's start,
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.740]   I thank my God.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.040]   And she started saying the verse with us
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   'cause I didn't say, you know, Stephanie, let's do this.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.580]   I just said, let's start.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.100]   And she started rattling it off.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.420]   And I thought, oh my goodness,
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.140]   there is something to this repetition thing.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:05.980]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.980]   I love it that you found a way to learn as a family,
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.300]   which becomes, the more that we understand
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:20.300]   about building a family culture and being lifelong learners,
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.700]   the more appealing learning as a family becomes.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.860]   So that resonates with me too.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.900]   Let me ask you this question, Melissa.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.500]   Are you still learning?
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.140]   Are you still learning at the homeschool?
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.540]   - Definitely.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.580]   I am not homeschooling anymore,
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.560]   but I definitely am always learning.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.540]   And that's one thing I see with my kids too.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.540]   I think I see a love of learning which I really value
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.660]   because you don't see that,
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.460]   I don't think in our culture very much.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.140]   And, you know, just to see that they love to learn
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.100]   and they're still learning, you know.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.000]   - I love that too.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.020]   And I often tell people that that is one
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:08.020]   of the happiest byproducts to me of homeschooling
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.820]   and especially homeschooling classically,
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.820]   that my girls really do, A, know how to learn, right?
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.020]   'Cause those classical tools are just awesome
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.240]   and they become just your knee-jerk response
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.680]   to whatever you need to learn in whatever area of your life,
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.100]   not just academics, but they also really love to learn.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.940]   - Yes, yes.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.740]   - And that's just beautiful to me.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.260]   - It is beautiful.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260]   - And we've talked about the fact
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.100]   that the classical education is really,
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:45.100]   'cause I suspect that if Sarah had stayed watching videos
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.420]   for her education all day,
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.140]   that she might not have loved learning so much.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.640]   - Oh, I guarantee you.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.940]   (laughing)
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.820]   - So I really think that classical education
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.460]   is onto something.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.940]   Let me ask, and I know we both have admitted
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.340]   that we didn't know a whole lot
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.260]   about classical education when we started.
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.380]   I mean, I had read "The Well-Trained Mind"
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.220]   and I kept getting--
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.060]   - That's off to you.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.640]   I'd read little pieces of it here in the yard,
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.500]   but I don't think I got through the whole thing.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.540]   (laughing)
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.240]   - Okay, I couldn't afford to buy it.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.420]   It was a really fat book.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.260]   - Yeah, it was.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.700]   - And so I would check it out from the library
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.780]   and I'd read some chapters and I would think,
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.540]   yeah, that's really good, but I just can't.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.100]   And so I would turn it back in
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.500]   and then I would be convicted
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.900]   and I would check it out again
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.200]   and I'd read some more and then I would turn it back in.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.020]   And I really, and I thought, this is it.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.140]   I mean, so I didn't know to call it classical education.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.720]   And I just, there's something about the classical model
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.620]   that resonated with my soul.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.340]   And I knew I want my children to be curious.
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.100]   I want them to be learners.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.880]   I think that memorizing,
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.460]   I knew from being a kindergarten teacher,
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.940]   memorizing is super easy for them and it's very natural.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.620]   I want us to dig deep.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.640]   I want us to do it as a family.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.260]   And so I tried doing that at my home by myself
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:10.180]   before we found CC and it goes really, really well
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.980]   for about two or three months.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.960]   And then it gets hard to keep pulling all those resources
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.220]   and to evaluate what is it that we should be learning
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.440]   and is this gonna end up being anything
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.000]   at the end of all things?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.780]   Will it tie together?
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.200]   And so I worried about that.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.400]   And that's one of the things that really drew me
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.640]   and my husband to classical conversations
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.080]   is that there was a plan.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.920]   There was a purpose.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.440]   It was going somewhere.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.120]   I wanna ask you, what did it look like
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.120]   to educate classically at your house when you started out?
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.680]   - Oh, that's many years ago, Lisa.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.800]   (laughing)
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.480]   If I can remember correctly.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.000]   (laughing)
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.040]   You know, it was just around the kitchen table
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.040]   or on the couch, reading books and wrote memory,
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:11.460]   those kinds of things.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.480]   My kids, and I'm sure yours too,
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.080]   especially when they're little, they love the songs.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:22.320]   So doing lots of singing and just hands on kind of things.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.560]   And I remember, I was kind of like you
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   before I found classical conversations,
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.960]   like I was a little bit nervous.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.320]   Like, how am I gonna make sure my kids know
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.440]   what they need to know?
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.240]   And are they gonna be not prepared?
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.600]   Like people are gonna be able to say,
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.480]   oh, they were homeschooled.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.560]   So they don't know what public school or whatever.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.720]   - Right, exactly.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.640]   - But one thing that always stuck with me
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.760]   and I still say this, my oldest daughter, Sarah
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.480]   is homeschooling her little ones,
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.020]   her kids with classical conversations.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.000]   But I remember saying this too.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.320]   I've said this to lots of people.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.560]   I remember Andrew Poodle was saying once that,
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.260]   with the memorization and the classical model
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.120]   that history and science,
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.520]   no one knows everything about history and science.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.280]   It's always evolving.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.920]   It's always, there's always new things.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   And so not to worry about learning everything,
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.600]   because you can always, you teach your child how to,
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.080]   like you said, you teach them how to learn,
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.880]   you teach them how to research
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.800]   and they can find out the answers themselves
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.640]   because we're never gonna know everything about everything.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.220]   And so teaching them how to learn
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.360]   and teaching them how to find the answers
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.360]   is just as important as not being worried
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.000]   that they don't know everything.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.240]   That was very reassuring to me too
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.440]   at certain points in my journey.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.560]   - I love that.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.360]   I think that is really true.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.580]   It is reassuring to have somebody say,
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.840]   there's no way to learn everything.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.160]   So stop making that your goal.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.320]   'Cause I remember wondering,
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.400]   how am I gonna teach the things,
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.400]   teach them to be good at the things that I wasn't good at
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.840]   or that I didn't fully understand or appreciate?
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.280]   There were things that I could do,
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.400]   but I didn't appreciate it.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.760]   And I knew if I tried to teach that,
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.680]   it would not inculcate love in them
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.360]   because the love was not in me.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.860]   And so I thought this is gonna go awry somehow.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.600]   But that classical model, I love, love what you said,
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.600]   that it's teaching them how to learn and how to find answers
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.360]   that is the best thing to be teaching them.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.280]   And so what classical education looks like at home,
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.040]   yeah, what you said is really true.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.480]   It's a lot of reading, a lot of hands-on,
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.920]   a lot of chanting and singing
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.600]   because it's a lot of memory work in those early years.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.440]   And then even in the challenge years,
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.840]   as they become ready to use all that memory work
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.120]   to compare things or to solve problems or whatever,
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.160]   it still doesn't exactly look like what we came up
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.020]   through the public school doing.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:32.360]   But it is a beautiful life of asking questions
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.320]   and running after answers.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.160]   - Oh, I like that.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.960]   Yes, running after answers, I love that.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.280]   - Yeah, I like that.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.400]   How did you grow in your understanding
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.580]   of the classical model and what helped you most?
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.200]   - I would say just immersing yourself in it
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.280]   and trusting, you know, just trusting,
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.280]   like with classical conversations,
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.200]   I just, I'm one of those people
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.680]   that I just kind of trusted what Lee said.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.140]   It made sense and I, you know,
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.680]   and then being a learner yourself
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.680]   and just walking the path and trusting the process,
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.840]   trusting the model, trusting God through it all,
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.940]   you know, just kinda, and you just grow in your knowledge
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.000]   with, you know, community, other people around you
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.700]   and asking questions yourself, you know?
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.520]   So, and seeing the fruit of it, you know,
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.240]   you see the fruit of it in your children
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.720]   as they go through the different, you know,
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.600]   the different stages of learning
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.900]   and what a beautiful thing it is to see
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.240]   when they get to that, you know, dialectic and rhetorical
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.480]   stage and you're like, wow, you know,
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.520]   this does work, you know, and so.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.440]   - Yeah, I know that I, like you said,
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.800]   grew in my knowledge of the classical model
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.960]   by reading, by going to practicums,
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   by listening and that repetition is not just good
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.600]   for our little kids, it's good for us to hear
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.460]   those same ideas about the grammar of a subject,
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.660]   the vocabulary and the rules and the dialectic
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.700]   of a subject learning to wrestle with the big ideas
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.020]   and make those comparisons and then the rhetoric of it
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.780]   using what we know to be creative or to solve a problem
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:35.280]   or to pass on our passion, all of that I learned,
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.220]   like you said, by doing and by living it
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:43.940]   and by, frankly, by becoming a learner myself.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.900]   - Yes, and just like you said,
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.400]   we all start at that grammar stage, you know,
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.660]   no matter how old we are, if we don't know something,
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.560]   you know, so you and me and, you know,
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.260]   hundreds and thousands of other, you know,
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.700]   classical conversations parents are, you know,
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.460]   that's how we learn the classical model,
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.260]   if we didn't know it, was starting at the grammar stage
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:13.260]   and, you know, walking through it ourselves, so.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.740]   - That's so true, by doing it, by doing it,
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.140]   over and over and over.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:23.940]   I can remember back when we were state managers together,
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.740]   it feels like a lifetime ago.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.460]   - It does feel like a lifetime ago.
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.300]   - When I would go and talk about, speak at a practicum
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.180]   about the classical model,
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.560]   even though I was still learning about it
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.360]   and I'm still learning about it after all these years,
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.360]   I would go and talk about it and every year,
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.080]   I could talk about it with a little more assurance
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.800]   and a deeper understanding
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.580]   because I had walked a little farther along the path
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.840]   with my children and I can remember in the early years
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.720]   telling people how amazing the challenge program was
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.460]   because I truly believed the example that was set
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.360]   and what Lee had said and what I had read,
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.100]   but I didn't have a kid in challenge yet.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.140]   But when my girls got to be challenge students,
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.340]   every year was a jaw-dropping aha moment for me
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:21.340]   because I saw a little bit more clearly how those pegs
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.340]   that we had spent all those years pounding in,
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.340]   all those little pieces of knowledge
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.180]   were really being pulled out of them
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.580]   at the opportune moment and they were wrestling
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.000]   how to put them together into some beautiful way
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.920]   of understanding the world
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.900]   and what they were being asked to do
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.160]   or even understanding themselves.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.020]   And it was just great.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.340]   So I think that you're onto something.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.980]   We grow in our knowledge of the classical model as we use it
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.500]   and as we employ it.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.420]   (gentle music)
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.480]   you
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:06.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
