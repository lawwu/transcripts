[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.320]   >> You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.360]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.200]   I'm Tim Chen and I'm joined by Kent Young. Kent, how are you doing?
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.560]   >> Hey, Tim. I'm doing great.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.520]   >> Kent, you and I were talking about the art of
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.840]   storytelling and how to capture someone's attention.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.500]   I wanted you to share with the listeners
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.040]   your example because I thought it was really fascinating.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.440]   >> The example about my history, learning how to be a minister?
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.400]   >> Yeah, that and you went into the whole like
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.500]   the preacher analogy and how
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.000]   they capture attentions and that just really fascinated me.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.560]   >> Well, I think with any style of communication,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.040]   you have to make some connection with your audience.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.960]   I think the best way that that's done,
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.640]   and we see it all the time like comedians,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.060]   what do comedians do?
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.640]   They basically through a process
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.240]   of telling their own personal story
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.640]   because people really want to hear about someone else.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.400]   Then they immediately pull themselves into that experience
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.480]   and through that filter begin to feel how that might feel for them.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.880]   That's how we create empathy as human beings.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.480]   It's funny. Yes, I did study
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.600]   four or five years to be a religious science minister.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.440]   Now, religious science in and of itself is a little bit different,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.400]   little new thought, but the reality was learning all the concepts was great.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.880]   But then at the end,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.000]   they go, "Okay, now you get to stand up and talk about it."
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.680]   >> You can actually talk about what you learned and why somebody else should care.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.440]   I think that's the point.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.800]   The point is that in storytelling specifically,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.960]   what we start out with is,
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.680]   we start out with ourselves and we talk about,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.800]   we'll present the concept,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.840]   but then we'll backtrack and we'll say,
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.240]   "Hey, this means a lot to me because,"
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.480]   and we begin to explain how in our own personal lives,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.560]   how that topic, that concept,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.120]   that view of the world applies to me personally.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.720]   The goal is that if we are paying attention to our audience,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.240]   we explain that in a way that the majority of people will get it.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.960]   We'll appreciate that and they get pulled into it.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.600]   Then at that point, you can pretty much start dropping
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.520]   other topics in that they then begin to be even more engaged about.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.040]   >> Yeah. I totally agree.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.640]   I think, yeah, you're right.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.440]   There's some formulas out there that allow you to do a better presentation,
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.680]   and they usually say,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.280]   start with a personal anecdote or a grip or a hook that's interesting,
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.920]   and then you lead into what you want to talk about,
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.760]   and you come full circle back to the hook.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.080]   >> It reminds me of this one preacher I had once.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.320]   Yeah, this is when we started off this conversation while preaching.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.880]   He started off with this hilarious anecdote or story.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.040]   The story goes, there's a man in a boat in the middle of the ocean,
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.080]   and the boat springs a leak.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.000]   The water is going up,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and so this preacher, he says,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.280]   he prays to God, say, "God, help me."
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.840]   For a while, nothing happens.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.120]   An individual on a canoe rose by,
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.320]   and the guy's like, "Hey, you need some help over there?"
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.600]   He's like, "No, no, don't worry. I got this.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.880]   God's going to help me." He's like, "All right, cool, cool, cool."
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.720]   Then now the water's up to his waist,
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.640]   and now the boat's about to capsize.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.240]   He's like, "God, where are you? Come help me."
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.720]   A guy comes by in the motorboat and comes by and say, "Hey, man,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.120]   it looks like you're taking on some water there, buddy. You okay?"
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.400]   He's like, "No, no. I'm good, man.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.880]   God's going to take care of me."
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.440]   Now the water's totally capsizing the boat.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.560]   The boat's no longer visible.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.520]   He's just treading water.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.400]   He's like, "God, where are you? Help me."
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.040]   Then this carnival ship, a cruise ship comes by.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.320]   He's like, "Yo, you okay out there? Do you need a life vest?"
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.880]   He's like, "No, man, I'm okay.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.520]   God's going to help me," and he goes away.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.640]   Then he drowns.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.920]   He goes to heaven. He's like, "God, where were you?
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.560]   Why didn't you help me?" God's like, "I tried.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.680]   I sent you a canoe, a boat, and a cruise."
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.040]   That led into his whole point around like,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.080]   "Hey, are you listening?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.880]   Are you paying attention? Are you being aware?"
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.280]   But that intro totally took me by surprise
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.080]   because normally I'm sitting there in a pew
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.440]   kind of falling asleep or daydreaming,
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.480]   and that totally pulled me in.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.840]   I utilize a very similar skill set at work, too,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.480]   where you mentioned earlier about captivating your audience
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.320]   and knowing your audience,
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.920]   and it differs by seniority level.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.920]   And with senior leadership, I do the very same thing.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.720]   Give a little anecdote,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.640]   something that's top of mind for them,
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.800]   and I'll bring an illustration
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.280]   of something I'm trying to solve, for example,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.080]   to kind of illustrate what I'm trying to do,
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.640]   and I'll lead very quickly into it.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.840]   So like, given that, here's what we're trying to do today.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.000]   We're going to do these three things as an outcome,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.480]   and we'll lead right into it.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.240]   But again, it's grabbing their attention,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.360]   and you know it's working
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.320]   because they'll close their laptops
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.400]   or they'll stop scribbling on their notebooks.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.040]   So the body language is also a tell.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.560]   - Totally, and it's interesting, too,
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   because if it's something that you've done in the past
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.960]   and it's something you haven't tried at this new company,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.400]   one of the things that I'll do is I'll say,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.360]   you know, in my last engagement with this sort of setup,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.280]   I did these three specific things
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.760]   and saw a net increase of X, right?
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.760]   I find that, especially with senior leadership
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.280]   and to a certain degree, people that are peers,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.880]   if you show up with not just an example,
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   but you show metrics where you've hit the ball
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.840]   out of the park or at least, you know, got a base hit,
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.680]   people listen to that
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.320]   because we tend to be very metrics-driven, right?
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.160]   - Yes.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.500]   - Sometimes that's good, sometimes that's bad,
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.880]   but if you're metrics-driven and you give that anecdote
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.280]   and you say, I did this with this result,
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.120]   wow, it's an amazing level of engagement you get.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.160]   - Yeah, you know, I'll give you an example
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.960]   of where it fails, you know,
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.400]   and it just happened in the last 30 minutes at work
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.760]   and I'm just trying to figure my way through it.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.000]   So one of the senior leaders in the company,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.800]   they're in the break room, I was in there as well,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.880]   I don't have any opportunity to speak to this individual,
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.640]   so part of it is like, hey, I want to put my name out there
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.640]   and whatnot, didn't come to it totally prepared though,
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.340]   probably should have thought this through a little bit.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.720]   So I went in there and just say, hey, you know,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.240]   like, how are you doing?
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.160]   It's a Friday, right?
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.080]   And then they responded, they're really kind
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.440]   and they threw out a question at me, it's like,
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.840]   hey, how is this aspect of your business doing,
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.440]   like web traffic or whatnot?
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.880]   And I panicked and didn't have anything.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.160]   And I threw out a number, which absolutely made no sense.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.840]   As a matter of fact, I think the number I recalled
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.000]   was based on my last job, which is peanuts compared
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.720]   to the metric that I was supposed to give him.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.520]   And then like, and I kind of stumbled my way through that.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.200]   And then like, but then I said, hey, look,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.480]   I do have data I do want to share with you.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.960]   Like, if you want to have time, let's talk through it.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.200]   He's like, cool, let's do that.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.080]   Then I was thinking to myself, like, oh man,
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.360]   I did a really bad job of engaging my audience there.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.240]   That was like a total fail.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.480]   What I hoped would redeem myself and we'll follow,
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.240]   we'll figure out if this happened or not.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.680]   I can talk offline, is I sent them a message afterwards.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.080]   I was like, hey, you know, like, here's the answer.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.760]   Here's the actual day that you're looking for.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.080]   And here's how it performs against the quarterly,
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.120]   monthly average this year.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.560]   So kind of immediately paint a good story.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.000]   Like, here's how we're doing.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.800]   Embrace my vulnerability a little bit.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   I was like, hey, look, by the way, like, you know, honestly,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.720]   like in that moment, I don't get,
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.280]   I don't get many opportunities to talk to you.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.120]   So you know what?
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.960]   I kind of panicked and my mind blanked, but you know what?
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.680]   I do have a lot of good data to share with you
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.760]   that I prepared for you.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.560]   So looking forward to going through with you.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.840]   Even that is my version of an anecdote where you,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.680]   you take something,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.360]   an element of your personal experience you're going through,
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.200]   kind of open that up a little bit to your audience
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.760]   and then have a different connection
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.120]   beyond just the data, right?
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.760]   So now like he knows, okay, Tim's human.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.880]   That wasn't the best first impression probably,
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.680]   but hey, there's, he set some context.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.280]   It's kind of funny, self-deprecating humor,
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.000]   but like we're still gonna get what's important.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.640]   And so again, just even that example
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.240]   is like trying to use personal story to tell,
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.240]   maybe influence a conversation
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.120]   or a direction that you want to go
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.360]   is really, really important.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.600]   - Well, and, but we're all fallible.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.000]   And some executives, I'll be honest,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   some executives don't place a high value
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.120]   in someone's willingness to fail and admit to it.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.360]   Yet others are like, oh, he totally saw his mistake
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.240]   and he corrected for it.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.680]   And that's all they really care about.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.600]   I mean, you're not always gonna have the answer
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.920]   in that moment, right?
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.800]   But more importantly, like, did you wait two weeks
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.640]   to get back to him?
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.480]   No, you did it within minutes.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.680]   - Yeah, well, let's hope he sees it that way.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.720]   I'll let you know how it goes.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.240]   - Right, right, right.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.480]   It's all about how we deliver on stuff.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.040]   - So shifting gears a little bit,
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.720]   you and I were talking about the importance
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.280]   of project management.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.280]   And that topic is really near and dear to my heart
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.600]   'cause that's how my career started.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.000]   Now, I don't know if I told you like,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.280]   like I graduated during the dot-com bubble burst,
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.440]   like nobody was hiring.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.200]   And what I, and then with a marketing degree,
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.800]   like first position game, like go during that time,
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.360]   that and effective sales.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   And so I took on all these random oddball jobs.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.160]   One of them was at a startup
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.960]   and essentially it was project management.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.840]   And I think the, I didn't have any hard skills to my name.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.760]   Like I wasn't a developer, I wasn't whatever.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.000]   As a matter of fact, when I graduated from college
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.240]   and it was like a business, you know, business major,
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.240]   the only skillset I had was like communication skills.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   And that doesn't read well on resumes at all.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.960]   And so what it looked like to me was like taking,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.360]   being able to communicate,
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.080]   knowing how to hold people accountable,
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.000]   and then just be organized.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   I kind of stumbled my way into project management.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.640]   And so I kind of want to hear from you, you know,
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.280]   like obviously you have a really strong point of view
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.240]   on the value of the skills of project management.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.160]   Can you just tell me a little bit,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.480]   like what it means to you?
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.200]   - Oh, I can, I could spend a lot of time on that.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.040]   (laughing)
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.400]   Oh, so we're clear.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.480]   Well, so let's think about this for a second, right?
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.120]   The context in which we were originally talking about this
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.400]   was when I talk to people that are getting
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.880]   out of high school, new college grads,
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.320]   people that are looking for summer jobs,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.080]   young people for the most part.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.560]   And one of the things that I'll tell them,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.440]   especially in the workplace,
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.840]   one of the first things I'll say is,
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.920]   hey, if you're going to do any continuing education,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.480]   I would recommend that you take a project management course.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.040]   And they look at me and I go,
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.560]   so let me tell you why that's important to me.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.560]   And I tell them, hey, when I was new to my,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.840]   when I first moved to Northern California,
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.680]   I had a little bit of experience doing marketing.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.680]   I was a graphic designer slash with a college degree.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.440]   So what I learned pretty early
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.680]   with that project management class was,
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.520]   oh crap, everything I do, right?
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.520]   Everything I do has an impact if I'm organized, right?
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.120]   If I'm not organized, it always looks like a yard sale.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.960]   Right? - Yeah.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.080]   - And the example is that,
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.040]   even when I was as a graphic designer, right?
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.160]   The old style of graphic designer,
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.560]   basically you had to take line art,
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.680]   go into a camera room, take a picture of it,
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.040]   create a negative.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.960]   Then you took that negative, you manipulated it.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.760]   You did, if there were photographs,
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.640]   you had to shoot what we called half tones,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.240]   basically breaking it up into a bunch of dots.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.080]   And then you would strip all that stuff together
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:56.080]   and make basically a platform
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.600]   that you would use to burn a printing plate.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.520]   And then somebody could go
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.800]   and print that piece of artwork.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.960]   Well, you have to understand
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.280]   every single piece of that process
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.880]   and do it in a certain process
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.960]   'cause you don't end up with a finished product otherwise.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.880]   Right? - Mm-hmm.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.680]   - So one of the things that made me,
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.480]   I went from just being a graphic designer
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   to actually being a salesman in the printing industry.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.880]   And what made me a great salesperson
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.880]   was I understood what my audience, my prospect,
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.200]   I really understood well what they wanted to accomplish.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.560]   'Cause I understood all of the pieces of the puzzle
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.880]   and what they were actually trying to finish with
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.920]   and actually give to their audience.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.280]   And often I would sit there and I would negotiate with them,
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.880]   hey, I can do this,
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.600]   but I can do it more efficiently and cheaper
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.160]   if we do it like this.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.960]   And they'd look at me and they'd go, really?
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.680]   And of course, it made me a really great salesperson.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.640]   So even in sales, having that background
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.360]   and understanding what the process was
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.000]   that was gonna be employed
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.800]   in order to get them a finished product
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.760]   made me an even better salesperson.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.600]   - Yeah, I thought you were gonna go
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   a different direction with this,
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.920]   but that makes a lot of sense.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.920]   When I think of project management,
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.240]   especially in today's day and age,
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.080]   there's a few things.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.840]   Like the skills you gain
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.240]   from knowing how to hold people accountable
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.920]   and driving a schedule forward.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.400]   Rightfully, that skillset applies to many a job discipline
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.840]   as you're describing, right?
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.800]   Project management specifically is fascinating
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.960]   because you can actually shift across industries.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.200]   You can go from consumer to enterprise
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.360]   to you can go from marketing to product management.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.360]   Like it's truly the one transferable skill
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.760]   that can be like a leap off point to so many things.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.240]   I think that's what's so important today,
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.880]   especially with the way the job market is right now.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.560]   We're trying to figure out like how do I market myself
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.160]   and how do I maybe reinvent myself or whatnot,
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.840]   or you're maybe looking for a new starting point.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   There are a lot of developers I know
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.120]   who went from development to technical project management
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.720]   and from technical project management
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.000]   into product management, right?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.720]   And then part of that is like they couldn't make
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.960]   or they weren't comfortable making the leap
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.800]   from development to product management
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.480]   'cause they lacked at that point
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.240]   some of the soft skills needed to do that
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.160]   as well as like how to present.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.200]   And so that was a good path for them.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.760]   It's also a good entry point
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.720]   into things like program management as well.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.520]   And program management is actually a whole,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.440]   it's very distinctively different than project management,
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.520]   but lean on a similar skillsets.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.400]   So I always tell people,
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.360]   it's like, hey, if you're very early career,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.560]   like we started this conversation around like college grads
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.080]   and you're looking for that first entry point,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.760]   like project management, I think is the way to go.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.600]   And you also interact with so many disciplines
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.240]   that you can figure out like
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.200]   if there's something else you want to jump into
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.120]   or you start passively getting all the knowledge.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.360]   So you kind of understand how the departments work.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.320]   I think it's just, I think it's the most powerful,
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.080]   most overlooked role in any organization.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.560]   - Oh, and I will tell you this,
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.000]   that in the companies where they had
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.360]   departments of project management,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.280]   that stuff went so much better
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.560]   than the majority of other companies that I was at
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.400]   where we didn't have a dedicated project manager,
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.120]   because frankly, they'd assign you somebody
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.720]   and they would sit down
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.360]   and they would dig into all the dependencies.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.480]   And a lot of people don't understand
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.200]   what a dependency is, right?
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.040]   - Yeah.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.000]   - And that means that if that thing doesn't get done,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.600]   that stuff that falls further downstream doesn't, right?
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.080]   So yes, it was critical to have that.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.240]   And that stuff will often get missed
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.600]   for a couple of reasons.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.240]   But most of the time, those dependencies get missed
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.200]   because people don't understand
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.320]   the roles and responsibilities
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.640]   and the work stream that actually has to happen
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.040]   in order to produce product.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.360]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.280]   You know, I think we think about the topic
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.560]   of all these skills being additive,
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.680]   you know, like life or work experience is experience.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.040]   You know, and when I talk to people who are younger,
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.960]   they're like, "Oh, maybe they lacked experience
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.480]   "to bring into a job interview," for example.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.680]   It's like, no, like you could be a star runner
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.240]   on a track team that has nothing to do with work,
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.120]   but telling a story, back to storytelling,
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.800]   around how your dedication to your craft
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.200]   and being a team player or excelling
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.240]   or going through the struggles and hardships
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.240]   to be the best runner you can be,
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.800]   like those skillsets are another way
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   of helping people understand
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.960]   what you might bring to a work situation, right?
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.760]   So I think knowing, again, like knowing
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.960]   how to tell a story about who you are,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.160]   wrapping your experiences is huge.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.200]   I'm kind of curious, Kent, do you,
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.040]   like you and I are like, we're old hats,
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.000]   you know, we're not necessarily just hats,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.400]   but like we got plenty of white hairs
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.760]   under these caps, and we've had cumulatively
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.400]   many tens of, 20s of years in the industry.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.320]   Do you have any personal stories,
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.680]   whether it's work-related or could be a personal story
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.960]   of something that was really influential
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.400]   on how you handled yourself in the workplace
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.320]   or in your career?
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.600]   - As it relates to storytelling or--
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.400]   - Or just your life, just life experience.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   Maybe I'll lead you off with an example.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.640]   I once, during a period of unemployment,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.080]   this is during the time that .com bubble burst.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.360]   And so one of my temp jobs was,
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   I was a outbound sales at a call center for Wells Fargo.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.440]   And it was every Saturday morning,
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.200]   you're on an automated dialer,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.880]   meaning like a machine is calling someone for you,
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.080]   and you're measured by how long the conversation is.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.200]   And so you're literally auto-dialing,
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.120]   calling people at like eight in the morning,
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.520]   telling them that they've overdrafted
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.320]   their checking account by $5, now they're able to make 20.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.360]   Like no one likes that conversation.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.600]   And the thing that really sucked was,
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.680]   sometimes you're still in the middle of a call
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.120]   and the dialer already initiates the next one.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.600]   And so by the time you cut over,
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.120]   the person's already been there for like 20 seconds,
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.160]   like, "Hello, hello, who's there?"
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.920]   And in fact, when you pick up like,
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.560]   "Hi, this is Tim from Wells Fargo."
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.440]   Like they're pissed off immediately.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   And like that season was really, really tough.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.960]   And I remember I learned how to deal with rejection.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.160]   And I had a lot of crazy stories around people next to me,
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.680]   just like flaming out after a week or two weeks,
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.120]   'cause it's a grueling job and it was just terrible.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.760]   And I had my terrible weeks as well,
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.480]   but it was really formulative
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.320]   in terms of how I process information,
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.360]   how do I figure out how to take someone
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.880]   from like one end of the spectrum to like totally angry
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.080]   and somehow bringing them around to a happy place
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.280]   where they're willing to pay the big money
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.040]   in like three minutes flat?
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.640]   And how do you do that, right?
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.520]   So that was like a crazy experience that really shaped me.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.320]   Like, is there anything that you've done
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.760]   that's kind of similar where it's like,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.600]   you know what, this thing that happened to me,
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.440]   I just can't shake it.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.240]   It just, for better or for worse,
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.240]   changed how I did anything at work?
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.560]   - Well, I'll use a real life experience
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.880]   where I talked about being a graphic designer
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.800]   and moving into sales for a printing company.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.960]   So I was in Phoenix and I'm like,
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.840]   these guys are like, "Hey, do you know your stuff?
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.800]   You're really good with people.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.320]   Do you want to hire you to be a salesperson?"
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.840]   I'm like, "Okay, great."
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.960]   And so what they did was the head sales guy,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.640]   he was the older son of the two sons of the owner
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.080]   that owned this business.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:11.720]   He would take me out for one day each week
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.480]   and we would cold call businesses
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.600]   in these, basically these industrial parks.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.640]   And we'd go from door to door to door
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.160]   to find out A, what kind of business they were in,
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.960]   B, is printing something they actually do or use?
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.880]   And then if those two things are checked,
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.560]   then do they have somebody that they already use?
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:38.200]   Are they open to getting a quote for a project?
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.480]   So interesting where he would go in
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.560]   and he'd do the pitch and I'd just listen
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.120]   and we'd leave and I'd ask him questions about that.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.800]   Then I would go in and I would do a pitch
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.320]   and he would critique my pitch
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.800]   because we didn't go into every business.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.920]   I mean, some businesses don't need that, but very specific.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.640]   And one of the things that I learned from that
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.640]   was it isn't the person who's the best at it, right?
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.440]   I got very good at it,
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.160]   but it isn't necessarily the person who's the best at it.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.840]   It's the person who turns over the most rocks, right?
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.600]   So I, trust me, I got a lot of rejection.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.960]   I would go in, if I didn't actually see the person who buys,
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.920]   I'd get their business card and I'd call them
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.240]   and I'd call them and I'd call them and I'd call them.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.560]   Sometimes they would actually answer my phone call
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.120]   and give me an opportunity to bid on something.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.640]   But probably 90% of the time it was either crickets
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.120]   or don't ever call me again, right?
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.480]   So it was a lot of rejection.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.640]   But what I learned was, I'm in Phoenix, it's a big city.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.280]   I figured when I was going out to deliver a print job
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.000]   or pick up a proof or whatever,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.920]   along the way I would stop
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.720]   and I would just hit a bunch of businesses
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.600]   in these office parks.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.800]   And it's not, like I said,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.120]   it wasn't that I was any great salesperson.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.800]   I was just diligent and I focused
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   and I took every opportunity to make some cold calls
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.600]   and to drop off a business card.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.720]   And let me tell you what the result was.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   The result was, after about a year of that,
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.360]   a little less than a year,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.440]   but after about a year of that,
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.440]   they pulled me aside and said,
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.280]   we need you to dial back the selling.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.720]   'Cause we can't handle,
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.760]   I mean, you're finding the right businesses,
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.760]   you're finding the right projects,
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.440]   but we don't have enough people to support the production.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.800]   So we have to hire more people,
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.320]   put on more shifts or get more equipment.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.960]   And we don't wanna do that.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.360]   So we dialed.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.680]   And now the problem is that they tell you
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.200]   that you've gotta have the killer instinct
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.720]   to go out and find business, right?
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.640]   To be a salesman and do that cold calling.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.120]   And I looked at him and I was like,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.600]   that is not the right answer.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.160]   Right answer is,
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.560]   we're gonna give you some house accounts to manage
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.280]   so that you can spend time doing that
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.360]   instead of cold calling
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.240]   because you're beating us up with too much work.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.920]   That's one of those things where I learned,
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.480]   I listened and I executed.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.040]   And I executed so well that they finally said,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.120]   dude, dial it back.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.960]   - Yeah.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:39.040]   Do you have any examples of like advice you receive
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.640]   on the job that was really, really helpful?
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.520]   'Cause your anecdote there reminded me
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.200]   of a situation I had where it was that previous company
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.760]   and I was a senior manager at the time.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.440]   And I had just earlier in that,
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.600]   maybe like a year before that,
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.560]   I was like a project manager.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.600]   So I was still trying to learn
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.800]   what the difference is between these roles.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.280]   And I wasn't confident in how I presented myself
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.360]   or I didn't have confidence in my own ideas.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.720]   Like I knew they were solid,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.960]   but for some reason when I talked to people,
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.480]   it came out a lot less confident.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.560]   I remember there was one individual I worked with
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.560]   and he was really intimidating to me.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.720]   Like he was like physically intimidating
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.040]   and he had like, his demeanor was intimidating,
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:28.880]   but we get to know him.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.960]   He was actually a real softy,
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.280]   but most people don't see that side,
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.520]   at least not immediately.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.640]   And so I remember I had one conversation with him
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.960]   and he stopped me in mid speech.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:43.560]   He was like, Tim, stop apologizing for stuff.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.440]   Like, you know your shit.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.880]   Like, don't apologize, speak confidently.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.920]   'Cause I was always doing these things like,
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.320]   hey, you know, I don't know what's cute with you,
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.520]   but answer blank.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.440]   Or it's like, hi, I noticed this thing in the data.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.480]   I'm not sure if it was relevant to you,
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.320]   but here's what I saw.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.560]   Like all of that kind of apologetic framing of my thoughts
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.040]   was really prevalent in everything I said.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.880]   And from that moment on,
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.400]   and I still continue to try to improve upon this,
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.320]   like exert myself with more confidence,
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.240]   and know it's coming from a place of experience.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.440]   Do you have anything like that
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.800]   where like someone gave you on the job advice
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.360]   and it kind of just changed your mindset
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.760]   about how you carry yourself or how you do work?
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.480]   - Well, we all have, I think we all have examples of that.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.040]   I will say this, that as I've gotten older
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.600]   and more comfortable with my skillset,
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.840]   my confidence, I mean, you know this, right?
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.640]   I don't mince words about what I do, right?
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.280]   Like, you know, if you're gonna play in my sandbox,
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.520]   dude, I'm gonna tell you exactly what I think
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.320]   and why I think that.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.280]   That wasn't always the case.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.880]   (both laughing)
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.960]   So I can appreciate, you know, I'm the go-along guy.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.400]   So, you know, I would be like,
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.360]   hey, sorry to bother you, don't wanna interrupt, you know?
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.120]   But, so I played a lot of that soft peddling.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.120]   I think one of the things
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:13.120]   that there's a big problem of in some marketplaces,
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.120]   and certainly with people that are getting newer roles
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.120]   is this concept of imposter syndrome, right?
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.820]   - Yeah.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.580]   - 'Cause I think when I was at,
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:32.640]   I wasn't there very long, but I was a VP at GoDaddy.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:38.040]   And it was very, very, very tumultuous time for them
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.260]   'cause they'd just been acquired by a, you know,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.860]   big private equity firm,
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.240]   I think two private equity firms for a lot of money.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.800]   Anyway, so, but what was really interesting was
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.080]   that was one of those situations
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.480]   where I really did not know the landscape.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   And I got, I learned really fast that people who,
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.920]   people who you think you can trust,
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.560]   they may not have your best interest at heart, right?
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.560]   'Cause everybody's looking out for themselves.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.880]   So I think that was a challenging role for me,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.920]   not because I didn't know what to do.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.040]   I was very clear about what the role should do
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.000]   and what the work stream looked like.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.240]   The problem was more how I saw myself in that role
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.880]   and how I interacted with folks was basically,
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   I wasn't comfortable yet in that role and in that position.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.080]   And so it affected how I came across.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.320]   So I totally agree with you from that perspective.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.640]   Absolutely.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.680]   But I think one other concept, I think, you know,
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.080]   this whole concept of imposter syndrome,
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.320]   I think is really prevalent with people who get,
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.280]   who seek advancement, get it.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.480]   And then when they're in it, they can't feel comfortable
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.400]   because they feel like somehow they didn't earn it.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.560]   They didn't do enough to earn it.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.240]   Even though all of the people around them
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.680]   have already given them credit for being capable
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.640]   and see them growing into the role and all of that,
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.600]   but yet they have a hard time, right?
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.440]   - Yeah.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.320]   - In that role.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.800]   And probably the best example of that,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.840]   you're gonna love this
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.520]   'cause it has nothing to do with work.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.040]   Best example of that is people who win the lottery, right?
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.960]   85% of people who win the lottery within five years
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.000]   are more broke than they were before they won.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.280]   Did you know that?
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.800]   - No, that's a fascinating stat.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   - And it's because they can't see in their mind, right?
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.880]   They can't see in their mind them being rich.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.280]   And so what they do is they end up spending all that money
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.400]   and end up spending too much of it
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.320]   and end up worse off than when they'd gotten it.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   And so there's a whole industry of lawyers and counselors
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.760]   and financial analysts and stuff
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.580]   that just deal with sudden wealth syndrome, right?
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.880]   People that are suddenly wealthy
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.680]   and they can't figure out how the hell to be in that,
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.920]   have it be a comfortable place for them.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.720]   And so it's a really interesting situation
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.360]   where people don't get it and because they don't get it
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.280]   and they don't get the help they need
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.800]   to really understand what that means.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.640]   - Yeah.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.360]   - They end up squandering all of it.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.920]   - Yeah, it's funny.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   I've had a few conversations with folks
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.560]   in some of these videos as well
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.360]   and imposter syndrome comes up in almost all of them, right?
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.320]   And especially folks who are living in the Bay Area
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.080]   where I had a conversation with someone yesterday.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.080]   They're like, "Hey Tim, in a world where cost of living
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.920]   "keeps going up higher and higher and higher
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.100]   "and you got kids and you gotta deal with all these things,
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.120]   "but then at the same time, you accumulate wealth
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.880]   "and then you're looking around to other people
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.960]   "and you're seeing what things that they're doing
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.760]   "and kind of fighting the keeping of the Joneses.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.000]   "How do you do that?"
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.680]   And I told him, I was like,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.560]   "Quite frankly, it's a persistent thing."
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.960]   Part of it is being able to shut it off.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.760]   Some of it's kind of coming to grips
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.280]   with which aspects of it are true, right?
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.280]   And then the true areas of weakness.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.120]   And then some of it is just turning off the noise
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.520]   'cause an example that's not work-related is,
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.160]   I look down a street in my neighborhood,
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.240]   I've got like a 60-year-old house now, right?
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.560]   Which by California standards, like that's new.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.000]   You're not gonna rebuild, that's new.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.160]   But everyone on my street, well, not everyone,
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.240]   but quite a significant number of people
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.320]   are rebuilding and remodeling, right?
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.920]   And it's like, you know the cost of materials is going up
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.940]   and I'm looking at these people, I'm like,
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.040]   "You know what, how are you affording this?"
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.500]   I know the tear down of one property, for example,
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.240]   in itself and rebuild that in itself
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.640]   was like a 1.2, $1.3 million venture,
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.600]   but they had to buy the property first, right?
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.120]   And so it's like, how does that math work?
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.080]   You know, and then there's other ones
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.400]   with like their single income earners
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.240]   and they're doing remodel.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.840]   I'm like, "How are you doing that?"
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:27.840]   'Cause I'm comparing their output with my output,
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.920]   which is like zero, it's not connected in dots.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.320]   And what I had to remind myself is like,
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.420]   A, I don't know the context
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.100]   of where their wealth is coming from, right?
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.300]   Zoom just put that thumbs up on the screen.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.480]   I don't have any context.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.540]   I don't know, like they could have been a lottery winner.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.700]   They could have been a really good job investing.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.740]   Maybe they had parents and they all pulled in.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.920]   Like you just don't know, all you see is the output
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.820]   and to measure yourself against that
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.380]   is just unrealistic, right?
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.300]   And the same thing goes into work.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.100]   Like you don't know what took someone to get there
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.860]   and like, there might be a reason
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.900]   why they're just being really awesome
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:08.940]   and making you feel inadequate.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.820]   'Cause maybe they just busted their butt and they got there.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.960]   But some of it could just be like,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.280]   you're only seeing like the veneer of it.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.940]   But underneath the water, like ducks,
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.740]   their feet are doing like, right?
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.220]   'Cause they're struggling just like you are.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.780]   And like, maybe that hard work
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.400]   is because they're also insecure as well.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.540]   And so I think you're totally right.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.380]   It's such a prevalent thing.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.780]   I deal with it all the time to various degrees.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.620]   And by the thing, as we get older, like you mentioned,
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.300]   like I think we start separating like what's fact
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.780]   from fiction, what's truly important versus not.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.300]   And I think over time you develop a sense of your worth.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.500]   And so I think you're right.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.160]   As you get older, you have less appetite for the fluff.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.400]   Just shoot from the hip.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.240]   Here's what it is.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.300]   You know what you put to the table
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.740]   and let's just get right down to it.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.660]   Let's forget about the packaging.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.360]   Let's just get right to business.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.800]   - Well, and I think with young people,
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.260]   you find that, well, some people middle-aged,
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.700]   but sometimes you see it with young people
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.980]   where they will hop from job to job.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.100]   - Yeah.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.180]   - The money isn't right, or this isn't right,
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.660]   or the management isn't right,
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:14.940]   or they'll have an excuse.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:15.820]   - Yeah.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.180]   - 'Cause they're looking for the perfect scenario.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:22.620]   Well, dude, sometimes you have to make the perfect scenario
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.240]   in the place that you're at, right?
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.820]   And so that lack of patience,
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:32.820]   that lack of willing to pay your dues is concerning.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.220]   - Yeah.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.900]   - And you see that happen where,
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.260]   like, dude, you're not gonna learn the hard lessons
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.300]   if you keep jumping from job to job.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.500]   You're gonna learn hard lessons
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.400]   about people not wanting to hire you
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.300]   because you jump jobs, right?
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.160]   That's a pain by itself.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:52.160]   But just the fact that sometimes toughing it out, right?
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.120]   Just being in the role long enough
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.500]   to learn the lay of the land,
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.740]   to learn how to manage people's expectations
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.340]   and how to work with everybody at every level.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.420]   So whether it's executives, peers, or subordinates,
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.540]   or people that are somehow,
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.260]   just how you treat the receptionist.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.860]   I mean, just sometimes those soft skills,
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.740]   they don't show up.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.500]   You actually have to practice them to be good at them.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.240]   - Yeah, I love that.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.520]   I like making your own environment.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.160]   I'm gonna make that a t-shirt.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.140]   Well, hey, Kent, I just wanna thank you for your time.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:34.980]   This is really fun.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.880]   You've just gotta come back and we gotta do this again.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   There's so many things that I wanna talk to you about
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.900]   and pick your brain about.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.760]   Some of it serious, some of it not.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.940]   But yes, thank you for spending your time with me here.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:46.780]   - Oh, my pleasure.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.080]   Thank you for inviting me.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.320]   - All right, thanks, Kent.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.160]   - Yeah, bye.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.740]   (gentle music)
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.800]   you
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
