[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Alright, so I promised it is to have it tune up for a new piece of advice.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.440]   That if you work in an organization with other people, I said would be one of the
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.240]   single most effective things you could do to reduce emails in your inbox. So here it is, I call it
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:25.600]   docket clearing meetings. This is a phrase I'm stealing shamelessly from the judge John
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.400]   Hodgman podcast. They have the docket clearing episodes where they go through a bunch of cases.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.080]   It's a judicial term where a judge has a bunch of cases on their docket that they want to get
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.400]   through real quick. Your team, whatever team you work with in your knowledge work office organization,
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.560]   consider once or twice a week having a regularly scheduled docket clearing meeting. Here is how
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.200]   this meeting works. At all times, there is a shared document accessible by everyone in your team.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.600]   As tasks or questions come up that's relevant for the team, someone here needs to work on this. We
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.920]   need to look into updating the website. We have a client visit coming up. We need to start the
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.040]   process for getting our next quarterly reports running. Anything that comes up, here's a new
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.640]   obligation or question that someone or some subset of people on team have to work on,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.920]   you put it on the shared doc. And when you get to the docket clearing meeting, you go through that
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.920]   shared doc all together. So you're all there in the same room or on the same Zoom conference,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.960]   if it's a distributed remote company, and you go through the things one by one. Okay, this thing
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.000]   here. Is this important? Okay, who's going to do it? What do we need? Can we just do it right now?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.440]   Is it quick? Someone just do it. Oh, you're going to handle it. So what information do you need from
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.960]   who? Okay. And when are they going to get that to you? What form? Let me just, let's write this down
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.840]   in the shared docs. We have a record of it. Great. Next, next, next. And you go through each of these
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.520]   things and you resolve the questions assigned to work, do the small things right away. And people
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.480]   come out of the docket clearing meeting, you've cleared a lot of this work off your team's plate,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.800]   and the stuff that remains has been clarified. That discussion, a couple minutes of discussion
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.600]   that each task gets, gets rid of the need to have all these ambiguous back and forth emails,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.200]   you're playing obligation hot potato for a while until it gets urgent, you're not quite sure what's
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.360]   going to happen. It allows you to just execute the work. If you have a docket clearing meeting for
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.280]   30 minutes, twice a week, small footprint, 30 minutes, twice a week, same time, your whole team,
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.160]   you will reduce the number of emails each team member receives in their inbox by a factor of
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.840]   three or four. And not only will you reduce the number of emails by a big factor, but the type of
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.520]   email you're taking out of their inbox by having these meetings are the type that are the worst.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.040]   The ambiguous back and forth, the conversations, the like, could you deal with this? You don't
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.240]   even know what that means. The stuff that really gives you the indigestion,
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.920]   the stuff that causes the anxiety. So it is an incredibly effective tool. If you work in any
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.440]   sort of team, you should have docket clearing meetings. So there is my new piece of advice.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.080]   - I like it.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.960]   - That's actually in a slow productivity. I'm working on the book and so I have these principles
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.440]   and then the principles underneath the principles are propositions, which are kind of where we get
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.480]   concrete, like do work on this, work on that, or just give some more concrete ideas.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.680]   And so the propositions have, they come with some like actual pieces of advice. So some of the book
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.480]   is philosophical and manifesto style, some is idea writing, some is let's get concrete. And that came
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   out of me working on a proposition about containing the small things. So the footprint stays small
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.720]   in your work life. And that's, I was just working out the docket clearing meeting idea.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.160]   It's the, I presented that in the book as the team counterpart to office hours for the individual. So
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.560]   as you know, I'm a huge believer of you should have office hours three times a week. Everyone
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.960]   knows when they are. Almost anything smaller conversational or back and forth conversation
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.560]   requiring you to say, great, grab me at my office hours, grab me at my office hours. You're just
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.800]   defending people off. We have your shield of your office hours. You're just defending yourself as
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.560]   all these ambiguous obligation hand grenades come near you. You just knock them all away and just
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.120]   make everyone come every day. There's 30 minutes. They can always come and find you. And that's a
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.640]   huge inbox saver, but team stuff requires his own type of strategy. So there we go.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.200]   Docket clearing meetings. I've been thinking about slow bar activity a lot. Yeah. Just
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.960]   on different things I work on, whether it's like work or even getting better at sports. I think
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.400]   about it all the time. I finished the chapter. Well, the first draft of the chapter on doing
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.840]   fewer things. Principle one, it was a beast. It was 25,000 words. I got it down to 18,000 words
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.400]   out of my hands. My editor has it took me a long time. So I was trying to figure out the voice.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.000]   I think I found the voice for the book, but we'll knock on wood. We'll see.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.320]   So I've started now I'm working on a part one chapter. So part one is more like ideas.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.800]   So part one chapter that's I'm not going to give too many details because it might also be a New
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.880]   Yorker piece. So I like to keep that kind of secret and I'm beginning the background research
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:12.080]   for the next principle, which is work at a natural pace. And, you know, this, this idea of
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.920]   constant, like you just work, you know, five days a week, eight hours straight, just again and again
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.000]   and again, just going after getting after it, just intense. It's very unnatural. It doesn't
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.520]   really match the way that really interesting stuff is produced. I'm just getting the weeds there.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.080]   And I won't give too many details yet, but, but yesterday I was spending a lot of time reading
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:41.600]   about the timelines of famous scientists from the early Renaissance period. And let's just say the
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.800]   pace at which they developed and published their ideas is anything but fast. Like a year will go by
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.200]   that's not working on it. And then like the summer they work on it and then they have to send a
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.960]   letter and it's 15, 57, 67. So it's going to take, you know, three months before they hear back.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.080]   It's a slower pace. They're very productive because they invented, you know, gravity.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:14.800]   That's coming along. All right. Speaking of, I'm going to make this transition land.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.840]   Got a lot of really good analogies today.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.920]   Yeah. I'm trying to transition to sponsors.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.000]   I'm still thinking about the dragon going over the wall.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.720]   Yeah. Yeah. It'd be better if I knew the name of that character from game of Thrones.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.680]   I wish I knew it too.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:35.760]   It's not Cersei Lannister is the person in power, the wife of the Joffrey. They're the people in
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.320]   power, the queen of the dragons. I don't know. I don't know the show. The only thing I know
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.320]   about the show is someone sent me a clip, which I really enjoy. I guess there was an episode in
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.280]   the last season where it's this dragon woman and they're in a tavern and it's, I don't know,
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.760]   dwarves and swords and stuff. And someone left the Starbucks cup in there and it made it into the
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.920]   show. And it's, it's, it's fantastic. They're in this tavern and they're all in there and there's
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:06.160]   just a Starbucks cup sitting on the table. I appreciated that.
