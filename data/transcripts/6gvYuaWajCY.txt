[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.540]   kids don't seem to like certain vegetables, but they all are hardwired to like sweet tastes.
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.480]   And yet you could also imagine that one of the reasons why they may eventually grow to
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.920]   incorporate vegetables is because of some knowledge that vegetables might be better
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.920]   for them.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.860]   So is there a change in the receptors, the distribution, the number, the sensitivity,
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.580]   et cetera, that can explain the transition from wanting to avoid vegetables to being
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.060]   willing to eat vegetables, simply in childhood to early development?
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.360]   I want to take the question slightly differently, but I think it would illustrate the point.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.780]   And I want to just use the difference between the olfactory system and the taste system
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.740]   to make the point.
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.700]   Taste system, five basic palates, sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.940]   Each of them has a predetermined identity.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.820]   We know exactly what, and valence.
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.980]   These are attractive.
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.760]   These are aversive.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.660]   In the olfactory system, it's claimed that we can smell millions of different odors.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:20.340]   Yet for the most part, none of them have an innate predetermined meaning.
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.500]   In the olfactory system, meaning is imposed by learning and experience.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.740]   And the smell of smoke.
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.940]   So I'm going to give you, I'm going to make it differently.
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.840]   There are a handful of the millions of odors that were claimed that you could immediately
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.140]   tell me these are aversive and these are attractive.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.140]   Vomit.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.460]   So vomit, it's not correct because I can assure you that there are cultures and societies
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.380]   where things which are far less appealing than vomit do not evoke an aversive reaction.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.380]   Really?
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.380]   Really.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.260]   Sulfur would be maybe a universal.
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.260]   I'm not talking pheromones.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.260]   Okay?
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.940]   Pheromones are in a different category that trigger innate responses.
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.500]   But nearly every other is afforded meaning by learning and experience.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.200]   And that's why you like broccoli and I despise broccoli because I remember my mother forcing
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.540]   me to eat broccoli.
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.540]   I'm so sorry.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.380]   It's the same sensory experience.
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.380]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.380]   Alright.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.300]   This, this accommodates two important things.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.980]   In the case of taste, you have neurons at every station that are for sweet, for sour,
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.540]   for bitter, for salty and umami.
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.180]   It's only five classes.
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.380]   So it's not going to take a lot of your brain.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.700]   If we can in fact smell a million odors and every one of those odors had to have predetermined
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.020]   meaning, there's not going to be enough brain just to accommodate that one sense.
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:03.500]   And so evolution in its infinite wisdom, it evolve a system where you put together a pathway
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:14.060]   and a cortex, olfactory cortex, where you have the capacity to associate every other
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.560]   in a specific context that now gives it the meaning.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.100]   Now let's go back to the original question then.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:32.500]   So other than clearly plastic, mega plastic, because it's, it's fundamental basis and neural
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.620]   organization, but taste, we just told you that it's, you know, predetermined hardwire,
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.600]   but predetermined hardwire, it doesn't mean that it's not modulated by learning or experience.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:51.000]   It only means that you are born liking sweet and disliking bitter.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.500]   And we have many examples of plasticity, beer being one example.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.700]   So why do we learn to love beer?
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.300]   It's in coffee.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:10.180]   It's because it has an associated gain to the system and that gain to the system, that
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.580]   positive valence that emerges out of that negative signal is sufficient to create that
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.540]   positive association.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.980]   And in the case of beer, of course, it's alcohol.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.240]   The feeling good that we get after is more than sufficient to say, I want to have more
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.080]   of this.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.500]   And in the case of coffee, of course, it's caffeine activating a whole group of neurotransmitter
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.640]   systems that give you that, that, that high associated with coffee.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.340]   So yes, this taste system is changeable.
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.100]   It's malleable and is subjected to learning and experience, but unlike the olfactory system
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:58.160]   is restricted in what you could do with it because its goal is to allow you to get nutrients
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.840]   and survive.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.900]   The goal of the olfactory system is very different.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.560]   It's being used, not in our case, but in every animal species to, you know, identify friend
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:19.000]   versus foe, to identify mate, to identify ecological niches they want to be in.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So it plays a very broad role that then requires that it be set up, organized and function
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.980]   in a very different type of context.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.440]   Taste is about, can we get the nutrients we need to survive?
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.840]   And can we ensure that we are attracted to the ones we need and we are averse to the
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.360]   ones that are going to kill us?
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   [music]
