[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   We're gonna play a little bit of a word association game right now. I'm gonna say a word you think of the response. I
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.000]   say
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   survivalist you say
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.120]   Your answer to that question will reveal a lot about
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:22.160]   The way that you think and what you think the word and the term survival or survival list and survivalism. These are not
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.200]   popular terms today or are they
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.120]   After all turn on the TV or look at a newsstand and basically everywhere you see a survival show
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.280]   Well today we're gonna talk with one of the leaders in the modern-day survival movement a man named Jack Spirico
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.400]   He's founder of the survival podcast and most importantly
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.280]   He's one of the more sane and rational people that you'll hear talk about the topic of survivalism
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.240]   And today here's he he is here to teach you how to live a better life if times get tough or even if they don't
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:11.240]   (Music)

[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.280]   This is the show where each and every day we talk about how to live a rich life now and also how you can build a
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.960]   plan for financial freedom in ten years or less pay attention to the latter part of that actually both parts of that because
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.680]   Yet again, I'm bringing a guest on who lives a rich life and who has become financially free in less than ten years
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:50.080]   My guest is a man named Jack Spirico founder of the survival podcast one of the longest-running and most popular as far as I know
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   by far the most popular
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.000]   Podcast on survivalism
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.760]   He has about a hundred and fifty thousand people a day that tune in for him to talk about
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.720]   Concepts of modern survival and again how to live a better life if times get tough or even if they don't I've been a long
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.520]   Time fan of Jack's podcast
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.400]   I've had a long time interest in the topic of survival even as you'll hear
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.600]   Me mention in the beginning of the interview today
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.160]   And I've always just enjoyed Jack's content because he is a creative thinker who applies things in a careful and rational way
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.040]   He talks about tax planning within the context of planting a tree
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.840]   which I think is brilliant and as a tax planner and someone who talks day and there thinks a lot about how to
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.800]   Eliminate taxes. I always find that type of refresh
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.240]   Thinking refreshing so you're in for a treat. We try to cover a bunch of topics first in today's interview
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.960]   We cover a little bit of Jack's backstory with his business
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.800]   then we move into the topic of permaculture and lifestyle design as
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.600]   Seen through the lens of survivalism, and I hope you enjoy there's many many many important takeaways in today's interview before I play the interview

[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.280]   I've mentioned on my show before but I'll tell you right here at the start of the interview that
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.880]   Probably the survival podcast has influenced the way I designed radical personal finance probably more than any other show
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.980]   Out there that I listened to and I owe you a debt of gratitude for your work in that regard. So, thank you
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.640]   Hey, man, that's why I do what I do
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.160]   Whatever I can do to help people to get their own thing going is the it's really the biggest motivating factor
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.580]   I have in my life. Awesome
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.460]   So I'd like to start briefly with a little bit of the backstory because on radical personal finance
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.720]   we talk a lot about entrepreneurship and love for you to tell the business story of
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.940]   How you came to start a podcast and treat it as a business and then we'll get to the main topic of our interview
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.380]   Sure. Well, I mean I was living the American dream, which means I was on my way to a heart attack by 50 at the latest
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.580]   probably
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.340]   I had kind of built a career from nothing. I never went to college or anything like that
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:22.460]   But through a combination of luck and hard work. I had managed to move into a sales position in my early 20s. I
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.060]   Broke that six-figure barrier by the time I was 26
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.580]   once I did that no one really cared about a degree so I'd become successful in a
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.380]   In the sales world moved into a VP of sales position for a very large company called fluke
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.460]   which many of your folks out there probably would have heard of us a Northeast regional VP of sales for fluke fluke networks and
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.980]   But that wore me out on the travel
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:52.180]   so eventually my family and I decided we had moved to Pennsylvania for this to go back to Texas where my family was from and
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.180]   We came back down here and I took a position in a marketing position for a fraction of what I
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.700]   Had been making
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.220]   previously, but it was a way to no longer travel and
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.220]   Kind of that led through another progression to where I ended up starting my own marketing company
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.140]   So I went from being basically the the son of a coal miner
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.940]   making minimum wage straight out of the army to eventually
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.680]   rising up through various sales positions in telecommunications
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.620]   breaking that six-figure barrier at about 26 and
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.180]   ended up is the regional vice president of sales in the Northeast region of a company called fluke networks and
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:41.200]   there a division of the company that most people know of is just fluke that if you see the electricians with the
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.580]   Yellow multimeters that's that's fluke. So that gives you an idea the size of the company
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:52.860]   It's a 500 million dollar company and I was there their top salesperson in the in the world as the Northeast regional sales
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.140]   VP and I
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:02.100]   Hated parts of that job though. I hated sitting down to lunches and dinners with people that I really
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.680]   Wouldn't walk across the street for if I didn't have to and I hated the travel
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:13.900]   You know 9/11 I was in Pittsburgh. My family was in Eastern, Pennsylvania. I couldn't get home to him
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.100]   I'm listening to my wife cry on the phone. My kids scared
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.360]   He's asking me if a war can come here things like that and I'm not home
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.740]   So I held on for their couple years after 9/11 and eventually we decided to come back to Texas when we came back to, Texas
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.620]   I I
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:34.140]   Didn't want to be in this kind of gig anymore work because the money in sales is in travel
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.340]   So I switched from sales to marketing and I had gotten very good at internet marketing
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.180]   During the the the tech bubble burst of the early 2000s
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.540]   I had taken up using internet marketing to get leads for my own salespeople to put people into
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:53.540]   Seats at seminars and things like that and I had started selling things like long-distance service and things like that
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.420]   So I'd gotten really good at internet marketing
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.980]   Especially back in those days if you knew what you were doing you you could drive a hole through the search engines and their algorithms
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.940]   so I went to work for a search engine marketing firm and ended up as their director of search marketing and
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.940]   It was okay, but it paid a fraction of what I had made before
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:19.100]   I took a step back to go forward ended up with a company called sage telecom as their as their director of internet marketing
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.660]   And they were acquired by another company. So I was like, I'm so sick of this and I had a friend
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:29.820]   Named Neil Franklin who had said, you know, I want to do something with you. So we founded a marketing firm together
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.860]   Called Franklin Spirko
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.900]   We even at one time had Donald Trump as one of our clients kind of ironic that the guys were president now
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.900]   I wouldn't vote for him if you put a gun to my head
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.980]   But I was pretty proud of that at the time
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.060]   But but in the end I had just got to the point where I was I was over 300 pounds
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.060]   I was I was still dealing, you know with all the climate at client entertainment stuff. I was miserable. I was unhappy
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.580]   We've got this client that said I want to do a blog and a podcast and all this other stuff
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.180]   So I'm like, okay cool
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.460]   So I put the bid in for it and we won the job and I take it to my lead developer and I said hey Bobby
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.460]   I want you to to build this all out
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.620]   He says I can do all this stuff
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.660]   But I don't know anything about podcasts and RSS feeds and stuff like that and I'm like, well, I'll figure that out
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.540]   So I took this $18 Plantronics headset that had tape on it. So it would work
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.300]   And a $30 mp3 player because I didn't care right?
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.180]   It was just like I gotta figure out how this works and I plugged it in
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:26.140]   I did episode one of the survival podcast that was in June of 2008 and because of my relationship with Neil
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:31.580]   I had a lot of insight to the financial industry that people with a standard consumer level financial advisor
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.860]   don't I think there was a pretty big telegraph punch coming with that recession, but I
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.220]   really knew like a lot of times I say things financially like I
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.780]   Think I'm pretty sure
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.060]   My estimation is in 2008
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.820]   All I was doing was going get out of the market get out of the market get out
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:54.100]   There's a truck coming get out of the market and I started that show and that was like one of my first main themes was
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.620]   Was you know financial preparedness and I went into all different walks of preparedness
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.940]   We talked a lot about things like doing drills to understand how weak you really were and stuff like that
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.300]   And in the first six months, we're going from June to December of that first year. I got about
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.620]   2,500 listeners and at that point I was like
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:17.140]   You know what? I can make this my walk away from the world. I hate business
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.500]   a year later at 18 months was when I first monetized the show and
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.380]   we brought in like
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:32.660]   $10,000 in the first week that I monetized the show some and my wife was excited and she's like you're gonna do it
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.540]   You're gonna be able to quit your job like next week and I'm like, no
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.300]   No, cuz that's not gonna you know, we got a we got to build this now and
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.940]   I built it for another year in a year and a half. I did I walked away
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.340]   Completely walked away sold out my interest in the other companies to my partners
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.980]   Who thought I was just bat shit crazy, by the way, like how are you gonna make a living at podcasting?
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.500]   well, I'm already doing it so I think I'll just keep doing that and
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.740]   The show kind of took off from there and we we went from you know
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.040]   2,500 listeners at the end of that first, you know half year and we were like
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.940]   2025,000 the end of that next year and today we have a hundred fifty thousand people a day downloading the show and
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.540]   if you put that in perspective the
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:19.060]   The the city of Allentown has about you know in its whole metro area has about a hundred thousand people
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.900]   so we're one and a half times the size of Allentown, Pennsylvania just in an online radio show and
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.500]   We've gone into just every facet and walk of life in preparedness and self-sufficiency
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:37.460]   Independence and Liberty, I mean that's that's what the show is really all about and though it's called a survival podcast
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.980]   And we do talk about preparedness. We talk about bug out bags. We talk about you know
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:48.260]   prepared for being prepared for anything from a financial collapse to a storm, but we
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:54.780]   It's really more of a variety show if it has to do with taking control of your own life taking control of your own money
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.420]   Being prepared to do without systems of support
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:02.100]   providing your own food taking care of your community we talk about it and I
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.860]   Think it really is the first thing like it that was ever created
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.220]   I wish I could say, you know that I sat down
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:15.820]   Josh and said I'm gonna make this show that I'm gonna start with this survival hook and financial hook and I'm gonna turn it into
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.820]   This giant variety show on Liberty and Independence and that was the plan all along
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.560]   I was flying by the seat of my pants in the beginning
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.020]   but I had a work ethic that I didn't know how to let go of being the son of a coal miner and
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:35.060]   During those first year and a half when I still had you understand I didn't just have a company I owned I was serving as
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.060]   a chief operational officer
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:43.140]   For one of Neal's other companies and a chief marketing officer for another company
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.980]   So I had three companies that I was I was sitting at sea level positions in at the same time
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.060]   I didn't exactly have a lot of free time
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.540]   But I would get up at three o'clock in the morning when my wife was still asleep
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:57.520]   I would go down to my home office and I would set up my show for the day. I would record it in my car
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.180]   I would get to the office. I'd lock my door. So everybody leave me alone for ten minutes
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.260]   I would upload it and I'd walk away from it and I would answer questions when I got home that evening and
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.840]   That's what it took. But after a year and a half of doing that I decided
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.820]   What could I do if I actually dedicated my life to this and that's how it became the success that it is
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.180]   It's an awesome story and it just shows how
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:26.980]   Sometimes just simply by being out there and being active you can really find new opportunities and and life is not I don't know
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.620]   But I mean none of my life has really been all that perfectly planned
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.180]   It's just been a matter of a lot of action and a lot of hustle and then all of a sudden you start to connect
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.180]   the dots and in in reverse
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.300]   when you look at
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.180]   survivalism
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:47.820]   As a topic the thing that makes you different because I grew up with an interest in you know
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.100]   I would read the SAS survival handbook when I was a kid
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.160]   I remember that was one of the first books that that I would that was the first type of book that I would buy
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.860]   When I was a kid and I always grew it up. I'd read these Ragnar Benson like weird fringe
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.640]   survivalist books, but a lot of that stuff doesn't apply over to
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.380]   to
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.420]   Real life and when you're looking at the world of survivalism
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:17.380]   There are so many kind of hardcore fringe kooks where it's just I guess kooks is not very nice
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:23.220]   There's some people that don't seem to be connected to the reality that I see and one thing I've appreciated about you
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.500]   Is that you seem to be firmly anchored in reality while also?
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.860]   Aware of the fact that reality is changing over time
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:39.260]   Where did you find your perspective or how did you develop your perspective with regard to your survivalism philosophy?
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.300]   Well when I started the show
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.340]   Part of it was just being genuine who I am
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:53.460]   And the other part of it was I was a marketer and I knew the preparedness industry
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:58.620]   Was about to explode I knew there were a lot of things going on that were concerning people
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.500]   I knew that the recession I saw coming was gonna create opportunity there
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.540]   It got actually bigger than I expected with stupid shows like doomsday preppers and all these other horribly
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:13.620]   Stupid non-reality TV shows and that helped so I wanted to be able to be in that niche
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:21.780]   But I think it's important that people need to understand that you can have an astute understanding of marketing and an astute
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.940]   understanding of being in the right niche and
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:29.340]   Still be true to who you are and if you can do the two together you have a recipe for success
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:34.540]   So I chose the angle of what we were gonna do based on that
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.500]   So as much as I was flying by the seat of my pants
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.060]   It was also this intrinsic
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:44.540]   You know when you do sales and marketing work for 20 years for large companies you get a little bit good at it
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.540]   So there was a little bit of a foreknowledge
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:52.900]   In positioning there now the other thing that I wanted to do is I didn't want to compete
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:58.740]   With you know the preparedness board at Backwoods home magazine, though. You know I love their magazine
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:04.380]   I'm just saying I didn't want to I didn't want to go out and I and try to capture a piece of a defined market
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.420]   I actually wanted to create a market
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.380]   And I thought the best way to do that was to make preparedness
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:16.620]   Something that people would go well gee I kind of have to be stupid and irresponsible not to do this
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.340]   So I came up with what I called modern survivalism and that word in
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:27.900]   Phrases everywhere now, and I can't prove that I was the first person to ever use it in any kind of a real thing
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.380]   But when I decided on it what I did is I went to Google, and I put you know
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.460]   quote
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:42.380]   Modern survivalism end quote so you get an exact math search on Google. I came up with zero results at the time so I was like
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.700]   Okay, that's what I'm gonna anchor down on and then I decided well
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.380]   I'm gonna define what that is so then I went totally radical and said to myself
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:55.060]   Okay, now you should come up with a tagline to go with the survival podcast. It's the worst tagline in the world
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:18:02.740]   Because it'll be clunky and long and ridiculous, but it'll actually be wonderful because it'll it'll make people go
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.100]   Gee how would I say no to that so what I came up with was?
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:11.500]   Helping you live a better life if times get tough or even if they don't
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.620]   now
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.180]   You do have to have a little bit soft point in the skull to say well
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.220]   I don't want that I mean just just think about that judge right hey
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:26.940]   I'm gonna give you a way to live a better life if times get really bad and even if they don't
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:32.980]   You'll still be better off. I'm not interested. Okay. I think you need to have a doctor check you out or something
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:39.660]   So that was the strapline and then I built this 12-point modern survival philosophy off of that and the first ten of that that guided
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:45.420]   Everything was every single thing that you do to prepare for disasters and emergencies in the future
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:50.100]   Should improve the quality and stability of your life even if nothing goes wrong
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.540]   So it was the first tenant was a restatement of the strapline
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:59.060]   And I can tell you there were tons of people that came into what we were doing with a little bit of trepidation
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.540]   And when they heard that it was over they were like okay
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:09.100]   This is something I can get behind and because of that they were able to share it with other people
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.620]   without being
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.900]   accused of looking for black helicopters flying around in their underpants or hiding a hole in the ground or something like that because it made a
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.900]   very soft way so
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.660]   Once I had that tenant down
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:27.460]   All I did was just look at the average American and go why do so many people?
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.300]   Every time something is a hiccup in life get their ass completely kicked
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:38.140]   and I walked through it and what it came out to be is you know you mentioned Ragnar and stuff like that and how a
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.420]   Lot of the things in the the wilderness survival don't translate
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:48.580]   They actually translate perfectly if you look at them with the right viewpoint so if I was going to teach a class on
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:55.860]   Basic wilderness survival I'm going to talk about your five primary survival needs food water
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.860]   Fire is what they'll call it
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.260]   shelter and security and
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.980]   Because wilderness survival is a short-term thing
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.780]   The last one gets left out health and sanitation
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.340]   Well when I looked at the average American
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.740]   I realized that
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:19.200]   Those six things were always the places they got knocked down even when something happened that you didn't think of as being you know a
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.660]   Cataclysm something that you would hear about on Tuesday preppers if somebody if somebody lost a job
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.740]   And they weren't prepared to lose a job well
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:33.140]   You start worrying about the grocery bills and whether or not you can keep a house where there's food and shelter right there
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:38.460]   And then of course you know health and sanitation you no one can afford Cobra right?
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:44.540]   So if you started going down that list eventually you realize they were all common and the one thing that was a little bit different
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.660]   Was money doesn't do you any good in the woods?
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:52.100]   Right unless you happen along to find some kind of trading post or something like that
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.900]   Money's useless in the woods. Maybe you could burn and keep warm for five seconds
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:03.540]   But in in the actual functioning economy the functioning world that we all live in money bought all those things
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.820]   But then I started looking at how people buy those things we buy them all
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:15.380]   100% a la carte and what I mean by that is we pay our electric bill every month we pay our food bill every month and
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.580]   We sell them by more than we need while it's more affordable
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:26.740]   We sell them think about what if I wasn't able to buy it and and these radical ideas these radical preparedness ideas
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.060]   Really weren't that radical one of the tenants
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.700]   I used to explain this in the in the formative years was
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:38.420]   Look at all the airlines that were in distress back then and I would say you know the one airline is still making money
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:44.940]   Southwest Airlines, do you know why they buy their fuel in mass contracts when fuel prices plummet?
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:52.020]   So when the fuel prices spiked and all the other airlines went nuts and then uses an excuse to charge charges for bags and everything
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.700]   Southwest went Nick don't care bought our fuel last year
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:22:00.380]   This is a way of creating a cap on capital expenditures
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:06.480]   and taking an unknown into a fixed known and that we could emulate these same things in our lives by
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.100]   Buying more food than we needed when it was on a lower cost when it was on sale when we had a coupon
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.780]   Simple things like that and then understanding so now I have a stockpile now the convenience
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.620]   So I never have to go over to my neighbors and go. Hey, man
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.180]   Can I borrow a cup of sugar or something like that?
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:27.780]   Right, we have basically our own little mini store in our preparedness here in our home
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:34.900]   So it's a convenience, but it doesn't cost us any more money. Generally speaking. What direction does the cost of food go over time?
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:43.580]   Generally up so if I buy more now and use it later rate their inflation alone and until we move into a deflationary curve
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.580]   Which I think we're still quite a ways away from
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:53.580]   That that that that game works every single time. So these it wasn't just like this one idea
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.100]   It was all of these little pieces and parts that were assembled together to build
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.460]   Resiliency into our lives in a way that when you explained it to somebody they'd go. Oh
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:09.560]   Well, of course that makes perfect sense and you can imagine my chagrin when they had like the I can't remember what it's called now
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.660]   But like the coupon reality show come out and like all the things we were talking about
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:20.220]   There by the way, those shows are just BS like you can't do it at the level they do it
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.540]   But the basic tenants of what they're talking about stacking things
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:29.280]   Buying more when they're looking for a sale and matching a coupon up to it and I I'll be honest
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.420]   I can't say that I spent a lot of time clipping coupons
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.440]   It's not the best use of my time
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.040]   But when we go into a store and we see something that has a long shelf life
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.840]   That we use anyway, and it's on sale
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.680]   We buy the hell out of it and we just put it into our storage in our pantry and you know
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.040]   Silvers at like 16 bucks. It was kind of creeping way way down
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:53.280]   We may be looking for a major drop in commodity prices beyond what we've already seen
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.880]   Put somebody emailed me the other day and said given you were saying to buy silver when it was $25
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.760]   If it if it goes to $7, what will you do then? I said I might be on the roof dancing naked happy
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.360]   Because I'll be I hope he'll be loading up on some silver at seven bucks
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.400]   And you just change your whole paradigm about the way you look at things
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.720]   If you're living like so you actually have to do you have to kind of live like
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.880]   We're in a deflationary economy, even though we're not
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.240]   So if you were in an inflationary economy debt makes sense
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:29.380]   But you have to stay away from debt because sooner or later debt will burn you if you're in a deflationary economy
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.480]   It makes sense to save because if you say versus risk
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.720]   The strength of the currency is is retained
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.440]   But what you figure out is if I start figuring out ways to create more and more inflows of currency
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.640]   It doesn't make sense to put it at risk
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.400]   What it makes us to do is spend the energy instead of figuring out which is my next financial play
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:52.600]   To actually go out and say how can I generate more income? What can I do online? What can I do with my existing business?
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:58.040]   How can I expand the value of what I have? How can I create wealth that the government can't tax?
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.040]   That sounds crazy, right?
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:06.720]   But I've put in over 400 fruit trees on my property the value of that 10 years from now it is
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:12.200]   incredible compared to the cost but how does a government tax an orange tree or
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:19.080]   Tax a pecan tree or tax, you know an edible dogwood that they don't even understand that such a thing exists
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.640]   There's no way to do that
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   There's no way that my property
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:29.080]   Actually gets accurately assessed in the future until the day that I decide to sell it and actually send a professional in
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.960]   To assess it that way a county tax assessor can't get their arms around the way
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.380]   I've improved my property all of these things have cumulated together to be you know
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:43.000]   You're asking me try to condense the whole philosophy. That's been almost 1800 episodes now down into a few minutes
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.600]   So hopefully that help I know it's kind of long but that's kind of where we're coming from
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.760]   I think it's it's valuable and one of the things that I've learned is that when you face a problem
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.240]   Sometimes facing the problem direct head-on is a good way to approach it
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.160]   But a lot of times you just need to look a little bit left and look a little bit right and come at it from a
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.720]   lateral perspective and so all of the principles that you just talked about I think are
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:08.040]   Are the key they they
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:15.200]   Involve creativity they involve you looking and saying how can I provide for my actual needs in a way?
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.800]   That's creatively appropriate to my situation
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:23.960]   I want to ask you about the starting place and then want to move to permaculture as a financial plan
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:29.600]   Pretend for a moment that I am an average median income 30 year old
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:36.640]   Father of a family. I've got two kids, you know, I've got two young kids and I'm looking around and saying hey
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.920]   I'm concerned about the economy because I got lots of questions like this
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.840]   Economic doom and gloom is a common theme if you were giving me a roadmap
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.800]   How would you tell me to approach starting to make a plan for my own family's security and well-being?
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:27:01.040]   Well, I mean the first place I'm gonna start is eliminating the cancer in America of debt like I
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.600]   Don't want to talk to you about your investments other than protect your wealth
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:10.460]   So we're just gonna take your money and unless you really know exactly why you have it leveraged the way that you do
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.480]   We're gonna deleverage it
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:17.400]   We're gonna put it in completely as safe as we can make it and then you're gonna bust your ass until you have no more debt
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.440]   And we don't even need it. We don't need to worry about anything else
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.440]   And if you have to go out and deliver pizzas
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:28.680]   Is a part-time job in the evening for the next couple is the number one priority and before we do that
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:34.960]   We're gonna stockpile a couple thousand dollars in an emergency fund first and we're gonna have that
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.080]   So when the car breaks down or whatever, this is very Dave Ramsey ish
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:44.280]   Okay, and that this is where Dave Ramsey and I part ways at the end of this this debt snowball type thing
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.800]   We're gonna pay off all the debt starting on the smallest debt. We're gonna pay that one off
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   We're gonna roll it to the next one and we're gonna do that and you're gonna watch that cascade happen. And when you decide that
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   nothing else
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.680]   matters right now, but that
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.380]   You'll take debt that you think is gonna take you 10 years to pay off
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.580]   You'll pay it off in two or less
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.440]   My wife and I did this and we did it after I left the big paying job
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.800]   So people go that's easy to pay off debt when you're making, you know, six figures or whatever
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.660]   I we decided that we had screwed up and we needed to do something about this. I was making
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.240]   $45,000 a year. We had
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.080]   $38,000 in consumer debt. We paid it off in 18 months
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:27.880]   My wife's a nurse so you can imagine that right you can imagine that she wasn't exactly rolling in the Benjamins either
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   she's an LVN so like you're not even an RN like, you know a
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.840]   Pediatric nurse at the time she now works for me
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.060]   But at the time, you know
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.360]   She was I think she's making 15 bucks an hour or something like that and we were able to do that in 18 months
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.900]   Why we decided that we could have all the nights out
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.620]   We wanted all the nice bottles of wine
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.060]   We wanted all of that stuff as soon as we were done with this first
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:54.040]   and I remember the day we paid off the last bit of that debt we owed $3,800 on a truck and
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:59.980]   That was a kind of our last bit of it. We got the thing in the mail and I said, oh 3,800 bucks
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.280]   Hell we got that in the bank account. Just write a check pay it off
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.980]   She's like, I don't know if I want to spend all that money right now
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.660]   I'm like, well if the truck was zero and the bank offered to give us $3,800 of
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.540]   Of it credit against it. Would you take the money?
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:18.100]   She goes damn it just wrote the check, you know, and we got the title a couple days later that
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:23.580]   Will take all of that fear all of that angst and just set it up on the shelf
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.340]   It'll still be there a little bit, but it won't be on your back
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.900]   It'll be on the shelf in the back of the room. So that's number one get that done. Then the next thing
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.820]   Start becoming a saver. I
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.940]   Hear people all the time. I have $5,000. What do I need to invest in?
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:45.900]   $100 bills $20 bills $50 bills, but I'm worried about inflation. You're not worried about inflation, right? You have $5,000
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.700]   You're not worried about inflation. You're worried about more money save your money
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.500]   Don't even don't even worry about investing
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:58.500]   rejectedly crap until you have at least $30,000 saved up in cash and
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:06.220]   When you get there, this is the difference when you say to yourself, okay now I want to look for places to invest my money
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.100]   you will be
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:14.340]   Extremely conservative with that money. You will look at that money and you will say my number one duty is to protect that money
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:19.460]   Where we've been convinced in America our number one duty with our money is to grow our money
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:25.100]   No, you can't grow something once it's been devalued or wiped out
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:31.340]   So we should come at the approach of investing with how do I protect myself from losses?
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:36.060]   Way too deep a topic to get into today kind of get a technical trading and stuff like that
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:40.820]   But I promise you if you save $30,000 in cash before you invest your money
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:46.380]   You'll figure it out because it'll matter to you where if it just goes in that automatic drip from your employer
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:51.740]   And they give you your 1% match or whatever the hell it is now and you're off in these five little things you can pick
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:57.020]   From and all of them suck in general and you have no way to safeguard your money because they've removed the cash option for most
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:03.060]   All the 401ks now forcing us into government debt is our conservative option there. You just kind of look at it
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:08.260]   It's like well that just happened. It's like Social Security. It's like a someday thing and you don't really own it
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:13.180]   So own that savings and then I would say once you get there
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:17.820]   It's probably time to try to find a good financial advisor unless you want to become
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:23.300]   Financially astute yourself, which I would prefer but I know a lot of people are not going to but I'm gonna be honest with you
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.540]   It's gonna be very difficult
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:30.540]   It's gonna be extremely difficult for a person with a hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollars invest to find a financial advisor
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:38.420]   That's that's any good because most of the really good financial advisors work with accredited investors that have net worths in excess of a million dollars
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:46.220]   But there's advisors like that that take people on kind of is is almost like apprentice protege types
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.140]   And say if I help this guy now when he's doing a little better
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:55.140]   He'll stick with me and you can sometimes find that or you just become a student as yourself
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.300]   You learn how to protect your profits
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:02.120]   What people need to learn to do is if you own a security and it makes you?
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:08.460]   15% and you've set a goal to make 7% a year. You just made two years take the profits
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:15.380]   Now and that gives you two years to figure out the next cherry-picked place to put that money
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:19.660]   What does everybody do dollar cost average don't worry about don't time the market. Don't be a traitor
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.500]   You know what? You end up being the guy that gets crushed like everybody else when the market falls
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:30.660]   So you kind of take that conservative protective approach to your investing but begin to broaden your horizons at that point, too
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:37.300]   I think it makes a lot of sense to own property, but don't be stupid. Don't buy property. That's overvalued. Don't buy trendy neighborhoods
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:43.380]   Don't buy good schools. I love people. Well, I moved here because the schools are better. My response is always better at what indoctrination?
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.940]   programming statism
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:53.020]   Worship of the government. What exactly are those schools better at if you can if you can
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.900]   Self-educate your children put them into self-directed learning homeschool unschool
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.620]   Whatever you want to call it if you can't if you have to rely on the government schools
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.620]   Start that folks never call them public schools
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.120]   They're not public schools Sears is a public shopping place. Okay
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:13.900]   Albertsons is a public supermarket. You can go there as a member of the public and buy stuff
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:18.700]   It's open to the public a school run by our government is a government school
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.980]   That'll change your thinking right there
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:26.760]   If you have to rely on government schools commit as a parent to spending an hour educating your children every day
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.740]   Don't give me the bullshit. You can't do it
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.260]   You can spend an hour educating your children to counterbalance the nonsense
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.940]   They're being taught in schools and you'll learn more by teaching than they'll learn by having you teach them
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.460]   So you'll be teaching yourself at the same time
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.380]   Take that kind of approach as well and begin to start
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:46.780]   Investing if you can afford it and buy a piece of property buy something a half acre or larger
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:53.740]   Start producing your own food plant perennial plantings start to invest in your land. Stop looking at a
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:34:00.820]   Home as an asset when most homes are actually liabilities and start realizing when I first purchase a home
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.300]   If I do so with debt
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   I have in fact purchased a liability and my goal now is to begin the conversion process of transmitting that liability into an asset
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:15.580]   assets generate profit not necessarily direct cash profits
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:20.120]   But if we can start taking our home and start to remove our dependence on energy
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:25.300]   By starting at efficiency first and alternative energy second start producing some of our own food
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.780]   Improve the underlying value of the property if we can do that
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:35.420]   We can actually turn the home into a homestead and that's a very very powerful thing and it's something you actually have to ask yourself
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.060]   Why don't we even hear that anymore?
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.780]   Why doesn't anybody talk that way anymore because it's not good for the consumer driven economy
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:48.420]   What people are taught to do now and you know this find a small home buy it as a starter home
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:54.100]   Wait for the equity value to increase sell it capture the equity move to another house a little bit bigger
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.220]   Do it again do it two or four times?
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:59.940]   Then you finally get your dream home in your 50s by the way a 30-year mortgage
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.460]   You're gonna be there 80s before it's paid off
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:08.460]   Just saying and then when you get there take out a giant home equity loan and go on vacation and put a pool in
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:15.180]   Where what we should be taught to do is is buy very smart the very first time and make a lifelong
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:20.700]   investment in that property and do so in a way that clouds up the
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:28.500]   assessment that the government puts on the value of that property to mitigate your property taxes and then pay that property off as quickly as
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.660]   you can and once you have a debt-free life a
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.780]   stable family
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.020]   You've prepared for the basics of emergencies
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:42.100]   You can go 30 to 60 days if if somebody took your keys away from you locked you in your house
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:46.160]   You might be uncomfortable. You might smell a little bad, but you'd be okay 60 days later
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:53.940]   You get to that point, you know, you're educating your children to true education based on the trivium of grammar rhetoric and logic
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.700]   You own your home. All you have to be able to cover is the property taxes, which yes are theft
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:04.660]   But it's a function of modern reality all of a sudden now you have all of this boldness
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:09.740]   So what people do is they act bold when they're afraid if that makes sense
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:15.700]   So bold is I'm risking my life savings every week with no idea what the hell is going on because it's my 401k and the the
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:20.100]   Shiny guy in the suit that came and told me to said it's okay and not to worry cuz I'm young even though I'm 40
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:25.980]   Right, so you're acting bold when you're afraid you don't understand everything when you actually take this approach
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.140]   What you become is very informed very conservative yet at the same time
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:36.460]   You become very bold you pick and choose your risks and that allows you to do crazy things like start a podcast in your car
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:42.820]   Right or or whatever it is that you do and I think that would be the most important thing somewhere in all of this
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.820]   Find your passion and build a business based on it
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.980]   There has never been a time in history
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:54.820]   Where it's easier to build a business from the ground up from nothing to something than right now
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.860]   Anybody that thinks the heyday of the entrepreneur is over has not paid attention
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:06.380]   My business could not exist without the internet your podcast. This is becoming its own business could not exist without the internet. I
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:11.300]   Believed that I could build a website on anything and make a profit
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.260]   Maybe not a giant one
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:19.140]   But I believe I could make a profit with a website dedicated to nothing but funnels if I had to and I'm not talking about
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.060]   Sales funnels. I'm talking about plastic and aluminum funnels
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:25.660]   I could make a profitable website now it might make 20 bucks a month
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.580]   But let that sink in that you could take something completely
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:36.420]   Preposterous and for a couple bucks in hosting and a little bit of acquired knowledge make a profit with it
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.340]   I can't remember his name
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:43.060]   But the guys the president of Alibaba the drop shipping import company from China said if you live in America
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.900]   And you're not wealthy by your 30s today. It's your own fault
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:52.060]   It might be a bit of an oversimplification, but I believe there's real truth to it because again
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.140]   You're talking to a guy that when I got out of the army back in
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:03.300]   1993 my first job was packing boxes in a warehouse. It was a hundred and thirty degrees for five dollars and ten cents an hour
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.420]   I was 21 years old and by the time I was 26 years old
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.940]   I was making over a hundred thousand dollars here never saw the inside of a college classroom
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.860]   And it was nothing but hard work
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:18.620]   And I'm telling you if what exists today existed then if you could start a podcast
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:25.460]   Back then if you could build websites and generate money the way that you can today back then if you could take something like
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:32.020]   Homesteading and do all your homesteading stuff put it on YouTube and actually generate an income off of it existed in the 1990s
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:35.980]   I would have never spent any time, you know traveling all over the country meeting people
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.500]   I didn't want I would have done that from ground zero
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:44.180]   That's the opportunity that exists today. It's not easy. It's not easy
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:44.860]   It's hard
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:51.140]   But it's simple and the difference is easy something that anybody can do even by accident
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:58.780]   Simple is something you can do if you really want to and and that's the truth. It is a simple thing, but it's not easy
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:05.780]   Jack you've become an expert a noted expert in the field of permaculture and I watched your
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:11.660]   transition I believe you were the original your show was the original place where I heard the term and
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.420]   Really captured my interest and attention pretty intensely
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.700]   I'd like to talk about
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.140]   designing a lifestyle using permaculture principles and
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:29.540]   Let's do a scenario because I think it's useful in the modern world
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:36.940]   To have a kind of a pie-in-the-sky scenario just just imagine I sent you an eager young man or woman
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:43.940]   You know 15 16 years old 18, whatever age early early adulthood without any hang-ups
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:48.520]   No student loan debt anything like that. Now we're giving you a brush
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.300]   and I'd like you to paint out kind of a just a
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.340]   independently wealthy self-sufficient lifestyle bait based upon
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:40:03.300]   Integrating the natural world with the financial world and good design to minimize total lifetime costs, etc
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.180]   Basically, I want you to design Zaytuna farms in in Australia
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:07.780]   Okay
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:14.100]   Because that's I mean that's okay that I always that I always have in my head of what Jeff Lawton has built as a tuna farms
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:19.580]   And I look at I look at his property tours and things like that and I think why on earth
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:24.220]   Did someone not teach me how to do this type of thing when I was 15 years old?
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:31.000]   So if you were gonna teach somebody how to approach lifestyle design from a permaculture perspective, how would you do that?
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.140]   Well, I think you have to balance that with the desires of the person
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.740]   So I'm gonna assume for your example that this young person actually
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.540]   Wants to have some level of their living come from the land
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:51.140]   Directly because all of our livings come from the land all of our every resource we have is a natural resource every
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:58.580]   Everything of value if you trace it back came from some sort of a natural resource whether it's an ore or something grown from
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:04.660]   Soil or wood or energy that's harvested from the earth, but this person wants what you're talking about
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:10.260]   They want to be able to walk out their back door and graze their breakfast on the way to the chicken coop or the duck
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.100]   the duck holding area
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:17.020]   If that's the case, and I think that the first thing that people see is a huge impediment is
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.900]   access to property
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:24.380]   You can do some pretty amazing things with a quarter acre or less
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:30.820]   I actually think that like a quarter to a half of an acre for a lot of people's the sweet spot because it will make
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.820]   you focus on
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:37.860]   Efficiency I own a three acre property and I'll be honest with you. I think at my level
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:43.620]   I'd be pretty happy if it was 30 and I could deal with 300 though. I'd probably develop 30 and leave
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.820]   270 is hunting land. So you've got to crack that nut first. So if they're 18
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:53.220]   That can be a problem or the problem can be the solution. So that's a permaculture principle
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:57.940]   The problem is a solution. So if you were that young you didn't have money
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:03.380]   You didn't have somebody leaving you a farm and you didn't want to go to work as a wage slave and you wanted to learn
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:10.260]   The skill set at the same time that you were developing enough financial capability to be able to actually acquire land that you could own long-term
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:14.260]   I would say to look at something like Curtis stones doing with urban farming
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:19.060]   This is a form of spin farming where what he's doing is he goes into neighborhoods that are located in the right location
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:24.980]   And most people could afford to figure out some way to rent a flat or whatever you got to do to live close to that
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:31.340]   Location he goes to homeowners and he says hey, how about this? I farm your backyard. I pay you a lease rate on it and
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:36.220]   Here's what it'll look like and he has an incredible book on this by the way
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:42.860]   It's called the urban farmer and basically he's farming without owning any land and he did that for about four years
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.380]   And by the time he was done with that he ended up buying one of the houses
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.020]   That he had been farming. So all the work was done there already
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.380]   so that put him straight into a business model and
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:58.100]   Income and a skill development because if you don't you'll develop the skill because if you don't you get really hungry and really cold and really
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.060]   Tired right?
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:04.580]   so so that would be one way into it if you had a job and
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:11.340]   You were looking to kind of edge your way into this then I would say you got to look at buying the right property
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.340]   I'd really recommend you get over to Jeff Lawton comm and take a look at some of his
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.780]   free videos and
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:23.540]   The property walkthrough and focusing on three things with property when you're developing a property
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.780]   It doesn't matter if it's a little property or a big one water access and structure
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:34.220]   So we want to do a good property assessment when we're buying a piece of property if you take kind of the approach of spin
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.740]   Farming or leasing land or whatever first
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:41.020]   You're gonna do that anyway by that because you're gonna have the experience if you're gonna go straight in
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:48.620]   You really need to think about that and I would try if I were 18 19 years old want to do this
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.580]   I would think about a lot of different ways to do it and see that's the thing
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.940]   There's not a single answer to this
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:59.220]   One of the things you might very well do is is rent rent out your labor in the construction field if you can find and
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:06.500]   Travel to do it, you know, they're building houses somewhere frame drywall, whatever work for nothing work for crap gain the skill set
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.900]   Build a small house or a tiny house on a piece of land own it debt-free
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.140]   Start out that way
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.140]   So you have to figure out how do I get into?
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.180]   the ability to steward land some people don't like the word own and I I
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.940]   Don't have a problem with the word own, but I also were touched with the fact that I'm mortal
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.060]   I'm gonna die someday and then like whatever I did to that land. I'm not gonna control anymore
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:30.980]   So I see it as like I have a stewardship over a piece of property until the day they put a stone over my head
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:38.540]   So you get yourself into that piece of property and then you start looking at how am I gonna provide as much?
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:45.360]   Of what I need without reliance on others. So then you're looking at energy efficient construction
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:50.860]   My personal biggest limitation on my property today. Is it really financial?
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.420]   I could put fifty thousand dollars into a solar array for my house
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:45:00.820]   But it's stupid because the the house is not efficient enough to make it worth doing
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:07.700]   It really doesn't make it was a built in 1979. Do you know what interest rates were on a mortgage in 1979?
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.260]   Eight
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.260]   eighteen point nine percent
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.460]   Thank You Jimmy Carter eighteen point nine percent
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.980]   So if you have a house built in 78 79 80
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:27.280]   Every shortcut was taken at a time when we were working with 1979 technology, right?
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:33.220]   So this is not an energy efficient home and in putting that kind of money into a solar array here
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.980]   Doesn't make any sense. It's also a place with a
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:40.420]   rock slab a few inches under the ground so I can't really put a
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.980]   Surface contact home in though that would make sense
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.860]   So I have to work with what I have but if I was 18, I
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:51.380]   Mean, I would really be very tempted to look for land that I could buy
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:56.780]   For cash if I had to kill myself for a couple years to make the money and and do all the construction
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:03.740]   Myself from ground up and that way you're gonna know everything that can go wrong on your property
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.820]   You're not gonna have to call somebody if something breaks because you built it in the first place
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:13.140]   You know how to fix it and I would go as energy efficient as possible and as much of your own
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:18.780]   Energy creation as possible. I would look to grow as much of my own food as possible
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.580]   I would do that very very heavily weighted toward annuals in the first few years
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:31.300]   Until I could shift that over to perennial production of fruit and nuts and things like that. I would definitely develop skill sets around
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.420]   animal husbandry
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.420]   There's no ROI on
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:41.540]   Calories that's better than an animal that eats something you can't eat and turns it into high quality meat
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.580]   So that's pastured pork. That's pastured poultry. That's pastured cattle
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:51.400]   And if you start looking at this, how much does a family of two or three or four really need?
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.920]   We will this year
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:47:00.780]   We're building a tractor an 8x8 chicken tractor. We're gonna build two of those. We're gonna spend about
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.340]   100 bucks apiece on them
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.660]   will
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:09.460]   Kind of nurse through this new group of ducks and geese and we just won't worry about them for right now
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:14.300]   But then we're gonna run two groups of 40 chickens. So 80 chickens
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.900]   We'll have birds that you'd go out and if you bought these birds of this quality
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:24.420]   You'd be paying for them 20 to 25 dollars apiece. We'll have like six seven bucks in them in total cost
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:30.760]   Okay, that's 80 birds. That's more than a chicken a week just from that little activity alone
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:36.180]   That is is an incredibly high value product
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:40.300]   And then since you've create you've done this for yourself and you have this
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:44.660]   Attachment to the fact that that animal actually gave its life for you. It's not
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:50.100]   Breaded crap in a red and white bucket. Okay. It's an animal that you raised
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:55.300]   So you're going to say to yourself the only way I can honor this animals life is
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.460]   To use every single bit of it
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.780]   So like what we'll do we actually have a processor because I don't have a time to process myself
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:07.860]   I'll take these 80 birds down to the processor. I'll have 40 processed as whole birds and 40 parted out
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:14.720]   The first thing I'll do is I'll come home and I'll throw 40 chicken backs next hearts livers into a pot and I'll make seven
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.780]   Gallons of chicken stock. I'm done with chicken stock for the year. I mean, I'm good
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.140]   I'll can that and I'm good with chicken stock for the year
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.900]   We'll take the rest of it. We'll cryo back it will freeze it. We'll have
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:34.100]   Meals for the you know, probably we'll eat chicken two to three times a year off of that when you start saying things like okay
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:38.140]   This bird we cooked whole now. We're gonna go ahead and make soup out of that
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:42.500]   That's two meals. Maybe a little bit that's pulled off as tarantulas. That's three meals
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.540]   So also just that one little thing
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:48.060]   That's not that hard to do takes eight weeks to raise those birds, by the way
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:53.720]   Same birds the commercial people raise just raised in a humane way that actually makes them a lot more high quality
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.540]   Flavor and just nutrition. So then you say okay. Well, that's great
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.940]   So you're gonna meet you but that's not what I'm doing
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.860]   what I'm actually doing is taking those 80 birds on a dilapidated piece of land and
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:10.180]   I'm moving them on a daily basis over an eight-week period and I'm regenerating that piece of land
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:16.740]   Next year when we do that process again our feed costs on the next 80 birds will go down
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:23.740]   Because the birds from the first year that we had to feed heavily will have provided fertility and disturbance
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.060]   to improve the pasture for the next group of chickens and
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:29.380]   Then depending on our goals
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:35.740]   We can just create incredibly lush pasture with that or we could advance a forest behind that there leaves us in a perennial production
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:44.540]   If we space the trees, right we can move and pasture chickens right through more of a civil pasture manner with a forest around them
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.540]   Which in Texas is great because now they're shaded
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:52.100]   So they're gonna have a higher survivability rate and if you start looking at that then I can start doing my timings
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:57.260]   So over time what we grow trees like persimmons that grow very large and have mast
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:05.180]   Overhead that hold their mast and drop their fruit if you don't pick it yourself, they don't drop that fruit until like January
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.820]   so now I can run chickens in the winter when it's not hot and
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:12.660]   I can over graze them on a free yield a high caloric yield
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:19.940]   So I mean it's it's difficult for me to answer your question because all of that's just one element in this design
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:25.740]   I would say that the individual is gonna have to decide what's most important to them
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:29.960]   If you want to make a living on a quarter of an acre, I can show you how to do it
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.960]   It's called a backyard nursery
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:36.300]   Start growing plants learn to graft learn to start trees and bushes from seed
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:40.280]   Learn to clone learn to root learn how to do misting beds
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.120]   That alone could be an income unit that can provide an income for a family
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:49.520]   I know a family in New York that employs seven people
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:56.280]   On a four acre farm seven people full-time employees paid quite well for what they do. You know what they grow roses
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:03.500]   Right. So and people when I brought that up at permaculture voices last year people that blacks not permaculture. I want to grow food
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.500]   I'm like, well, they're growing organic roses
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.200]   They're charging a premium for them because of that
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:12.240]   Do you know how much pesticides nicotinicides all that stuff goes into?
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.480]   The production of things like a rose because no one cares because you don't eat it
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.400]   So here's people that are actually improving land, but they're just smart enough to grow a high-value product
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.160]   So when it comes to an income source off of a property you have to decide
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:30.760]   What it is that you want to focus on for income and I would also say you're gonna have to learn
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:36.360]   Basic business acumen and you're gonna have to learn how to do mathematical projections
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.360]   You're gonna have to increase your financial IQ
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:44.740]   You have to know what things like our poo are or average revenue per user in telecom or to make a generic unit
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:48.580]   so most people think of like if I have a business and I do
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:51.800]   10,000 units and I make
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:56.680]   $10 a unit I make a hundred thousand dollars minus my expenses great if I want to double that well
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.360]   I need to go and sell twice as many
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:58.860]   No
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.440]   You need to increase your average sale price
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:05.000]   That can be done by making the product more premium and being able to charge more for it
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   That can be done by figuring out other
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.960]   Adjunctive products that we can add on and stack on and bundle the way the telecom sector does with your phone and your cable and your
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:17.000]   You know all that stuff bundled together and you have so you have to learn that you have to learn
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.600]   The concepts that are to me
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:24.960]   I don't get how we have people coming out of college and I've never been and I understand this stuff and they don't
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.880]   Cogs cost of goods sold. What is it actually people say?
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.700]   Well, I make $20 a chicken doing pastured chickens
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:37.220]   No, you don't, you know, not unless space aliens beam your chicken to you all processed and ready to go
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:42.720]   And you still have a marketing expense. What is what is that bird eat? What does it eat?
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:49.040]   I don't know anybody that's gotten to a level yet where their birds are a hundred percent pastured their feet
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.040]   So what's the cost of feed?
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:58.480]   What is the cost in energy to get food and water to them? What what are what are you spending in labor hours?
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.520]   Maintaining those animals if you've built things like tractors, okay
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.160]   Which a tractor for those that may I realize now I'm on a financial show
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:13.280]   So my own attractors basically a large movable pen that lets the chickens have access to the ground so we can control their movements
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:18.660]   Well, what did that cost until that things paid back? It's an expense against every bird you sell
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:26.120]   so you to design your lifestyle you have to learn to think like a business person and I think if there's
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:30.460]   Anything we are totally screwing our young people with today
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:38.080]   It's that our universities and our government schools are so dedicated to brainwashing them to the gloriousness of
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.680]   socialism and
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:43.600]   And I'm as politically agnostic as it gets I'm an anarchist
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.680]   So it's not like I'm preaching Republican here for somebody that might think so
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:53.400]   But but our schools are dedicated to teaching our children that socialism is good to the extent that they have
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.680]   villainized words like profit and
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:02.960]   That means that a child or a young adult cannot come out of either high school or university and have any
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.560]   understanding any fundamental understanding whatsoever of economics
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:12.760]   They can't comprehend economics because to comprehend economics
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:17.680]   The first thing you have to say is how do I ensure that the effort that put is put here is?
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:22.960]   Actually worth doing and we define that with profit if profit becomes a cuss word
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:28.920]   How the hell is a person gonna understand economics and I hear all these young people around permaculture
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:32.720]   You know what? They say to me Josh. I want to start a company. I want it to be a nonprofit
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:41.280]   Okay, and this is I have to give credit to Mark Shepard for this but if you have a nonprofit
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:48.120]   Without a profitable entity attached to it first. You are a professional beggar, right?
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:52.000]   That's all that you are. The nonprofit is a is a tax
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:57.820]   Vehicle so that when you become really successful and have surplus income and you want to do good things
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.040]   You go out and create a nonprofit. You never call it yours
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.680]   You put an independent board of directors in place and you take your excess evil profits
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.920]   You put them in a nonprofit and you get to decide where that money goes
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:14.120]   Instead of letting somebody in Washington decide where it goes for you. You'll never hear that in school
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:18.940]   Either you know university or high school business courses, whatever
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:23.960]   So that person can't design the life that way because they don't have the knowledge
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:29.660]   If I ask you, how do you get a nail into a piece of a wood? What you'd say a hammer, okay?
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.360]   But if you didn't know a hammer existed
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:37.680]   I need some sort of heavy use common sense some sort of heavy blunt instrument to bang it in and
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.880]   If I showed you a hammer, even if you'd never seen one before and you looked at a nail you go
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.740]   Oh, I don't work. What we've done is we've so
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:49.400]   Educated our children that when you show them a hammer in a nail
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:56.960]   They can't make the connection anymore because someone told them the hammer was bad because it's mean it's mean to the poor little nail
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:59.720]   It creates a microaggression
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:03.660]   Seriously, here's a microaggression the nail didn't want to be in that piece of oak
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:10.780]   And by the way, some evil bastard cut down the oak tree and made it into a piece of wood. I mean, so
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:16.600]   when I get in the permaculture with young people I have to give them a little bit of that brain shock because
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.840]   Like I don't want to cut a tree down. What are you gonna live it?
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.240]   Right. What you need to do is make sure for every tree you cut down
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.360]   You've done enough to make sure three grow back
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:31.000]   That that's the way you you handle resource management here
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.960]   And you you start figuring things out like so another need that we would have if I have a homestead
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.400]   I'm putting in I need fuel wood. So let's learn efficiency
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:45.360]   So let's design something like a rocket stove. So we're gonna do a lot of our cooking on a rocket stove
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.960]   We can take little handfuls of wood and we can cook full meals on them
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.520]   So now let's go out and plant a tree like black locust. So we plant black locust
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.840]   We give it about four or five years
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:59.460]   It gets up till it's about you know, eight nine feet high and we go and we just we're evil
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:03.120]   We get a chainsaw out burn fossil fuels and cut it right off at chest height
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:07.520]   Cut all that up into a bunch of little pieces, you know, what happens it grows back
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.720]   It grows back incredibly rapidly
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:17.520]   We can start cutting that tree for that type of use in five to six year rotations and never actually kill a tree again
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:23.280]   Provide all the fuel and heat for our house that we would ever need in a northern climate where I'm using more of a conventional
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:29.520]   Wood burning wood burning heat. I might be doing my rotations in 10 or 12 years, but I can use the same tree
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.520]   just applied differently, so
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.280]   When you want me to say how a person should design their life
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.200]   What you're asking me to do is come in and paint your picture for you
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:45.520]   And what I what I really prefer to do is say you have the canvas, you know
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:53.320]   You you have the the the paint you have the brushes you have the knives. Let me show you how they work and
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:56.080]   Then you paint your picture
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.600]   the way that you want your life to be and
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.920]   It has to be that way
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:07.800]   I mean my last tenant in my modern survival philosophy is my plan cannot and will not work for you
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:12.000]   What you do matters and you have to make these decisions for yourself
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.180]   All that I do is provide you the knowledge to build life the way that you want it
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:23.120]   Because what happens is if I say do these 20 things whether it's preparedness or permaculture or lifestyle design
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.120]   You'll follow it right up to the first one that you don't agree with and then you'll fall out. You won't do anything else
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.320]   But if I say here's all the knowledge that you need
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:36.120]   Here's the way to think about this and I guess that's the biggest thing is to learn systems thinking
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:42.440]   To start realizing that every single thing you do whether it's on a property or in your life or in an educational
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:45.080]   Program is connected to every other single piece of it
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:52.320]   And whenever you do something make sure you're stacking its functionality to do multiple things and make sure you're putting it in the right
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.080]   relative location and
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:59:01.760]   Then I guess the biggest thing that our young people work so hard for but yet are so frivolous with is
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:07.280]   Social capital. I think it the most valuable thing that you can build today is social capital
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.280]   That's why I call it social networking, right?
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.480]   Tweeting and Pinteresting and Facebooking all that stuff
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:20.320]   And if you think about what the entire life of a teenager or a young adult is around being popular going to the right part
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.560]   It's all about social capital, but it's worthless social capital
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:27.560]   How many people that you wanted to like you in high school?
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:33.960]   Whether they did or not where it was important and you made an effort for it Josh. Do you even know today?
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.960]   Do you even know where they are?
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.160]   Yeah, right. So we
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:43.320]   Say I all those people that somehow seemed important at this point
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.840]   I think I have two or three friends from high school and that's it
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:53.720]   See and you but you spend so much time and people worry about what clothes do I buy on what shoes do I wear?
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.680]   I also at least he didn't in the 80s when I was in school, right?
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.880]   That was how you were popular. You looked right you dressed right?
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:06.280]   You talked right all this ever in a social capital with no understanding at ever at all what social capital really is. I had a
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.840]   Not really a friend. He was an old man. That was a friend of my grandfather's
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.560]   Lived up the road from us. His name was buddy shoemaker in Jonestown, Pennsylvania
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.520]   buddy made wine
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:24.460]   Homemade wine really good wine. I didn't understand the word social capital at the time, but looking back
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:30.200]   I recognized it for what it was this guy could call a favor in anywhere. This was buddies deal
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.260]   You grow grapes you grow raspberries, whatever you pick it you put in buckets you bring it to the buddies house
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:39.800]   He writes your name on the bucket you go away when your wines ready. He calls you
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.600]   He takes half of the stuff that he made wine and gives it to you. He keeps the other half
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.320]   That was it. That was his whole deal
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.240]   And if he need if he needed something he usually didn't pay cash
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:56.240]   You want parsley wine you want raspberry wine? You want some real sake?
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.000]   What do you want and he would barter for this stuff?
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.920]   And if he needed a favor throw a couple bottles of you know, Andrew Andrew Spirko
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:10.160]   My my my grandfather Biff's conquer grape wine at you or whatever it was and he could get anything done
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.080]   and
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:18.680]   He was a value to the community and there were a whole bunch of people that lived there that kind of knew how to
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.560]   Making wines not that hard
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.640]   I make wines and meads and beers now and I love doing it
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:29.040]   But there were a lot of people that went that's that's that's his thing. I just like it's fall
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.680]   I'm gonna have a harvest I take it to buddy now
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.360]   I can go deer hunting put meat in the freezer for my family and I know by mid spring
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.040]   I'll have a few gallons of wine to last throughout the year
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.360]   That's social capital and it's social capital on steroids
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:50.280]   If this guy had wanted to be the mayor of the the little town that was a little bit bigger
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:54.280]   That was the actual thing that owned us which was minersville. Guess what people do there, right?
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:02:00.680]   This guy could have been the mayor like that, right? He don't want anything to do with it. So we're not teaching people about
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:07.120]   Is Ethan Rowland calls them the eight forms of capital and the chief one being social capital though a little bit more?
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:12.020]   Awareness of that is happening just because you see somebody that because of their online presence can
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:19.760]   Sell a lot of product or whatever financial capital is the one that everybody thinks of but there's other forms of capital
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.960]   There's experiential capital. What do you know?
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:30.080]   And experiential capital links in a social capital because what you don't know who do you know that knows and if you have a good network
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.880]   The networks experience becomes your own
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:41.080]   Cultural capital is what's the value of the pure culture of what you're involved with if you build a really cool homestead?
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.280]   Guess what people will pay to come work for you
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.680]   I know it sounds nuts
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.720]   But people I have a thing going this this this Saturday and people are gonna pay me
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.760]   $15 to come here and work for a day and we'll sell out
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.560]   Okay
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.660]   We'll get a whole bunch of work done and I'm not taking advantage of because we feed them really good and stuff like that
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:05.680]   But that's because we've built a culture around what we're doing at nine mile farm in the survival podcast
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:11.480]   Living capital I talked about planting trees on your property living capital is when I have a tree
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:16.240]   I have I've taken an appreciating asset and I've taken it off of the tax doll
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:21.840]   I put a tree and I pay 20 bucks for if you had a tree on your property
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.520]   There was an apple tree that's 15 years old
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.920]   huge dropping hundreds and hundreds of pounds of apples every year and somebody walked up to you and said
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:34.540]   I'll give you 200 bucks if I can cut that tree down and take it away
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:44.260]   You tell him to piss off right that trees it's gone 20 30 fold over what you paid for it, but it's not taxed
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:50.560]   That's a form of living capital back this cultural capital for a second. Why do people want to work for Google?
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:55.560]   It's not just financial capital. There's good paying jobs that you can have if you qualify to work for Google
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.980]   Somebody else would pay you. Well, it's the culture there
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.260]   intellectual capital is
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:10.380]   Beyond experience it's more total knowledge or it could be traditional intellectual capital like a patent or something like that or a trademarked brand
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.200]   spiritual capital it is an
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.020]   You can't really put a number on it
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:22.780]   but there's a certain value into being at peace with who you are and what your place is in the world and if you start
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.480]   Blending all these forms of capital together
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:31.800]   I mean this should be a required course in high school if we're gonna have schools that the children are forced to go to
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:40.220]   Children should be taught about these forms of capital so that they can learn how to actually work with each other rather than constantly
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.500]   tearing each other apart
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:49.100]   The reason people tear each other apart and fight for a pecking order in these social systems and behave more like primates than human beings
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:53.500]   Is because they're so limited in their knowledge of the value that other people have
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:59.540]   It could be summed up. It was something like what was the saying be careful of the toes you step on today?
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:04.580]   They may be connected to the ass you have to kiss tomorrow and and that's I mean
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:10.380]   Kids don't get this like the guy you're picking on at school today that you're calling a nerd is probably gonna be worth a fortune
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.620]   in the future and
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:17.180]   If we actually started to see each other for the value that we have a lot of these problems that we have would go away
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:22.340]   So I don't know if that's really an answer to the question, but I mean that's where it leads to for me
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:24.340]   It's a great survey of the topics and I would encourage
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:29.860]   listeners who are interested in deep more of a deep dive to go out and just look through the archives of your of your show
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.380]   to see
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:36.140]   To see episodes that interest them and that's what I that's one of the things I appreciate the most about you Jack
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:36.940]   I don't
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.340]   With doing my own podcast
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:43.100]   I don't listen nearly as much as I used to when I had when I made more time to listen to audio
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:46.980]   but I've always appreciated your your creative creative thinking and
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:50.940]   The whole idea of understanding different forms of capital
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.900]   I mean that was the basic is one of the basic ethics of the US American culture, you know
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:59.820]   The whole idea of let's make a deal. What do you got that I want? And what do I got that you want?
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:03.100]   unfortunately, many people have lost the
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:08.420]   Ability to think in that way and I'll just give a couple of modern practical examples
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:12.980]   I mean you talk about your friend with with the wine. I know people who do that all the time
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:17.340]   I know somebody who does that with honey. He's got a few hives of honey. He makes some great honey
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.980]   He does all kinds of deals on Craigslist in jars of honey
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:26.540]   I know you think about even in a business you can sometimes offer things
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:30.620]   I've bartered all kinds of things to get radical personal finance off the ground when cash flow
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:35.780]   When cash inflow is tight you barter what you have that's the end and it forces you to be creative
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:40.180]   But you could take a job that you might generally need to pay $15 an hour
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:45.540]   but if you can just adjust the deal that you're offering a little bit and allow somebody to do it on a
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.140]   flexible
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:52.460]   Schedule or allow somebody to do it from an off-site location from their from their kitchen computer instead of
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:57.220]   Instead of there in your office all of a sudden if that works in your business structure
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:03.460]   You can lower your costs and you can create a barter deal out of all kinds of flexible things
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:04.900]   It doesn't just have to be apples and honey
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:10.800]   It's a matter of looking creatively at what we have and seeing what is this other person want and value?
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.800]   So we can go away with a win-win deal
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:18.380]   Definitely and I think one of the big differences between barter and
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:26.940]   Financial transactions and I'm gonna say this when I want to clarify this you can have a transaction that involves
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:35.100]   Capital in the form of cash or money that's barter and you can have just a straight financial transaction
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:40.700]   for example if you are forced to buy insurance that you don't want and
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:45.440]   If you don't do it, there'll be some sort of a penalty
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:52.820]   It is a purely financial transaction if you're buying something solely because you have to have it because it's a need it's purely
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:58.500]   Financial and in a lot of financial transactions. It's is a tendency that
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:07.060]   Either the person that spent the money feels victimized or they were lulled into the false belief that they won
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:14.060]   Right, like I showed them I got that car for next to nothing. No, you did they made all the money on the financing
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:17.940]   The this is this is the the psychology of money in America today
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:23.820]   The first thing a person if I say rich and we play word association, I say a word you say a response to it
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:29.940]   Not you probably not your listeners, but the majority of Americans if I say rich they say greedy or something like that
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.900]   We've been so warped to believe that when you move to a barter mentality
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:40.820]   The only way a transaction ever happens is that both sides feel they want
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:49.820]   That you have you wouldn't do it and many times you see people bartering stuff that they would have actually been happy to give away
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:53.220]   but the reciprocant says I
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:57.700]   Feel that since you're willing to give me something of value
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:01.180]   I should be willing to give you something of value in exchange
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:05.140]   and if you don't want it pass it on to somebody that does and
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:13.180]   One of the biggest pieces of my modern education going is if I call my modern education since I started becoming a teacher I
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:18.220]   Had a friend named Ron hood. That was an icon in the survival industry
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:22.580]   he actually owns the domain survival calm to tell you how long ago he got in the game and
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:29.700]   He was like a brother. I never knew the day that I met him and we both had pretty big egos
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.700]   I was getting started out but a little bit of stardom
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:37.420]   Stardom ego going and he had like that establishment ego and he also had this kind of attitude that people in this industry
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:43.220]   When they approached him were looking to get something from him and we met and I could tell he was worried about that
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.820]   it took about two seconds for both of us to drop shields and be brothers and
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.740]   We had an incredible
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:53.620]   Friendship for about two years until unfortunately he passed away
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:59.540]   And I only ever actually got to see him in real life face to face and shake hands and break bread with him about three
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:03.180]   times but we talked on the phone and by Skype almost weekly and
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:08.420]   in one of the events that he ran that I went to I learned about a thing called the barter blanket and
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:11.020]   This is where you lay down a blanket
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:16.900]   Somebody steps forward lays down an item for barter and then anybody else that's watching can lay down an exchange item
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.300]   You have to sell it a little bit
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:23.100]   Why would you want it that type of thing you have ten people offer ten different things against the one and the guy that laid?
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.700]   down the first one
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:28.100]   Decides I'll take this deal or I don't want any of it or
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:32.580]   how about I split it in half and I get this in this, you know, just basic barter and
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:38.220]   When I started doing my training events here at my farm, I thought you know
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.640]   What a great way to honor his memory but to tell his story
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:46.140]   Break out a bottle of this crappy gin and he loved that sapphire blue crap
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.220]   And I keep a bottle here
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:52.220]   And if anybody ever comes to this house the new Ron you drink a shot of that whether you want it or not
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:57.580]   and I pass that bottle of gin around I tell Ron's story and we start our barter and
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:00.300]   You see people
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:06.780]   Barter like especially newbies that have never been before barter like they're going to the store at first. It's what I can I get?
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.780]   what can I get I get and
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:11.660]   Then you start to see generosity flow
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:18.460]   And you start to see people do things like oh, I have a vacation home, you know on the beach in, California
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:21.060]   They usually rents out for two thousand dollars a day
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:26.780]   That's an actual item that's been put on my barter blanket and you see a whole bunch of people sit around and go. Yeah
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:29.580]   Too rich for my blood and the person go
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:32.660]   What do you got?
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.820]   What do you got I didn't set a price on it
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:44.820]   What do you got and you see somebody trade something that maybe has a value of 200 bucks for four thousand dollars worth of time
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:50.420]   In a vacation home. Well the person that owns that home knows there's gonna the stipulation is you got to pick a day
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.580]   I don't have it rented
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:56.180]   So is he's gonna sit there empty anyway, but they've thrown that out kind of as a generosity
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:00.740]   I've done things where I'll say I'm gonna give away five hours of my time consulting
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:05.300]   and as you might imagine I'm pretty stingy with my consulting time anymore and
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:09.600]   I'll have two or three people throw down something and I'll go, okay
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:16.580]   Everybody pick up your items. I don't want your items. I'm gonna do it for all three of you because you took a shot and
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:25.300]   This is what happens when you move in the barter because you start to realize that there's there's more important things than what we initially
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:29.780]   get from something building relationships knowing we can come back and
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:36.740]   I actually think that you start gravitating more toward what Toby Hemingway describes as a gift based economy
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.540]   And I don't mean gift schemes
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:43.460]   But in permaculture city he talks about the barter that never was like we're told before there was money
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:50.260]   Everything was bartered but in in a village, let's say where I was the knife maker and your son needed a knife
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:53.100]   Well, I'm the knife maker
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:58.820]   So you'd come to me get a knife. Well, that's what I do. I make knives. So when you need a knife here, I
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:04.380]   Don't have anything to give you right now. Okay here. I got like 20 of them sitting here on the table
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.300]   I make knives. That's what I do. I don't have anything else to do
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:14.940]   Here and when I needed something it was just there now people start to look at that as like socialism or communism
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:21.540]   But those those orders of human interaction were prior to the advent of the state
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.540]   These were hunter-gatherer
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:27.780]   societies that had kind of formed a little bit of stability into a village and they were always
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:31.900]   Limited in headcount to about a hundred to two hundred people and it would have to then break off
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:36.500]   It would get too big. It would start to become a bureaucracy even without a bureaucracy and
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:40.740]   I don't I'm not fanciful. I don't think we can go back to living like that
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:48.020]   but I'm also as a modernist a believer that we take the very best of everything that we can assemble together and
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:52.340]   We put that together kind of Bruce Lee like right we absorb what is useful
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:58.220]   we reject what is useless and we add what is uniquely our own and that we can be building these types of
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:04.900]   individual communities all over the country both geographically based on real interactions and
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:07.900]   virtually based on online interactions
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:15.020]   We can start to develop our own our own our own economies our own forms of money our own systems of value exchange
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:21.780]   Bitcoin taught me something money's bullshit money is a fabrication out of thin air
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:29.540]   It's an agreement between people to assign a value of energy to an inanimate object. That's really worthless, right? It's a system of accounting
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:35.060]   When you come to me and say I want to buy your old iPhone and I say 200 bucks
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.860]   You give me some paper with some numbers on it
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.780]   I give you the iPhone and the transaction ends
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:47.300]   The only purpose the paper serves is an accounting because now I have the $200 you have your iPhone
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.300]   You can go reprogram it do whatever you want
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.540]   But I need something of value that I can go prove
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:57.140]   To the next party in exchange that I have actually my value came from something
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:04.260]   right and that's all Bitcoin is Bitcoin just keeps an accounting of who exchanged what and puts a value on it and
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:10.740]   It's our confidence in that value that actually allows it to propagate and people look at the American dollar and go
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:16.700]   It's all based on debt. It has to collapse. Why doesn't it because the confidence is there because people believe that it has value
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:23.620]   Therefore they're willing to exchange it and if we can just continue to evolve away from that
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:30.140]   And I'm not saying I want to get rid of money tomorrow morning, right because I earn a living mostly in Federal Reserve notes
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:36.060]   Quite on I'll take Bitcoin. I'll take silver, but most of my incomes in money and most of my purchases are in money
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:39.460]   But wherever I get the opportunity to exchange
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:44.060]   Non-monetary barter, I'll do it and I'll do it every single time
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:50.500]   Jack I got one final question for you you throw out so many great ideas and
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:54.460]   The challenge often with great ideas
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:16:01.120]   Ideas are maybe some ideas have ideas have potential value, but frankly there are a ton of great ideas
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:06.180]   everything the real value of an idea is in the execution and the implementation and
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:13.980]   I think that's where a lot of people break down. I'm amazed at the business that you run. Not only do you run your podcast with
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:17.060]   remarkable frequency and and depth
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:23.420]   but you also have your hand in a number of other businesses as a consultant advisor business partner and you still
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:28.380]   make the time to get out on your own property and sweat and build your
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:31.100]   Garden the way that you desire it to be
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:38.300]   How what's your personal time management system? And how do you get everything done that you want to get done?
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:48.140]   Well, so it's something I struggle with every day but my basics are this I have living creatures on my property
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:52.820]   If I don't take care of them, they'll die. So when I get up in the morning doesn't matter what else I got to do
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:57.620]   I do that first. I make sure everybody's gonna live through the day then I come in and I do my show
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:06.300]   I that takes precedence over everything else over guest interviews over consultation calls over any of my peripheral businesses
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:12.780]   Anything like that the show must go on in the old adage so that gets done when that's done
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:16.720]   Then I take a look at do I need to do any marketing for the show?
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.140]   Are there any commitments that I've made?
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:22.180]   Do I have any accounting to take care of stuff like that that gets done if I'm free at that point?
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:24.180]   I get out and work the land
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:28.700]   Otherwise, it's you know, maybe I have a conference call with a partner in a different business or something like that
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.500]   But the way I've made this work is a couple things
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:35.140]   Number one. I've started saying no to a whole lot of stuff
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:39.700]   I have people coming at me all the time want to do something with me. I'm like you go do something
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:45.860]   You go do it. You don't need me you think you do and you think because I touch it. It's gonna turn to gold
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.540]   Trust me. I've had failures too. You go do your own thing
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:54.300]   Stop telling me what you're gonna do and go show me what you're doing. All right, so I started saying no to a lot of things
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:18:00.540]   The other thing I've done is when I do get involved with partners in a business like we have a business right now
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:05.900]   We're working on to develop a new type of caging so that suburban eyes can raise quail for meat and eggs
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.920]   I think it'd be a great thing to put that love because you can't love what I said about the chicken tractor
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.980]   You're not doing that on Maple Street, right?
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:19.980]   So we want to do that with quail for people much easier to process higher value nutrition higher value product that you put out
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:23.580]   If you want to sell it, but this is what I told my partners in that business. I
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:30.020]   Will see to making sure that people know about it. I will market it through my platform
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:35.180]   I will test bed it right here because I have quail and I'll make sure that we find all the things that are wrong with
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:37.620]   It because I'll just use it you make me prototypes
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:40.840]   I'll use it and tell you everything screwed up and we won't release it till it works, right?
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:47.340]   Everything else is on your plate. You guys have to worry about accounting. You guys have to worry about tax reporting
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:49.340]   You guys have to worry about inventory
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:55.260]   If there's some financial investment, I'm willing to put some of that in the game, but overall it's on you
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:19:00.940]   You don't want that deal can't work with you because I don't have any more time and that seems very
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:03.740]   kind of hard-lined hard-nosed and
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:08.620]   I'll you know part of what got me in trouble in the past and I over extended myself as I always want to say yes
[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:13.500]   I always want to help people but I also realized a lot of times when you think you're helping people what you're doing is what?
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.180]   I call trying to breathe for them
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:22.380]   right, you're trying to make somebody successful a person that's going to be successful will be successful without my help a
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:27.540]   Person that's not going to be successful still will not be successful with my help
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:31.620]   All I can do is inspire and you talked about throwing out all these great ideas
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:34.820]   I have people all the time say shit. I want to tell you about my idea
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:40.060]   But we just signed a non-disclosure agreement get the out of here. I'm sorry go get get get out of here
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.700]   The dogs looking at me like I'm yelling at him right like
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:50.220]   Because because I don't have I don't even have time to talk to you now if you think I have time to steal your idea
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:56.220]   Which probably 20 people are other already doing you're out of your mind. I just let my ideas go
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:00.460]   Because I know that I come up with some stuff
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:08.320]   that could really be good for people and could really be good for both the customer and the producer and that I am
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:12.540]   Absolutely not going to be able to get it all done. I'm not going to be able to control everything
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.260]   I'm not even going to be able to be a part of everything that I can come up with
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:21.660]   So I'll just throw it out there and I figure if I throw something out to 150,000 people one person might go you know
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.460]   that could work if
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:29.980]   That's when I think you're going to be successful when you can you take my idea and the first thing you say is yeah
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:31.620]   It's not really whole yet
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:36.220]   It needs this this and this because that's what I do when I do decide to ferret out an idea
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.300]   I come up with like I was gonna be great
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:42.340]   I map it all out and write up a proposal even if there's nobody to give it to just so I can look at it make
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.900]   Sure, it makes sense, and I start working through it and go that's wrong
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:50.300]   That's wrong that needs an adjustment. Oh gee if you do that with a quail. They break their eggs
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.300]   That's you find that out when you get a broken egg, okay?
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:56.260]   So you're always going to have like an idea is never
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:00.540]   Complete when it's first birthed it has to be massaged
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:05.180]   And I feel if I can put out you know over the next ten years a thousand ideas and
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:09.180]   250 of them become businesses support families that the
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:15.060]   The the ego that I don't want to give this stuff away because someday
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.820]   I'll get to it is inherently selfish, and it's also just
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:20.940]   inherently misguided
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.700]   I mean we get 24 hours a day
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:30.300]   And I feel that I do a better job of making the most of those hours than most people do because it's hardwired into my
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:35.580]   Genetics I think my you know I said my dad was a coal miner, but he was a coal miner
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:38.180]   He ran you know for years. He ran his own tire shop
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:44.300]   He he today. He's doing pallets the guy you know doesn't really have to work anymore
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.940]   But he's out busting his ass rebuilding and selling pallets
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:54.500]   Manual labor, and he's you know in his late 60s. Why because he doesn't know anything else
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.460]   He doesn't know anything, but work
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:02.100]   And I you know I come from a family that has it we're out of the Ukraine and we're just hard-working people
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.740]   And and I love
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:11.460]   Work when it's something that I actually see that I'm producing value in so when I do my podcast
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:15.540]   And I get an email from somebody says hey because you we started this little soap business
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:20.820]   Here's a couple bars of soap. I'm like that's cool, and I want to hear from him a year later and go yeah
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:25.820]   We did a forty five thousand dollars of soap last year my wife's quitting her job now, then I'm like hell
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:29.980]   Yeah, and I'm thinking I would never build a business on soap
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:35.020]   So that's why I don't want people bringing me like they're like do you think this is a good idea don't ask me
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:40.100]   I've been wrong a lot man remember Power Rangers when that came out. I thought it was a billion-dollar blunder
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:43.900]   I if I was a TV executive I would have screwed up like kids aren't gonna watch this
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:50.060]   I mean, I don't know everything so my time management is I focus on first
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:55.460]   What needs to be done, and then second what I want to do and then I don't have time
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:58.540]   After that you know
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:01.240]   You know we have this little duck business
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:07.380]   We produce these eggs, and you know that makes us about I think our gross billing on that's about eleven hundred twelve hundred dollars a month
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:14.560]   After two after the expenses it pretty much pays the the base of our mortgage not our you know interest in well
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:19.000]   It's like a principal and interest what it doesn't pay is our our tax and our PMI and all that crap
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.800]   But we're not doing it for that
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:27.820]   I could take the same time we put into these ducks and put together one marketing program for the podcast a month to sell something
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.820]   and make more money, but
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:35.880]   My ducks keep me sane. You know I work with co-workers that sing all day and don't talk bad about each other now
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:42.380]   They maintain my land I bought a tractor the only thing I've used it for for two years is the little card on the back
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:47.780]   To haul stuff around I don't have to cut weeds. I don't to cut grass. I don't have to provide fertility so
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:55.700]   That time while not financially the most profitable. I guess what I'm saying is I've built a lifestyle business
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.740]   It's not just about the income. It's about the lifestyle
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:04.220]   There's there's nothing that I want to do that I can't do and
[01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:10.540]   The things that I have to do are things that I don't mind doing and I think that's that's when you when people start looking
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:13.220]   At you go. Holy crap. How do you get so much done?
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:18.660]   Well if you want to do it, and you're able to just get rid of things that you don't want to do
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:20.660]   It's amazing how productive you become
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:27.060]   Jack thanks so much for coming on the show. I really appreciate it the survival podcast calm your show is listed in iTunes
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:29.460]   I knew the websites that you'd like to share with the audience
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:35.780]   Yeah, I mean the best website is as you said the survival podcast calm and there's a shortcut to that
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:38.180]   You can just go to T SPC coach
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:41.900]   T SPC dot co don't put an M on the end of it
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:45.700]   It's an actual domain just CEO and that'll link you there when you get there
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:52.100]   You can find pretty much everything else. I'm doing you can link over to permit ethos, which is our permaculture initiative
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:54.900]   We're doing some really great things with education there
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:59.420]   We have a really exciting group now on Facebook called the regenerative agriculture group
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:04.940]   It's like permaculture, but I don't have to explain to somebody that's never heard the word what that means and we have a group there of doers
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:08.780]   It's all people that are working to get stuff done in their own backyard
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:15.380]   Lots of entrepreneurial stuff on that from raising broiler chickens to micro greens to you name it
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:19.180]   I really recommend people check out the regenerative agriculture group
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:22.660]   And everything else we're doing we have like sub communities
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:25.860]   I have a forum that I don't even post too much hardly anymore
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:30.500]   That's run by my moderator team of about 25 guys and gals really great people
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:35.820]   We have a Zello channel Zello is like ham radio without a ham radio
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:38.460]   it's you turn your smartphone or your computer into like a
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:44.580]   Push-button radio and we there's like chat groups on it and we have the most the largest
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:48.900]   group and most active group on the whole Zello Network the
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:56.260]   Zello board of directors have actually met with the people on my group to discuss making Zello a better platform because of the most
[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:59.020]   Heavy user group on the whole network
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:01.620]   Incredible people that look after each other
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:06.460]   leverage technology to do we've had women that had to travel across the country by themselves and
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:11.500]   They'll put a little app on their phone and the whole Zello group can see where they're at travel along the way
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:16.540]   Keep in touch with them. Somebody's always on the network making sure that if anything goes wrong with somebody's there to help them
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:19.940]   I mean stuff like that when I start thinking about that and going well
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:22.740]   All that was was a thing that I set up and let other people take over
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:30.500]   That's what this stuff's all about. So the survival podcast calm is a place to go. I do have a business podcast
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.940]   I did like 130 episodes and then just went
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:40.380]   Until somebody does every single thing in that podcast with their business and need something else. It's intellectual masturbation
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:44.820]   So until that happens till somebody brings me their business and goes I've done everything you said
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.660]   I do and I'm at a sticking point that's on permanent hiatus
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.580]   I ran out of time to do it
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:53.060]   But if you want to build a business, especially online Jack Spiegel calm will tell you how to do it
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:57.740]   I can always be reached through my email Jack at the survival podcast calm
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:00.340]   if you actually want to see me to see your email put
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:07.100]   TSP see in the subject line and that goes into a special folder that gets kind of priority for a review. Awesome
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.100]   Thanks for coming on
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:11.780]   Hey, man, I'm happy to do it
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.780]   There probably enough ideas in that
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:18.860]   Interview that you might want to go back and listen to it again and just find a couple
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:23.940]   I mean my favorite and I've heard Jack talk about it before I try not to steal his stuff, but my favorite is
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:26.900]   avoiding taxation by planting trees
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:32.860]   Or other gardening associated things I've wanted to do a long time
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:36.860]   I've talked about in the past the concept of turning your house from a house into a homestead, but
