[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Radical Personal Finance, episode 36.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   I thank you for being here with us.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Today is Wednesday, August 6, 2014.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And today's show is going to be all about tax planning.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   We're going to continue our tax planning series.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And today we're going to mainly talk about the three strategies for tax planning.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Timing, income shifting and conversion.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   With a special focus on timing.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I hope you enjoy.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I don't know whether it thrills you with excitement,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   or blows your heart with excitement to think about doing a show on tax planning like it does mine.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   But this is going to be fun.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   We're going to dig into some meat and potatoes of financial planning.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And I don't want the show to go off the rails into all philosophy or all politics or all economics, things like that.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I want to balance this with a lot of meat and potatoes financial planning topics.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And I think this is very, very important.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And I want to share just a couple minutes as far as why this topic,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   why I hope this topic will be of interest and of value to you.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And then we're going to dig into some meat and potato stuff.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And I promise I'm going to make it fun.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I'm going to make it interesting.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And I'm going to make it understandable.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We're going to be working with the highly theoretical today.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   We're going to be working with the highly theoretical.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   But I believe this information is intensely practical once you understand it.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So I'm going to share that with you.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   The last couple show topics have been, again, a variety.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   We've talked about politics.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   We've talked about economics.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I've talked about current events.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I've talked about everything from welfare to philosophy to getting rid of your TV to dumpster diving.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And what I really want to do today is I don't want to stay in that world.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I think it's fun and it's important to go into that world.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But today I want to dive deep into meat and potatoes financial planning,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and I want to give you a framework that you can use to apply to your life, especially as regards tax planning.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And I think you'll enjoy it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Now, any time it comes to financial planning, I've never heard somebody give some of this framework in a book.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I've never read it in books as far as reading it in personal finance books.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I haven't found it at Barnes & Noble.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Most of this information, the best I've been able to find it, comes from college accounting textbooks and things like that.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   That's where this is laid out.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And so before you roll your eyes back and say, "I don't want to study a college planning textbook," let me explain why this is so valuable.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   It's helpful to have a framework.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And the example that I thought of to try to convey this is the example of a car mechanic.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   There's probably two ways to learn to be a car mechanic, and both of them I think are valid and important.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So the first way would be learn how to bolt and unbolt certain parts.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   That's my level of expertise with car mechanics.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I don't really understand how the cars work.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I don't understand how the various components work.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I do try from time to time to unbolt and bolt certain things on, and I have pictures, and I pull out a manual, and it gives me pictures, and I say, "Bolt this part here.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Unbolt this part."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I know how to turn a wrench, and if the bolting and the unbolting works, then, okay, great, it worked.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   But I don't understand how the systems work.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I don't understand how the ignition system interplays with the fuel system.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I don't understand that.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   So if I go to turn the key and the car clicks, I don't know what that might mean.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   But someone who is an advanced car mechanic can understand what that means.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Now, how did they become an advanced car mechanic?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Well, they may have started with bolting and unbolting things, or they may also have started with learning the theory behind how the car works.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I think both are valid, and probably what is the most effective approach is to get in, roll your sleeves up, and start bolting and unbolting things.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And then also to learn a little bit about the theory.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So let's bring it over to financial planning.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Most financial planning radio shows or books that you read, frankly, in the personal finance space are very much, "Here's how you bolt and unbolt.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Here's how you turn a wrench."
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And that's valuable.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   That is really valuable.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   If somebody needs some instruction on you need to establish an IRA, and this will help you to establish an IRA,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   and that may be the very basic that someone can start with, or here's where you need to study it, here's how a budget process may work,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and here's how you can use that budgeting process to enhance your life so that you have more money.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Now, if it's all practical, however, we quickly run into a problem, and we run into this problem.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Let's say that the book says establish an IRA, but you read another book, and this other book says you should establish a Roth IRA.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Now you have two books, both of whom are written by learned, caring people, and they have differing recommendations.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   One says IRA.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   One says Roth IRA.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   How do you decide which one of them is right?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Well, in order to do that, you need a little bit of theory.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   You need a little bit of a framework, and so you need to understand what the advantages and disadvantages are of either of them,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   and they work differently.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   They have different components, and so it's not smart just to say, "Well, I'll split the difference and do half and half
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and hope that I'm half right and half wrong."
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   We need the framework.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   If you don't have the framework to understand what's going on, then you can't really make a rational decision between those two things,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and basically what you're then doing is you find yourself following the personality of the person that you like the most,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   and then we get into a debate, and we say, "Well, my favorite personality says this, and my favorite personality says that,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   so therefore this is what I'm going to do,"
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and that personality may be right, or they may just be repeating something that they have heard,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   and they may not understand the framework,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   but once you understand the theoretical framework behind what we're going to talk about today,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   which is specifically the timing of taxes, the timing of shifting the timing of when you pay taxes,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   a tax planning strategy, then you can quickly look at a personal situation.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I can quickly look at a personal situation.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I can quickly look, gather some facts, and I can say IRA, or I can look and I can say Roth IRA,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   and I know why because I know the framework, so I'm going to share that framework to you.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   It's not a secret, but that's why the framework is important.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   We need both.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   We need framework, and we need technique, so the balance that I'm trying to drive at in this show,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   and I don't know whether I'm doing it successfully or unsuccessfully,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   but the balance that I'm trying to work at is to give you both of these things,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   give you the framework and give you the technique,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   and I believe that the integration, the synthesis between these two things is what will allow you,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   if you're a do-it-yourselfer, to do a much better job of understanding your situation
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   and will allow you, if you're a financial planner of some sort, to do a much better job of helping your clients.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I looked for this information when I was younger.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I couldn't find it.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I couldn't find the framework because I was lost in the world of personal finance,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and in the personal finance, what you have is technique.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   You have theory.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   You have technique, but you don't have the framework, the intellectual framework,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   so I would read through books like I've referenced before on a tax planning book,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   and it would have a list of techniques, but I didn't have any way to fit it in,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   and so, again, where I ultimately found this information was through some of my tax planning books
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   for advanced financial planning designations and also through accounting courses,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and that's where I started to find the framework, and that helped me immensely
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   because then I could synthesize the technique and the framework because techniques come and go.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Tax code changes all the time.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Techniques come and go.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Deductions are added.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Deductions are disallowed.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Tax rates change.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Tax rates are adjusted.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Tax bases are adjusted.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   New taxes are added, so all of that changes as time goes on,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   so if all you have is technique, your technique may soon be invalid.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   What do you do with your planning technique?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   What do you do with your planning technique if your entire financial planning technique
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   is built around the Roth IRA and Congress changes the tax laws about a Roth IRA?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   People scream from the top of the house and say, "This is the worst thing that could ever happen,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   so therefore don't trust the Roth IRA system."
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I don't think there's--I don't have anything to worry about.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I'm not predicting anything, but I do know that Congress changes tax laws all the time,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and so it's theoretically possible.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   If your whole plan was built upon Roth IRAs, your plan falls apart,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   but if you were using the Roth IRA as a tool and you understood the theory,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   you'll just quickly adjust your plan.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I could accomplish exactly the same thing that the--I could accomplish 90% of the things
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   that the Roth IRA accomplishes with other strategies.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   There are other ways to do tax planning depending on the situation.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   So I hope you like this information.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Another thing that you need to understand before we get into this is you need to look at your personal situation.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   All financial planning is and must be intensely personal.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   If you are in a 30% tax bracket, that is very different--
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   there are very different planning needs and planning priorities than if you're in a 0% tax bracket.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   So you need to look to see where it is your bang for the buck--
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   where are you going to get the most bang for the buck in your planning horizon?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   If you are earning a relatively low income and you have a lot of deductions with children
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   and family members and things like that, chances are your biggest bang for the buck
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   is likely not going to come from doing sophisticated tax planning
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   because your tax rates and your tax base is fairly small--
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   your tax base is small and your tax rate is low.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And if you don't know what those words mean, go back and listen to show number 15,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   which was the introductory show to tax planning.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   If you haven't heard that, stop now and go listen to show 15.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   You'll find it at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/15.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   That show was entitled "How to Eliminate Your Taxes--
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   The Basic Foundation You Need to Understand to Do Good Tax Planning."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So you need to understand what is my tax base, what are my tax rates,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   and what are the different taxes that I'm going to be looking at and planning for.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So that show will cover those details for you.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   But it's likely that in terms of your personal finance, if you're at a low--
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   again, if you're in a low-tax environment, your best bang for the buck
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   is probably going to be prioritizing something like yesterday's show,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   talking about communications expenses.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   So yesterday's show, episode 34--excuse me, 35--
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   was about saving on communications expenses, and that built on show number 4.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Or it may come down to how can I dumpster dive or coupon my food
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   and save $400 a month on my food costs.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   So I would encourage you to start there.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   But you should still be preparing for this information.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   So I'm providing this information for you.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I think every person who's broke should be planning to be a billionaire.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   How are you going to become a billionaire if you don't plan to be there?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   So everyone starts somewhere.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   You've got to start with broke and then move on from there.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So look at your situation to see where your biggest bang for the buck
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   is going to come from.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And this information is going to be just as valid for you
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   whether you're making $50,000 a year or $5 million a year.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   This information is going to be every bit as valid
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   because today we're going to be talking about framework.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Now, in future shows with techniques, I'll give you an introduction to technique
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and say here are some techniques that are going to be useful at $50,000 of income
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   and here are some techniques that are going to be useful at $5 million of income.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   So today's show is framework.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   The next point I want to make is the difference between tax planning and non-tax planning.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   This is where essentially you have to start all discussions.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Basically, effective tax planning is all about maximizing the after-tax wealth
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   while also achieving all of your non-tax goals.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Just maximizing after-tax wealth is not a rational goal.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   If the goal were just simply to minimize taxes,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   then the simplest way to do that is just simply earn no income.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So that may be a possibility for you.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   If you can figure out how to live and earn no income,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   and I'm going to profile people on the show who are doing that.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   There's a book on my reading list.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   I can't remember the exact title of it, but it was like The Man Who Lived Without Money,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   something like that.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And I mean I've profiled people.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   That's why I profiled on Friday's show last week.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   I profiled a hobo, the guy that just refuses to work.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I think that's an amazing thing to learn, but it also comes with some disadvantages.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And so if that's the lifestyle you wish to pursue, go for it.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Write a book and I'll read it.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   I would love to – I'll interview you on the show.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   I'd love to interview you about that.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   However, most of us are probably going to find some balance between minimizing the cost of taxes
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   and maximizing the non-tax considerations.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   So you may – if we were just focused on minimizing taxes,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   the fastest and easiest way is just get rid of our income and just don't earn any income.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   But if you're not willing to go through the resulting poverty that would ensue,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   if you're not willing to live that way,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   or if you're not willing to live that way, then that's not a practical way to approach life.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   So good tax planning means that we need to factor in both the tax
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   and the non-tax advantages and costs in every situation.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Almost every financial transaction involves basically three people.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   You have the taxpayer, the other person, the other transacting party, and then the government.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And you need to understand the roles between them
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   because that will allow you to structure win-win deals between you, the taxpayer –
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I'm assuming that in this situation you're the taxpayer – and between the other party.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   So by understanding these, you can structure more advantageous deals.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   And when we get in the future – and I don't know whether this will be a couple years from now or what,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   but when we get into shows talking about how to structure a business transaction,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   how to do stock-for-stock transactions to avoid taxes and things like that,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   and buying and selling corporations, then that's where it's going to be very, very valuable.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   It's going to be important to understand those decisions
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   because large financial transactions don't happen with money, with cash.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   They do happen with money and cash, but there may be other considerations.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   So I want you to understand those three things.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   So we always want to incorporate tax planning and non-tax planning considerations.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   So although we're focusing today on tax planning, a good financial planner is always going to factor in –
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and you, you being a good financial planner for yourself,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   or if you're hiring a good financial planner is always going to factor in the non-tax considerations.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Hopefully those introductory remarks help.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   They're very, very important to understand those as we get into the meat here.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   So as I mentioned at the end of the last show in this tax planning series, which was episode 15,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I mentioned that basically you can boil the major tax planning strategies down to three,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   and those three are timing, shifting, and conversion.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Timing, shifting, and conversion.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Now these are theoretical but eminently practical mental constructs for you to use with tax planning.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And this is how I think.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   As a tax planner, when I hear a technique, I'm quickly thinking,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   "Is this a timing technique, a shifting technique, or a conversion technique?"
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And that helps me to place it in my mind as far as to see where does this belong.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   So timing is basically doing planning with a timing technique.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   It's essentially all about are we taking income today and accelerating income,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   or are we deferring income to a future date?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   So are we moving income up, or are we deferring it?
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And then are we accelerating a tax deduction, or are we deferring a tax deduction?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   That's what timing is.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Shifting is all about shifting income from high-rate taxpayers to low-rate taxpayers.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   That will be in a separate show.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I won't be able to cover that today, but we'll do an entire show on that
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   because there's some very effective techniques that you can use in income shifting,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   and that may be from a corporation to an individual,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   or from an individual to a corporation,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   or from a wealthy family member to a non-wealthy family member,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   or from an individual to a trust, or from a trust to an individual, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And it goes both ways.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   So that's income shifting.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And then conversion is all about converting income from high-rate activities
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   to low-rate activities, and that can be done in a variety of ways,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   whether that's geographic.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   I wrote an article on corporate inversions on Monday's show.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   So that article on corporate inversions, you should understand that.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   That's a conversion strategy.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   The companies that are engaging in corporate inversions right now,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   leaving the United States to go to a lower-taxed authority,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   they're engaging in a conversion.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   They're converting income from high-rate activities to low-rate activities,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   but you can apply conversion strategies to your own individual situation.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   So let's talk about timing.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   When it comes to timing, it's all about when the income is taxed
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   or when an expense is deducted.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   So if you can--in essence, one of the major constructs that you want to have
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   is that any time you can have an expense, that's a deduction,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   and then you can avoid taxes.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   This, if you're an employee and if you've never run a business,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   this may be a concept that you're not familiar to thinking about.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   But in business, you're only taxed on profit.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   So you don't pay--if you earn $10--let's use $100.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   If you earn $100 on services provided, but in order to provide those services,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   you incurred $50 of cost, you're not taxed on the $100 of income.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   That's called gross income.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   You're only taxed on the $50 of net income or profit.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   So in the business world, one of the most important tax planning strategies
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   is to use the deductions that we have available,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and there are many more deductions available on the business side of accounting
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   than there are on the personal side,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   but there are deductions available on the personal side as well.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   So our timing strategy is all about when are we going to take this income,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   when are we going to bring it in, or are we going to bring it in now,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   or are we going to push it to later, and when are we going to take this deduction.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Are we going to push it out and take it in the future,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   or are we going to take it today?
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Now, as part of our timing strategy,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   there are two important things that we've got to keep in mind.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   So now I'm drilling down.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   We've got the three strategies now as part of timing.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   We've got income and deductions,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   and then we've got two important things that we need to keep in mind.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   We need to focus on the present value or the future value of taxes paid or taxes saved,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   and then we also need to focus on the tax rates and any changes in the tax rates.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   And timing strategies are in one way the simplest,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   but in another way the most complicated,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   and we're going to go over the variables.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   I'm going to go over and cover in detail these variables
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   so that you can understand them fully,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   and then you can apply them to your situation.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   So let's start with present value and future value.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   One of the most fundamental concepts of financial planning
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   is the concept of present value.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   This would also be known as the time value of money,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   and the basic idea here is that a dollar today
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   is always worth more than a dollar in the future.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Now, is that true?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   It's true, and the assumption comes from the fact that if you have a dollar today,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   you can invest that dollar and make a positive rate of return.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   If that's true, then you should always, if given the option,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   between having a dollar today and a dollar a year from now,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   you should always choose to have the dollar today so that you can invest it.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Now, I'm going to cover a little bit of math,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   and these formulas are in the show notes.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   If you're driving, don't worry, look at the formulas.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   I think I can cover it in a way that is quick enough
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   and interesting enough to do in an audio podcast,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   but yet still conveys the factor.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   But I want to give you a mathematical formula.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I'm going to give you the future value formula
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   and the present value formula so that you can do the math.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And this math is important.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   We're going to be using it continually, but this math,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   you need to get comfortable with this math.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It's a very simple formula.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   If you don't want to do this, I'll give you two ways to do it.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   I'll give you the formula, and then I'll tell you how to run it on a financial calculator.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   In the future, I hope to be able at some point when I get my production ability to do that,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   and there's probably videos on YouTube already done,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   but I want to teach you how to run a financial calculator
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   because just a simple financial calculator, which you can find online for free,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   if you understand how to run it and how to run a financial calculator,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   it will do far more than all of the web calculators that you find online for you.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   There's a lot of value in the web calculators,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   but the problem is those are all built on the underlying assumptions,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and it's easy to run a calculator and not understand what the assumptions are--
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   the web calculator--not understand what the assumptions are.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   But if you know how to run a financial calculator,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   then it will be valuable for you.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   It's funny.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   When I started as a financial advisor, I didn't know how to run a financial calculator.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Most financial advisors don't.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Most financial advisors just simply don't know how to run it.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And I started it because I thought, "Well, I need to learn this,"
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   and I thought it would be cool if I did it.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   So my dad actually, when I started working in the financial planning business,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   he got me the same calculator he'd always use, which is a classic, an HP-12C,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   which was the classic one that hasn't changed in, I don't know, 80 years, 60 years.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And so I thought it would be fun to learn--I thought it would look cool if I knew how to run it.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   So I just started originally because I thought it looked cool,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   and then I learned how to do it, and I just realized the power of the financial calculator.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And like I've said it before, if you can run a financial calculator,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   you can give a pencil and a legal pad, and I can design a comprehensive financial plan.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   And it's a very, very valuable tool.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   So let's talk about the present value formulas.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   So the first formula that I'm going to start with is the future value formula.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   And please don't--I promise I won't go into too many details to make this boring.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   But the future value formula is the present value times 1 plus r raised to the n.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   This is the calculation that you need to figure out how much money is worth in the future.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   So if we were going to use dollars, and in the 1 plus r, in the mathematical term,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   that 1 plus r is in a parentheses.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   So the present value--I mean, what's the money worth today?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And we're going to multiply that, but we've got to do this other function first,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   times 1 plus r, r being the rate of return, expressed in a decimal.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   So if you had a 10% rate of return, that would be .10.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   So 1 plus .10 equals 1.10, raised to n.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And n is the number of years of the formula that we're investing for.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   So 1 plus r raised to the n, and then multiply that times the number of dollars.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   So if you--let's say that you were going to get a 10% rate of return,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   how you would do this function is you would say a 10% rate of return is 1 plus 1.--
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   excuse me, 1 plus .10 equals 1.10.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Let's just do this for one year.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   So 1 plus .10 raised to the 1 is 1.10.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And let's say you're investing $100.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   You would take $100, and you would multiply that times 1.10,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and that would equal the answer of $110.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   So if you had $100 today, and you could invest it at a 10% rate of return for one year,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   you would have at the end of one year $110.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Intuitive.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Now what if you could do it for two years?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Well, in this situation, all you need to do--and here's where you probably need a calculator--
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   you could do it by hand, but do it with a calculator would be a lot easier.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   So now if you were going to do it for two years, you would do 1 plus .10 is 1.10,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   and you would raise that to 2.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And the answer there, if you were putting it out, the answer would be 1.210.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Then you would multiply that times your $100,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   and multiply 1.210 times 100, and at the end of two years, you would have $121.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   So there would be $10 of interest credited in the first year,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   and then $11 of interest credited in the second year.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   This is the basis of compound interest.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   This is why money grows over time.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   If you were going to do this for 10 years, you would do 1.10, raise that to the power of 10,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   and the answer there would be 2.5937.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Let me just drop this to two decimals.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   So the answer would be 2.59, multiply that times $100, and you would have $259.37.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   So if you could invest $100 today, and you could invest it each year at 10% interest for 10 years,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   at the end of 10 years, you would have $259.37.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   That's the future value formula.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Now, on a financial calculator, you basically have five buttons on your financial calculator that you can operate.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   If you have a financial calculator, get it out, pull it out, or take a look.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I will put a link to an HP 12C, an online calculator I've often used, in the show notes that you can use.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   So the way a financial calculator works is you have these five buttons,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   and these buttons are N, which stands for the number of years, or rather the number of periods.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   So you could use this in years, you could use this in months, you can use it in quarters,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   you can use it in six-month periods.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   And this is important to a financial planner because oftentimes you'll use an annual number,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   but what if someone's contributing monthly?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Well, then you might compound something monthly, or if you were calculating bonds,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   you would compound bonds, or generally the interest is paid twice per year.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   So you would use six-month periods, you could use quarters, you can do whatever you want to do.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   But N is the number of periods, I is the interest rate per period, PV is the present value,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   PMT is the payment, so the cash flows in or the cash flows out, and FV is the future value.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   So if we wanted to check our math on the $259.37, that our $10 would--excuse me,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   our $100 would grow to over 10 years, I could do this.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I would do $100 for my present value, and when you're doing a present value calculation,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   you're going to put that in as a minus.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   So I would change sign, put in $100 as a present value.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   I would put in 10 as my interest rate for 10% annually, compounded annually.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   I would put in 10 for my number of periods.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   I would put in zero for my payments because I'm not putting in any cash flows,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   and I'm not taking cash flows out, and I would press the future value calculator--future value number,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   and then the calculator will calculate, and my answer will be $259.37.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   So I've proved that my formula works both ways, both by using the calculation function
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   and by using my formula.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   If you are a financial planning student or if you are a financial--if you're preparing for something like the CFP exam,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   learn how to do these things both ways, and what you'll find is just by running the financial calculator,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   you can always check yourself, and once you understand the end, the payments, the future value,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and all of that, you can check yourself to make sure that you're getting your formulas correct.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   So this future value formula is very important because we know that a dollar today
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   is much more valuable than a dollar in the future,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   but this depends upon the rate at which we can grow our money.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   So if I offered you $100 today or $100 in a year, which would you choose?
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Well, to run this and calculate this actually, what you would need to do is you would need to run the calculation
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   and see what the present value of the $100 in a year would be today
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   or what the money is worth today and what the money is worth in a year.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   So if we assume that you can grow your money at 10%, which is an assumption,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   and I don't care what number you use, 3%, 8%, 10%, I'm going to use 10% to try to keep the math very simple
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   for those of you who are just listening.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   If we assume that you can grow your money at 10% each year, what I'm actually offering you is
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   would you like to receive, in terms of future value, would you like to receive $110 today or $100?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   And the answer is $110.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   So that's what we're going to choose.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Now, the flip side of this calculation would be the present value.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   So we did a future value calculation that the exact flip side of this is the present value.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   And so from here, we want to always calculate what the present value is.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   So the present value is basically--the formula for the present value is the future value divided by 1 plus r raised to the n.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   So if we had--let's continue with our $100 and 10% number.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   If we were going to use $1, we would use $1, 1 plus .10 and raise that to the number of periods.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   And so if we raise that to 1 period, then the answer of what that would be is 1.10.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   And then putting that into the formula, we would take $1 and divide it by 1.10,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   and we would wind up with an answer of .91.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   And we would call that our discount factor.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   The discount factor is essentially--it is a numerical factor that we can use to apply to figure out what is the present value of money today.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   So I think that's as deep as I need to go into the math.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Look at the formulas and learn to work with these present value and future values.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Now, let's bring it back to taxes.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   What we always want to figure out is would we rather have the cash inflow or the cash outflow today
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   or would we rather have the cash inflow or the cash outflow in the future?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   So let's do an example.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And I am--this is a good example that I read in one of my financial planning textbooks.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And so the example here is let's say that you go to a--let's say that you go to one of these furniture places where they say,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   "We'll give you--we'll sell you furniture today with no money down and no payments for one year."
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   And so let's say that you buy $1,000 worth of furniture and you go--let's say two couches, $1,000 worth of furniture,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   and you decide you're going to do no money down and no payments for one year.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   So the question would be what is that worth to you?
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Ignore all the personal finance nonsense of how the contracts work and fixing it and being in debt and all that stuff.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Let's just figure it out mathematically.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I shouldn't have said the word nonsense.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   It's not nonsense.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   It's important.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   But let's just focus on the math.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   So let's say that you can annually grow your money every year at 10%.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   You have an investment opportunity, whether that's an investment in yourself, whether it's an--let's say that you're going to invest that $1,000 into your own education in some way,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   and you expect that to increase your income by 10%.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   So how much is your deal worth to you?
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Well, the discount factor that we just calculated would be .909, would be the--.91 to .909 would be the discount factor.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   So if you multiply $1,000 times that discount factor of .909, you wind up with the answer of $909.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   So you saved $91 by taking that no money down and no payments for one year number because you either have to pay the $1,000 today or you have to pay the $1,000 one year from now.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   But by pushing your $1,000 payment forward one year, you can now satisfy that payment for only $91 because you can take that $91, invest it at 10%, and that $91 will earn you $9 of interest.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Excuse me, your $909, and that'll earn you $91 of interest, and that'll grow to be the $1,000 that you need.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Let's get out of the math weeds.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   So hopefully this makes sense to you.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   We would always--anytime that we are--anytime that we're going to spend money, the rule is this.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Anytime we're going to spend money, so we're going to have a cash outflow, we want to always take whatever is the lowest present value, the lowest cost.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   And anytime we're going to earn money, we're going to take a cash inflow, we're always going to bring in the higher present value.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   That's the rule.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   So let's apply this present value, future value, and let's look at tax rates and timing of income.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   When it comes to tax rates, we need to understand are tax rates constant or are they changing?
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Constant is simple.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   It's fairly simple.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Changing is a little bit more complicated, and this is why you get so much disagreement in the finance space about what you should do with your money.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   So one economist thinks that tax rates are going down, another economist thinks that tax rates are going up.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   One financial planner says you should--your personal tax rate is going to be lower in retirement.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Another financial planner says your personal tax rate is going to be higher in retirement.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And so the answers would be different depending on what assumptions you use.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   So when tax rates are constant, we want to always accelerate our tax deductions, and we want to defer our income.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And the reason we want to do that is because of this present value calculation.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   If we can accelerate our deduction, then we can invest that money that we save, and it'll have a higher present value than if we take that deduction a year from now.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And if we defer our income to the future and pay those taxes in the future, then we can pay those taxes with cheaper money, money that has a lower present value.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   So when tax rates are constant, we always want to bring up the deductions, and we want to push off our taxable income.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   That's it. It's as simple as that.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   And because we're maximizing the present value of the tax savings from bringing forward the deductions,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   and we're minimizing the present value of the taxes that we're paying by pushing them off.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Now, I'm using the technical financial planner words for this, but this is intuitively true.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   So if the words are confusing to you, just think about this.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   If you have the--let's use IRAs as an example that most people are familiar with.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   If you have the possibility, if you're going to pay the same $100 of tax on the income--so let's assume that you're going to earn the income now,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   you're going to be at the same tax rate now, and you're going to be at a tax rate later.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   If you're going to owe $100 of tax on--let's say it's at an effective--let's use 10%.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Let's say you're in a marginal bracket of 10%.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   So you're going to earn $1,000. That means you're going to owe $100 of tax.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Would you rather pay that $100 of tax today, or would you rather pay that $100 of tax in the future?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Future.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   So you want to accelerate your deduction and defer your income.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   It's as simple as that.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   The key, however, is we need to be careful of when our cash flows are coming in or going out.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I'm not going to spend too much time on this, but it's not--it is as simple as saying,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   "Bring forward the deductions and push off the recognizing the income."
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   But, by the way, recognizing income, that's another accounting word that means
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   that recognition of income means at the point--we now are showing the income at the point we have to pay tax on it.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   So we're going to push off the recognition of the income.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   We may earn it at an earlier period, but we're going to push the recognition back to the time when the taxes are triggered.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   If there is a large cash outflow that we have to incur now in order to get a deduction,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   then we need to run the math very carefully on that, and it's too complicated to do on the podcast,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   but just be aware of that.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   So, essentially, any time you can accelerate a deduction without accelerating the cash outflow that you need to get the deduction,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   then this is going to be your best option.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   So can you actually do this?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Well, yes, absolutely.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   First of all, any type of taxpayer who is a cash method taxpayer, you can often control when you're paying your expenses,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   and so that's a key number is when you are paying your expenses.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   So individuals may do this when it comes to your property taxes.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Let's say you're going to pay your property taxes, and you have the choice to go ahead and pay your property taxes
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   two years' worth in December versus one in December and one in January.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   That would be an option that you have, and if those property taxes are deductible in some way,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   you may choose to accelerate that deduction.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   This is very, very common in businesses.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   So in an accrual method of accounting for a business, then here is where you are going to--you have a little bit more--
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   you have a few more restrictions on you because in accrual, it's not just about when it's--in accrual accounting,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   it's not just when the income is--when you actually get the cash.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   It's about when it's actually earned.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   But you may use an accelerated depreciation schedule for a depreciable asset.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   So a little tax tip for you.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Have you ever heard somebody say, "Buy a heavy car," or you may have heard somebody say, "Buy a heavy luxury car."
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Let me explain.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   This would be a good example of accelerating deductions.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   In this case, the deduction that we're accelerating is a depreciation deduction.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   And let me just give you a little bit of background, and I think you'll understand how you can use these tax strategies
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   to measurably impact the quality of your life if you know what you're doing.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   So businesses often will involve a car.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   So business use will often involve a car.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   If you were running a business, there's a car that's probably involved,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   and you are going to be using that car for business purposes.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   There are tons and tons--by the way, quick disclaimer.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   There are tons of details that I'm trying to avoid going deeply into
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   because it just can't be done in audio format in a compelling way.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   I want to give you big-picture ideas.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Don't do anything with what I'm telling you without going and researching the current law.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   But take what I'm doing as an idea, and then think about it if it may apply to your situation.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   So businesses will often involve running a car.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   So if you were a business owner, and you are in--let's assume you're in a high-tax bracket.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   I'm going to assume you're in a 30% marginal bracket.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   So you're in a relatively high bracket, and you're using a vehicle in your business.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   You have plenty of money.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   You're not worrying about what you're actually spending every month.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   You have enough money.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Would you like to go ahead and have a nicer car?
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   And then because you basically--by running it in your business,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   you basically get a 30% cheaper car.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   If you can buy a luxury automobile, then you can run that luxury automobile
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   and enjoy the 30% break that you get on the expenses that are associated with it.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   So business owners would do that, and they would run a luxury automobile.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Well, that would be politically unpopular, so Congress decided,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   "We're going to limit the deductions that you can take on a luxury car that's used for business."
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   So we understand that you're going to have expenses associated with a normal car,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   but we don't want to allow you to deduct expenses associated with a luxury car.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   We're not willing to let the tax code finance your luxury--your luxury--your luxury's expenses.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   So in 1986, they passed a law that said you cannot take--you cannot--they limited the--
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   excuse me--they limited the deductions that you can take on a luxury car that's used for business.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Now, at that time, basically, the problem was that they--their definition of a luxury car
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   was very different than what maybe your definition of a luxury car would be.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Basically, it would cover any car, even as little as $11,000 in 1986 dollars.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   So they didn't want to impact real business vehicles, like trucks.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   So they said that any car with an unloaded gross vehicle weight over 6,000 pounds,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   so over 3 tons, was exempt.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   So any car with a weight of over 6,000 pounds, then it would not be covered by those limitations.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   So this opened up a--this opened up an opportunity that if your vehicle was heavy enough,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   then you could go ahead and deduct the full amount of it.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   And I'll get through some numbers in just a moment and show you how valuable this is.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   So that could be something like a van. That could be something like a pickup truck.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   That could be something like a large SUV.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   That could be something like a Rolls-Royce.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   You might have some big Rolls-Royce, and it's more than 6,000 pounds.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Is that a luxury car? Absolutely.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   But it was written with--there was an exception because it's more than 6,000 pounds.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   So maybe you're shopping for a Range Rover, and you say, "Well, this is not a luxury car.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   It's more than 6,000 pounds."
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   So people started doing that, and the tax benefits of that were awesome,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   just to be able to take the depreciation.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And basically what happened is that there was--there is a section in the tax code
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   that if you don't have to depreciate property, you can expense it.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   And in general, there's a difference in business taxes between depreciation and expenses.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   So--or excuse me, yeah, between deducting depreciation and expenses.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   If you have equipment that is large and valuable, then you have to depreciate that.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   So what that means is that as the value of the equipment reduces,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   you can only take a small expense.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   So if you buy $100,000 worth of equipment,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   you can't just write off $100,000 in the year that you buy it.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   You have to write it off based upon a depreciation schedule.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   For the simplicity of my show today, ignore the actual depreciation schedule
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   and assume that it means that it's 20% per year for 5 years.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   So let's say that you can write off $20,000 this year, then $20,000 next year,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   then $20,000 the third year, then $20,000, then $20,000.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   So basically this applies generally to real equipment, real property.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Now, there's another thing, however, that allows you to expense certain costs.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   So there's a section in the tax code called--in the U.S. tax code--
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   called Section 179.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   If you can put something in under a Section 179 expense,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   then that allows you to expense the full amount, the full cost of it,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   in the first year.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   And this can be helpful in something like computer equipment.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   So if you can get your computer equipment in under a Section 179 expense
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   instead of in as depreciable equipment, it will save you on taxes now,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   so you're accelerating your deduction.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   So what happened is that for a time, you could actually expense
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   up to $100,000 of business expenses, and that $100,000 could be--
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   if your car were over a certain weight--then that $100,000 expense
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   could actually be applied to your vehicle.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   So now, as a business owner, that allows you to purchase a $100,000 car
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   for your business, a luxury automobile.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Because it's over a certain weight, though, it's not classified
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   to be a luxury automobile.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   And in excess of that--and you could expense the entire thing,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   which means that you would save the $30,000 of taxes
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   that you otherwise would have incurred in buying the car
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   and using after-tax dollars.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   So this is an awesome strategy.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   And in case you're wondering why I think that the tax--
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   and why I and most economists think that the tax code
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   should be completely simplified, it's because rich people have the money
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   to sit around and pay people to--well, pay people to sit around
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   and think up this stuff.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And poor people don't do it.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   So I'm just giving you the information now.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   So people were taking advantage of this.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   It was a great market.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   I'm sure Range Rovers sold lots of vehicles.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Hummer, Chevys, Suburbans--they should be over 6,000 pounds.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   These big vehicles, they did awesome.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   And so it accounted for major sales.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   So then the tax code changed.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   So then in 2004, Congress updated the tax code,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   and they changed the limits.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   And instead of it being 6,000 pounds, then those limits became 14,000 pounds.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Well, now that disqualifies basically anything except an actual truck.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   And there were still some limits for vehicles between 6,000 and 14,000 pounds,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   but it's a much lower number, and there's a much lesser pool.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   So now if you want to get your vehicle depreciation,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   you're going to have to drive a big old truck every day,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   not a 6,000-pound Rolls-Royce.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   This could still be applied to something like a heavy pickup truck,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   and this would be valuable for you if you were running something like a construction company.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   If you were deciding between a half-ton pickup truck and a one-ton pickup truck,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   it would be valuable for you to know.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   So the laws changed.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   But here would be--and even with the limitations, though, the knowledge of this--
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   I'll give you one example here, and I'll read from half of a paragraph from--
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   let's see, which book is this?
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   This is Jeff Schnepper's "How to Pay Zero Taxes" book,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   and he gives some great examples here.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   But from page 737--and this is last year's edition--it says, "In 2012--
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   so if you buy a new"--this is for 2012--
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   "If you buy a new $60,000 SUV with a loaded gross weight over 6,000 pounds,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   you can expense the first $25,000."
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   So because it's over 6,000 pounds, you can expense the first $25,000,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   but you can't expense the full amount like you used to be able to.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   "Half the remaining $35,000 cost," which would be $17,500,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   "qualified as bonus depreciation.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   You also get 20% of the leftover basis," which would be $17,500,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   "or $3,500 as regular depreciation.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Use the car 100% for business, and you get a $46,000 first-year deduction."
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   So this wouldn't apply to used vehicles.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   So the example here is if you are running a business,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   and let's say that you're going to buy a $60,000 SUV--
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   let me pause here and run the math real quick.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Okay, so I ran the math, and basically if you were to follow these rules,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   it would allow you to buy a new $60,000 vehicle
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   for a cost of--out-of-pocket cost--of about $46,000
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   because of about $14,000 of savings due to a $46,000 first-year deduction
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   and a 30% bracket.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   So this would be a good example of how, when someone's in a high bracket,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   by accelerating the deduction by using this strategy,
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   and this would also be an example of a shifting strategy, of a conversion,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   converting expenses if you could convert them over
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   from the personal checkbook over to the business checkbook,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   this would be how you can make a major savings.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   It allows you to buy a new $60,000 car for a cheaper price
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   than some other people might pay for a used car
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   because all those rules are only applicable to new cars.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   So hopefully that's a good example to say that this stuff actually does matter.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   I always get scared that I'm getting too deep,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   and I don't know if I'm getting too deep or not.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   You tell me if this was too deep or if this is good.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   So you can accelerate deductions, and if you can accelerate deductions,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   that will be extremely valuable.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   You can also defer income.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   So if you can defer the recognition of income
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   without deferring the actual receipt of it,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   that would be a really amazing thing as well.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   So this is why IRAs are such a useful tool
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   because the IRA law is explicit about the fact
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   that you can defer recognizing the income for tax purposes
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   without deferring receiving the income.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   So you can actually receive the income.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   You have constructive receipt, which we'll talk about in just a minute.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   It's on my notes to go over constructive receipt.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   You have the receipt of the income so that you can go ahead and invest it.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   So you can invest the money because you have received it.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   It's in your 401(k) account, but it is not recognized for taxes.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   And I'm going to go over constructive receipt in a minute
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   because it'll fit in better.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   So that would be a good real-world example.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   So that finishes up as far as the timing strategy
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   when tax rates are constant.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Well, what about if tax rates are going to change?
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   This is a problem.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   So this is why financial planning is in some ways a science
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   but is in other ways an art,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   and why financial planning has to be integrated with economic analysis
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   and it has to be run personally.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   When tax rates are constant, it's easy to do the math,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   but we don't know what tax rates are going to do.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   In the last 25 years, Congress has changed tax rates at least nine times.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   So if you go back and look at it, you'll see what are the maximum tax rates
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   that are applied to ordinary income or capital gains.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   They've changed no fewer than nine times.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   So how do we know what Congress is going to do?
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   Well, we don't.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   The marginal brackets changed just this last year,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   and depending on what you think about the political climate of this country,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   will it change more in the future?
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   I don't know. I bet it's going to change.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   Which way is it going to change? I don't know.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   Now, here's where you'd have to look at an individual situation
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   if you're talking about individual income taxes.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Are you in a very high bracket or are you in a moderate bracket?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   The reality is that effective brackets haven't changed much for the majority of people,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   but they have changed at the margin.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   So this is where you have to look at an individual.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   So is the overall rate going to change, and what about your rate?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   So is your rate going to change because you lowered your income,
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   because you raised your income, because you changed jobs,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   because you retired, because you started a new business,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   because you're pursuing a strategy of early financial independence?
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Your own personal rates are going to be a major factor.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   So we've got to figure out, are rates increasing or are rates decreasing?
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   And this is a big question, because depending on if rates are going up
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   or if rates are going down, then this is going to make a big difference
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   as far as should we bring income forward or should we defer income.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   In general, the higher the rate, the higher the tax rate,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   the higher the tax savings for a tax deduction.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   The lower the tax rate, the lower the tax costs for taxable income.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   So everything being equal, in general, you would want to recognize your deductions
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   during high tax rate years, and you would want to recognize income
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   during low tax rate years.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   So all things being equal for retirement, if you are going to be at a higher tax rate
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   while working than you are in retirement, which, by the way, most people will be,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   you're going to want to recognize more of your deductions during your working years,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   and you're going to want to defer your income towards your non-working years.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Now, is that precise?
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   It's precise if you know what tax rates are going to be
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   and what your personal tax rate is going to be,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   but the problem is you don't know that.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   Now, you can do some calculations, some in general calculations,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   but ultimately this is incredibly personal,
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   and that's why you have to look at the personal numbers.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   If tax rates are increasing--this is the really challenging one--
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   because if tax rates are increasing, you have to do a complete calculation,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   and you have to figure out what is the actual calculation.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   There's no rule, because you would look and say,
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   "How much are the tax rates increasing?
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   Am I going from a 25% bracket to a 28% bracket?"
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   And then you would calculate the present value of a tax deduction
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   or calculate the value of the income.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   So you have to do the calculation, and I can't give you a rule for that.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   If tax rates are decreasing,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   then you're going to want to bring forward your deductions,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   and you're going to want to push back and defer your income,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   depending on whether rates are going up or rates are going down.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   Are there some general strategies that you can pull from this?
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   I think there are, and that's why most financial planners
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   would rather you take deductions now rather than in retirement.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   It's very hard to get the tax code to say
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   that you're going to be in a higher tax rate at retirement
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   than during your working years.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   It's very hard to get that to happen
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   if, indeed, tax rates stay similar to what they are now
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   or close to what they are now.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   However, is it possible that tax rates could change dramatically?
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   Sure they could. Brackets could change, absolutely.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   And so is it likely that you're going to be? I don't know. It would depend.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   Are you making $5 million a year or $50,000 a year?
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   There's no political will in this country for--
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   or, frankly, most countries--
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   to move the bulk of the tax burden onto people making $50,000 a year.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   There is a tremendous, it seems, political will
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   to move the bulk of the tax burden onto people making $5 million a year.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   So you would have to consider this for yourself.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   So let's wrap up now with a couple of challenges
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   and then a couple of examples
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   and then a couple of challenges and a couple of examples.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   So timing strategies do have limitations.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   One of the limitations, for example, would be, in general,
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   if you're going-- let's say that you're going to invest in an asset.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   You're going to invest in stocks.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   You can defer your income.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   You can defer recognizing the income on the stock
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   if it's going up in value until you sell it.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   But you can't defer it any longer until you sell it,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   assuming it's held in a taxable brokerage account.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   So you can't let the tax strategy wag--
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   you can't let the tail wag the dog, so to speak.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   You can't let the tax strategy dictate your investment decisions.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   You have to make your investment decisions
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   and then figure out how to make them appropriate to the tax strategy.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   And when I explain something like that,
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   you can see, then, how valuable some of the tools like tax-deferred accounts can be
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   because a tax-deferred account does allow you to--
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   if you can do all of your trading in an account
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   that does allow you to defer the income completely,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   then--so such as a Roth IRA.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Let's say you can do all of your trading inside of the Roth IRA.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   Well, then now you can ignore the tax consequences of your trades,
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   and you can buy and sell, buy and sell, buy and sell,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   because the tax consequences are already squared away.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   But then again, you have to pay income taxes on that money.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   It may be better for you to use--if you're using--
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   you have limits as far as who can participate in those accounts.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   So there's a lot of things interplaying here.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   And in fact, I forgot--I was trying to stay away from using U.S.-centric examples.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   If you're an international listener,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   today's show should be completely valid to your local tax environment
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   because the concepts are the same no matter what tax environment
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   and no matter what tax authority you're dealing with.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   So you do have some limitations.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   And then you get the whole question of can you afford to defer income.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   If you are a single mom and you're raising--you're a single mom with three kids
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   and you're earning minimum wage, you probably can't afford to defer income.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   So this whole idea of Joshua has this fancy tax strategy of,
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   "I'm going to defer my income," this is pointless.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   This doesn't do any good for you because you need the money now.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   But if you don't need the money, then there's a lot that you can do.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   I was working on some tax strategies for an early retirement person,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   a popular early retirement personality,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   and I was just struck by how if you are able to save a huge percentage of your income,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   man, it allows you to be so efficient.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   It's amazing.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   If you don't need the money that you're earning,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   it's amazing how efficient you can be from a tax flow perspective.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   So consider the non-tax scenarios and the tax scenarios.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   You've got to always consider both of these things.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Are you going to defer income forward or are you going to pull it back?
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   And I want to finish with constructive receipt,
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   and this is both a limitation but an advantage.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   So there is a doctrine in tax law that is called the constructive receipt doctrine.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   And basically the idea is that if you receive money, if it is yours,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   you can't pretend it's not.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   So you would think if you're an individual,
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   say you're an individual employee, then you would think,
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   "Well, if someone gives me money, then, yeah, I'm going to go ahead and get it."
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   But here would be the example.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   So if I give you a check on December 1, 2014,
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   and I'm making a payment to you on December 1, 2014,
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   when do you receive the money?
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   Do you receive the money on December 1, 2014?
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   Or if you just simply put the check in your drawer and don't cash it
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   until January 10, 2015, did you receive it on January 10, 2015?
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   Or did you receive it on December 1, 2014?
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   Or just whatever the date I said was.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   Which year did you receive it in?
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   Well, the answer is that you received it when I gave you the check
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   because you must report your income when the income is received,
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   whether it's received in the form of cash, received in the form of property,
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   or received in the form of services.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   You must recognize the income when it is actually or constructively received.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   And so constructive receipt means that you are legally--
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   you are assumed to have received the money
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   if the income has been credited to your account
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   or if the income is unconditionally available to you
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   or if you are aware of the income's availability to you
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   and if there are no restrictions on the taxpayer's control over the income.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   So let's say that I give you the check.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   That means that you've received it.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   I've given you the check.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   It's unconditionally available to you.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   You're aware of it being available to you,
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   and there's no restrictions on your control over the income.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   So what if I put the check in your box?
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   Let's say that you work for me as an employee
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   and I decide to put the check into your box
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   and you're going to receive a bonus check at the end of the year,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   and I deposit it there on December the 20th.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   But you don't want--and it's a $100,000 bonus--
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   but you don't want to get the $100,000 bonus,
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   so you just decide, "You know what?
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   "I'm going to go away and I'm going to take the last two weeks of the year off,
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   "and I'm not going to go into work and pick up the check,
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   "and I'm going to pretend I don't know that it's there."
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   Would that get you out? No.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   Under the doctrine of constructive receipt,
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   you have control over the income.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   You could go into your box at work or into your desk
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   and you could pick up the check.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   So even though you said, "I'm not going to go in and get it,"
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   you still got it. You still received it.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   So now, does Congress catch--excuse me--
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   does the IRS catch most people that do things like this
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   when they push things forward or push things back?
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   Probably not.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   There's a very low audit rate.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   Many people do this all the time.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Does the IRS really care if you are going to screw around
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   with your $5,000 end-of-year bonus check?
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   I don't think so.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   Probably--I mean, they care if they're auditing you,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   but you're not a--you're not a big target.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   What about a $5 million check?
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   And that's where the IRS is going to get involved.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   So this doctrine of constructive receipt
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   will actually influence just about all of our planning.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   And when we get to talking through financial planning strategies
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   such as, let's say, non-qualified deferred compensation programs,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   which that's probably a mouthful for you,
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   but a non-qualified deferred comp,
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   one of the things that we're going to get to
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   is you figure out who has the money.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Has the employee received--constructively received the money,
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   or does the employer still have it?
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   And when you, as a business consultant or a benefits consultant--
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   when I'm designing a plan--
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   let's say I'm designing--let's say I'm working with a physician, okay?
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   And this physician has a small independent medical practice.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   Let's ignore group practice because that's more complicated.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   And the physician is making $500,000 a year.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   And I'm sitting here, and he says,
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   "Joshua, I need help with my tax planning strategies."
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   Well, frankly, if you're earning $500,000 a year,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   a 401(k) doesn't get you that far.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   A $17,500 that you can defer may be an additional $5,000,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   so a total of $22,500 that you can defer out of your income
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   if you're over the age of 50.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   And a business--let's see what that number is.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   So $22,500.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   So this guy says to me, "Joshua, great.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   "I can defer a total of 5% of my income into--
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   is that right, $500,000?
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   No. Yeah, right.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   So I can defer under 5% of my income there.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   That doesn't get me where I'm trying to go.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   I'm 55 years old, I'm a successful physician,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   and I'm trying to defer my income into--
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   I'm trying to build it for retirement,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   and I'm just sick and tired of this tax bill that I have.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   Well, $22,000 doesn't get me there.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   So let's say then that I can go ahead and I can say,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   "Well, let's design your 401(k) plan properly,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   and let's max it out.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   So let's design it where instead of the $22,500 limit,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   let's use the other sections of the code,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   and let's get you to the ability to defer $17,500
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   and to contribute an additional amount."
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   So you can contribute $50,000, and then on top of that,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   you can do your additional $5,000 catch-ups.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   So now we're at a point where we're doing $55,000
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   into your 401(k) plan.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   So he's a little bit happier with me.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   He's got the fruit.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   All we need is just simply to strike the documents appropriately.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   This is easy, easy to do.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   Now he's deferring--you know, he's basically taking 10% of his income.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   But he says, "Look, I'm 55 years old. I still can't afford it."
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   Well, now we move over into the world of non-qualified deferred comp.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   And so what this means is saying,
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   "How can we set up a plan to allow you to defer--
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   can we do a couple hundred thousand dollars a year?"
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   Well, the answer is yes, and we are not going to go into it today,
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   but we can set up a plan so he can defer $250,000 of income into this plan.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   We've got to set it up with him and his employees.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   We've got to make sure that we're very careful in how we do it.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   But we need to make sure that he does not have constructive receipt of the money.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   The money is not available to him.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   Because if he has constructive receipt of the money,
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   then he's going to be taxed on it.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   So we have to make sure that this is still an asset of the business
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   and not his personal asset.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   This is still--that we have to make sure that this is available to his creditors.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   So if his business were to be sued,
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   then we need to make sure that this retirement plan is available to his creditors.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   And this brings in--if you're a financial planning student,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   this would be why you can only do non-qualified deferred comp
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   with a corporation, with a C corporation.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   You can't do it with an S corporation.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   So if you're taking a CFP exam, if you ever see S corp
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   and non-qualified deferred comp, you know that's wrong.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   Non-qualified deferred comp must--is only useful in C corporations.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   And the reason is because it has to remain an asset of the business
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   under the doctrine of constructive receipt.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   Or you could--we'd have to make--so then you would--so you say,
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   "Well, can we get some other protection in place?"
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   You know, "Could we set up a rabbi trust?" is what it's called.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   If you're a financial planning student, you need to understand what a rabbi trust is.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   So can we pull this money out into a trust?
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   Yes and no. That's a show for another day.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   I went too deep. I didn't mean to go into that.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   My point was to say this.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   In tax planning, you only need to understand the doctrine of constructive receipt.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   And if you understand the doctrine of constructive receipt,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   you now understand why it's important when you receive the income
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   and you can--and you receive the income when it is available to you as a person.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   So that is income timing strategies.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   Man, I'm done.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   I hope that that was useful.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   Again, I would crave your feedback on these shows.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   If you're enjoying them, let me know.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   If you're not enjoying them, let me know.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   And I don't promise to change anything because you let me know,
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   but I do want to know because what I want to do is I want to strike the balance.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   I want to kind of provide something for everybody,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   but I don't want you to listen to this and get my show and get the same old, same old--
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   I want you to listen and have 18 tips for couponing every day
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   because the reality is there's more that you can do with that.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   And hopefully you feel--hopefully you are smarter today.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   Hopefully you are more educated about taxes and about income timing strategies.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   Ah, sorry, last thing I wanted to say.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   Income timing, you can do some wizardry with income timing strategies
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   if you are off the mainstream, or even if--you could do some amazing stuff with income timing.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   If you haven't checked out what the Madfientist is doing over on his site,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   Brandon is the Madfientist.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   His site is madfientist, F-I-E-N-T-I-S-T dot com.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   All of his strategies are--most of his strategies are income timing strategies.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   And he interviewed--there's another blog you should check out.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   Let me make a note to make sure I get it in the show notes called Go Curry Cracker,
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   a crazy blog name, but these guys are writing a lot about taxes
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   from an early retirement financial independence--Go Curry Cracker--and Madfientist.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   And check out their writing.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   But all that they're doing is income timing strategies.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   So what I mean is that Brandon, for example, he is writing this--
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   he has this awesome case study on his site which is really accessible to you,
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   and he goes through and shows how if you can earn a reasonable wage
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   and if you can live on a very small amount of it,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   you can use some very straightforward 401(k) deductions, HSA deductions, IRA deductions.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   You can use some very straightforward tax planning techniques
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   to push off the timing of the income to a future date.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   Then you can retire at an early age.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   You can use the transition from a 401(k) or from an IRA into a Roth IRA,
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   stay underneath the tax brackets,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   and you can basically get the income with zero taxes associated with it.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   So he's doing a really great job of showing how this type of strategy can work in that scenario.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   That's not going to work if you're earning $5 million a year
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   and you're listening to my show and saying, "How can I do this?
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   We need to use something else, but we're still going to be using an income timing strategy."
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   So hopefully by understanding this strategy a little bit more and having some good examples,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   then you can start thinking to yourself, "Should I bring my income forward or should I defer it?
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   What's my rates going to be? Are my rates going to be constant?
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   And if my rates are constant, then I'm going to defer income
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   and I'm going to bring deductions forward.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   If my rates are increasing, then I'm going to do the math.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   If my rates are decreasing, do the math.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   Excuse me, if my rates are decreasing, then I'm going to bring deductions forward
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   and move income off."
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   And hopefully you can start to think this way.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Hopefully that's a good place to end on today's show.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   I want to know if you've heard this anywhere else in any of the podcasts, let me know.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   If you've headed to luxury automobile depreciation, non-qualified deferred comp,
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   and Roth IRA early retirement strategies, I hope I didn't lose you.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   I hope I didn't lose you. My disease is trying to pack too much.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   I'm trying to make these shorter and make them more doable.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   Hey, an hour and seven minutes right now for the recording.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   That's pretty good. I'm pretty proud of that.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Going to have some more shows lined up for you this week,
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   and I'm going to continue these tax planning shows little by little as time goes on.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   We're going to do some insurance stuff. We're going to do some investment stuff.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   We're going to do some college stuff. I've got a bunch of these shows planned.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   I thank you for listening.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   Two action steps for you, three action steps for you.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   If you've enjoyed the show or if you hated the show, let me know.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   RadicalPF is me on Twitter, so shoot me a tweet @radicalpf or shoot me an email at Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   Let me know what you thought of the show.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   Thing two, I would request, please go and rate the show on iTunes.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   If you hated it, say, "I hated this show."
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   If you loved it, say, "I loved this show," and that rating would be so, so helpful to help people find the show.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   One of the things that when people are looking at shows, they look a lot at the ratings,
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   and the ratings and the number of reviews makes a huge difference.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   So please, I would just ask you, if you want to support the show, go and leave a rating on iTunes.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   And finally, sign up for the email list.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   I'm going to be, as soon as I'm able to, little by little, I'm going to be adjusting the email list a little bit
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   to try to bring more content and make it look nicer as I'm able to.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   But for now, go and sign up for the email list, and you'll get the full, complete show notes every day,
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   both for your files with the resources, recommendations, and also so you can hear about the show
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   and see if it's a subject that you're interested in that you want to listen to
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   or if it's a subject that you want to skip for the day.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   Go kick some butt and figure out your own income timing strategy.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   Have a great Wednesday, everybody.
