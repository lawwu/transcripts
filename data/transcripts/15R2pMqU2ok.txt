[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.060]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.620]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.500]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.860]   Today, we are going to discuss the gut and the brain,
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.700]   and we are going to discuss how your gut influences
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.140]   your brain and your brain influences your gut.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.860]   As many of you probably know,
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.640]   there is a phenomenon called your gut feeling,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.460]   which tends to be something that you seem to know
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.920]   without really knowing how you know it.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.920]   That's one version of the gut feeling.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.800]   The other is that you sense something in your actual gut,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.420]   in your body, and that that somehow drives you to think
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.520]   or feel or act in a particular way,
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.120]   maybe to move towards something
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.280]   or to move away from something.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.200]   Now, today, we aren't going to focus so much
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.840]   on the psychology of gut feelings,
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.280]   but on the biology of gut feelings
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.100]   and how the gut and brain interact,
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.580]   because indeed your gut is communicating to your brain
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.080]   both directly by way of neurons, nerve cells,
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.340]   and indirectly by changing the chemistry of your body,
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.980]   which permeates up to your brain
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.940]   and impacts various aspects of brain function.
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.820]   But it works in the other direction too.
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.000]   Your brain is influencing your entire gut.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.280]   And when I say entire gut, I don't just mean your stomach,
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.420]   I mean your entire digestive tract.
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.740]   Your brain is impacting things
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.280]   like how quickly your food is digesting,
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.020]   the chemistry of your gut.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.360]   If you happen to be stressed or not stressed,
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.640]   whether or not you are under a particular social challenge
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.280]   or whether or not you're particularly happy
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.040]   will in fact adjust the chemistry of your gut
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.300]   and the chemistry of your gut in turn
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.740]   will change the way that your brain works.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.240]   I'll put all that together for you
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.200]   in the context of what we call the gut microbiome.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.820]   The gut microbiome are the trillions of little bacteria
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.040]   that live all the way along your digestive tract
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.800]   and that strongly impact the way that your entire body works
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.340]   at the level of metabolism, immune system,
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.720]   and brain function.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.680]   And of course, we will discuss tools,
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.400]   things that you can do in order to maintain
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.440]   or improve your gut health.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.680]   Because as you'll also soon see,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.080]   gut health is immensely important
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.560]   for all aspects of our wellbeing
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.520]   at the level of our brain, at the level of our body.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.240]   And there are simple actionable things that we can all do
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.740]   in order to optimize our gut health
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.960]   in ways that optimize our overall nervous system functioning.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.780]   So we will be sure to review those today.
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.340]   This episode also serves as a bit of a primer
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.980]   for our guest episode that's coming up next week
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.320]   with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg from Stanford University.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.440]   Dr. Sonnenberg is a world expert in the gut microbiome
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.800]   and so we will dive really deep into the gut microbiome
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.480]   in all its complexity.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.000]   We'll make it all very simple for you.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.740]   We will also talk about actionable tools in that episode.
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.760]   This episode is a standalone episode
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.820]   so you'll get a lot of information and tools,
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.360]   but if you have the opportunity to see this episode first,
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.160]   I think it will serve as a nice primer
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.860]   for the conversation with Dr. Sonnenberg.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.440]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.200]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.260]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.920]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.760]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.840]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.720]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.960]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.560]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.040]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.480]   I've been using Athletic Greens,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.820]   which is now called AG1 since 2012.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.460]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.280]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.800]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.780]   once or twice a day is that it covers
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.260]   all of my foundational vitamin and mineral needs
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.680]   and also because it contains high quality probiotics
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.900]   and prebiotics, which is a topic
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.680]   that we're going to talk a lot about today.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.880]   With Athletic Greens, I can be sure that I'm getting
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.900]   all the vitamins and minerals that I need.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.980]   So if I'm missing anything in my diet,
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.520]   I can compensate for that with the Athletic Greens.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.320]   Plus it has the probiotics and prebiotics
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.520]   that can also compensate for any deficiencies
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.480]   that I might have in creating the right environment
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.040]   for my gut microbiome.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.400]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.320]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.680]   to claim a special offer.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.240]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.720]   which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.200]   while you're in the car or on a plane
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.440]   or otherwise on the move,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.680]   and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.240]   While not everyone needs additional vitamin D3,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.200]   many people do, even if they're getting sufficient sunlight.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.800]   So you get the year supply of vitamin D3
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.040]   and it also has K2 in there.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.100]   K2 has been shown to be important for various aspects
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.000]   of calcium regulation, cardiovascular health, and so on.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.700]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.200]   to claim this special offer.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.180]   Element is an electrolyte drink that contains no sugar.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.200]   It does, however, contain sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.020]   I've talked about sodium on the podcast before.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.740]   I think sodium can indeed be problematic for some people
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.920]   with hypertension or pre-hypertension,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.000]   but for many people, sodium is a great thing.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.160]   It can increase blood volume
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.720]   in ways that can be helpful to them.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.540]   It can improve nerve cell function
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.160]   in ways that can be helpful to them.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.580]   And for me, anytime I'm exercising and sweating a lot,
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.000]   I want to replace my electrolytes,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.480]   and that means replacing sodium
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.060]   for adequate neuron function, muscle function, and so on.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.720]   Element is formulated to help anyone
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.060]   with their electrolyte needs
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.580]   and is perfectly suited for people
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.180]   who are following a ketogenic, low carbohydrate,
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.840]   or paleo diet.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.300]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.140]   of 1000 milligrams of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.420]   and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.600]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.680]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.620]   to claim a free Element sample pack.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.280]   You only pay the cost of shipping.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.280]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.960]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.900]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.320]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.920]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.520]   to help you better understand your body
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.540]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.480]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.640]   for the simple reason that many of the things
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.700]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.320]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.160]   And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.440]   you can also get insights into, for instance,
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.580]   what your biological age is
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.220]   and how that compares to your chronological age.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.500]   Now, one of the major problems
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.840]   with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.280]   is that you get numbers back.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.800]   They'll tell you if those numbers are in range
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   and out of range, but they don't tell you anything
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   about what to do with that information.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.300]   With Inside Tracker, they make everything very simple
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.780]   in terms of directing you towards particular protocols.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.720]   So these could be nutrition protocols,
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.320]   supplementation protocols,
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.260]   or lifestyle behavioral protocols
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.680]   to help you bring those numbers into the ranges
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.240]   that are best for you.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.660]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.240]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.080]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.960]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.360]   Okay, let's talk about the gut and the brain
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.360]   and how your gut and your brain communicate
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.100]   in both directions.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.600]   Because as I mentioned before,
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.300]   your gut is communicating all the time with your brain
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.360]   and your brain is communicating all the time with your gut.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.040]   And so the two are in this ongoing dance with one another
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.180]   that ordinarily is below your conscious detection.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.340]   Although you're probably familiar with the experience
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.700]   of every once in a while getting a stomach ache
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.740]   or of eating something that doesn't agree with you
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.420]   or conversely eating something
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.840]   that you find particularly delicious.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.800]   And that sensation or that experience rather
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.760]   being a whole body experience.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.740]   Your mind is excited about what you're eating or just ate.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.160]   Your gut is excited about what you're eating or just ate.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.040]   And it seems to be a kind of unified perception
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.080]   of both brain and body.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.280]   Today, we're going to talk about how that comes about
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.640]   in the negative sense.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.520]   Like, you know, when you meet someone you really dislike
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.840]   or when you have a stomach ache and in the positive sense,
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.920]   when you interact with somebody that you really, really like
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.160]   and you'd like to spend more time with them, for instance,
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.880]   or when you eat something that you really, really like
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.800]   and you'd like to spend more time with that food,
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.060]   so to speak.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.600]   Now, the gut and the brain represent
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.200]   what we call a biological circuit.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.880]   Meaning they include different stations.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.600]   So station A communicates with station B,
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.200]   which communicates with station C and so on.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.480]   And as I mentioned earlier, it is bi-directional.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.240]   It's a two-way street between gut and brain.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.000]   I want to make the important point at the outset
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.400]   that when I say the word gut, when I refer to the gut,
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.480]   I'm not just referring to the stomach.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.720]   Most of us think that the gut equates to the stomach
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.960]   because we think of having a gut or not having a gut
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.760]   or having a gut feeling of some sort.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.200]   But in the context of gut-brain signaling
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.780]   and the related microbiome,
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.500]   the gut includes the entire digestive tract.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.240]   That's right, from start to finish,
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.040]   the entire digestive tract.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.740]   So much so that today we're going to talk about,
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.800]   for instance, the presence of neurons, nerve cells
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.420]   that reside in your gut,
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.600]   that communicate to specific locations in the brain
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.240]   and cause the release of specific neurochemicals,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.480]   such as the neurochemical dopamine or serotonin,
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.760]   that can motivate you to seek more of a particular food
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.960]   or type of interaction or behavior,
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.520]   or to avoid particular foods, interactions, and behaviors.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.580]   And some of those neurons, many of those neurons, in fact,
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.680]   reside in your intestines, not in your stomach.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.540]   They can be in the small intestine or the large intestine.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.120]   In fact, you actually have taste receptors and neurons
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.800]   located all along your digestive tract.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.420]   You have neurons that are located all along your digestive
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.420]   tract, and they are communicating to your brain
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.780]   to impact what you think, what you feel, and what you do.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.300]   Okay, so for the gut-brain axis,
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.880]   we need to deal with the brain part,
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.040]   and then we need to deal with the gut part.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.840]   Let's just quickly talk about the brain part,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.560]   because there, the word brain is also a bit of a misnomer
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.900]   in that when we say the gut-brain axis,
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.180]   it does include the brain,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.280]   but it includes a lot of other things as well.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.660]   So as many of you probably know by now,
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.780]   if you're listeners of this podcast, and if you don't,
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.120]   that's fine, your nervous system includes your brain
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.640]   and your spinal cord, and those together constitute
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.240]   what's called the central nervous system.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.440]   Your neural retinas, which are lining the back of your eyes
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.340]   and are the light sensing portion of your eyes,
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.680]   are also part of your central nervous system.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.780]   So actually, your eyes are part of your brain.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.940]   They're the only parts of your brain
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.960]   that are outside the cranial vault.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.020]   So your retinas, your brain proper,
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.580]   and your spinal cord make up the central nervous system.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.900]   The other parts of your nervous system
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.960]   constitute what's called the peripheral nervous system,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.660]   which are the components of your nervous system
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.600]   that reside outside the retinas, brain, and spinal cord.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.720]   Now, this is very important
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.340]   because today we're going to talk a lot
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.120]   about how the gut communicates with the brain,
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.700]   and it does that by way
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.980]   of peripheral nervous system components,
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.460]   meaning nerve cells that reside in the gut
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.240]   and elsewhere in the body that communicate to the brain
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.920]   and cross into the central nervous system
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.760]   to influence what you think and what you feel, okay?
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.700]   So that's the nervous system part
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.360]   of what we call the gut-brain axis.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.840]   Brain, again, just being a shorthand
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.820]   for including all the elements I just described.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.020]   Gut, as you now know,
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.520]   includes all the elements of the digestive tract.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.620]   Let's talk about the architecture or the structure
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.520]   of the gut of your digestive system.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.420]   Now, not surprisingly, your digestive system,
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.100]   AKA your gut, begins at your mouth and ends at your anus.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.960]   And all along its length, there are a series of sphincters
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.300]   that cut off certain chambers of the digestive tract
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.460]   from the other chambers.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.920]   Now, also along this tube that we call the digestive tract,
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.100]   there's great variation in the degree of acidity or pH,
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.400]   as it's sometimes called.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.960]   That variation in acidity turns out to give rise
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.520]   to different little micro environments
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.280]   in which particular microbiota, micro bacteria,
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.480]   can thrive or fail to thrive.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.960]   And so the way I'd like you to think
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.300]   about the digestive tract,
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.380]   this gut component of the gut-brain axis,
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.620]   is that it's not just one component.
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.440]   It's not just your stomach with a particular acidity
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.400]   and a bunch of microorganisms that work particularly well
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.280]   to make you feel good and make your digestive pathways
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.120]   work well.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.340]   It's a series of chambers, little micro environments
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.280]   in which particular microbiota thrive
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.740]   and other microbiota do not.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.600]   And certain behaviors that you undertake
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   and certain experiences that you have
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.080]   will adjust those micro environments
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.600]   in ways that make particular microbiota, certain bacteria,
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.000]   more likely to thrive and others less likely to thrive.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.840]   We'll talk about how that was set up for you
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.180]   early in life.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.320]   Actually from the moment that you came into the world,
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.680]   that microbiome was being established.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.680]   It was actually strongly impacted,
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.840]   depending on whether or not you were born by C-section
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.960]   or by vaginal birth.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.920]   And it was strongly impacted by who handled you
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.840]   when you came into the world.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.800]   Literally the hands that were on you,
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.560]   how much skin contact you had,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.840]   whether or not you were a preemie baby or not,
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.180]   whether or not you had pets at home,
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.800]   whether or not you were allowed to play in the dirt,
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.240]   whether or not you were allowed to eat snails
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.480]   or whether or not you were kept
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.360]   in a very antiseptic environment.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.760]   All of those experiences
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.180]   shaped these little micro environments
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.000]   and shaped what constitutes best or worst
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.880]   for those micro environments.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.240]   So you have this long tube that we call the digestive tract
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.360]   and it's very, very long.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.600]   In fact, if we were to splay it out,
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.840]   we were to take all the curves and turns
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.900]   out of the intestine, we would find that it is very long.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.920]   It's approximately nine meters long.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.680]   Now the structure of that digestive tract
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.280]   turns out to be very important
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.260]   in terms of gut brain signaling.
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.060]   Once again, it's a tube and the hollow of that tube
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.180]   is called the lumen, L-U-M-E-N.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.440]   But the walls of the tube are not necessarily smooth,
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   at least not for significant portions
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.120]   of the digestive tract.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.000]   For much of the digestive tract,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.780]   there are bumps and grooves that look very much
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.100]   like the folds in the brain,
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.960]   but these bumps and grooves are made up of other tissues.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.940]   They're made up of what's called a mucosal lining.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.080]   So there's a lot of mucus there.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.360]   And if we were to look really closely,
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.520]   what we'd find is that there are little hairy
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.040]   like cellular processes that we call microvilli
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.620]   that are able to push things along the digestive tract.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:38.120]   The microbiota reside everywhere along the lumen
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.160]   of the digestive tract, starting at the mouth
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.000]   and all the way to the other end.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.840]   And they reside within those microvilli
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.080]   and they reside within the lumen.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.080]   And if we were to look really closely
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.280]   at the bumps and grooves along the digestive tract,
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.960]   what we would find is that there are little niches,
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.880]   little areas in which particular things
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.400]   can grow and reside best.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.640]   Now that might sound kind of gross,
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.300]   but it actually is a good thing,
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.040]   especially if what's growing and residing there
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.500]   are microbacterial organisms that are good for your gut
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.240]   and that signal good things to your brain.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.400]   And we will talk about what that signaling looks like
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.200]   and how that's done and accomplished in just a few moments.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.280]   But I want you to get a clear mental picture of your gut,
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.960]   something that we don't often see.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.540]   And often when we think about the gut,
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.760]   again, we just think about the hollow of the stomach,
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.780]   food going in there and getting digested,
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.100]   but it's far more complex
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.120]   and actually far more interesting than that.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.340]   Now I've been referring to the gut microbiome
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.280]   and to the microbiota and these bacteria.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.760]   Let me define those terms a little bit more specifically
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.620]   just to avoid any confusion.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.900]   The microbiota are the actual bacteria.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.140]   The microbiome is used to refer to the bacteria,
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.800]   but also all the genes that those bacteria make,
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.680]   because it turns out that they make some important genes
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.600]   that actually impact all of us.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.840]   You have loads and loads of these little microbiota,
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.360]   these bacteria.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.020]   In fact, right now you are carrying with you
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.160]   about two to three kilograms.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.760]   So that's more than six pounds of these microbiota,
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.080]   these bacteria.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.880]   And if we were to look at them under a microscope,
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.480]   what we would see is these are relatively simple
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.820]   little organisms, some remain stationary.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.920]   So they might plop down into the mucosal lining,
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.400]   or they might hang out on a particular microvilli,
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.120]   or they might be in one of those little niches
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.120]   and others can move about.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.960]   But they basically fill the entire lumen,
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.300]   they surround and kind of coat the surface of the microvilli,
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.660]   and they're tucked up into any of those little niches
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.180]   that are available to them to tuck into.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.820]   If you were to take the head of a pin
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.160]   and look at it under the microscope,
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.220]   you could fit many, many hundreds, if not thousands or more
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.460]   of these little microbacteria.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.400]   And the reason I say many, many thousands or more,
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.260]   I'm giving a kind of broad range there,
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.080]   is that they do vary in size.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.820]   And again, they vary as to whether or not they can move
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.580]   or they don't move.
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.060]   Now, they're constantly turning over in your gut,
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.620]   meaning they're being born, so to speak,
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.640]   and they're dying off.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.640]   And some will stay there for very long periods of time
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.100]   within your gut and others will get excreted.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.920]   About 60% of your stool,
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.480]   as unpleasant as that might be to think about,
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.700]   is made up of live and dead microbacteria.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.180]   So you're constantly making
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.220]   and excreting these microbacteria.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.300]   And which microbacteria you make
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.660]   and how many stay inside your gut and how many leave,
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.180]   meaning how many are excreted,
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.300]   depends a lot on the chemistry of your gut
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.720]   and depends very strongly on the foods that you eat
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.900]   and the foods that you do not eat.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.340]   Now, just because what we eat
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.020]   strongly influences our microbiome,
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.940]   meaning our microbacteria,
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.460]   does not mean that there are not other influences
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.860]   on what constitutes our microbiome.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.420]   Our microbiome is also made up by microbacteria
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.980]   that access our digestive tract through our mouth,
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.800]   through breathing, through kissing,
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.080]   and through skin contact.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.660]   In fact, one of the major determinants of our microbiome
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.620]   is who we interact with
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.020]   and the environment that we happen to be in.
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.180]   And that actually includes
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.800]   whether or not we interact with animals.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.140]   In a little bit, I'll talk about some data
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.300]   as to whether or not you grew up in a home that had animals,
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.480]   whether or not you grew up in the home,
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.360]   whether or not there was a lot of social contact,
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.040]   meaning skin contact,
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.380]   or whether or not you grew up
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.580]   in a more animal-sparse, contact-sparse environment
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.760]   and how that shapes your microbiome.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.320]   But the simple point is
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.660]   that what you eat influences your microbiome,
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.360]   but also what you do, what you think, and what you feel,
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.100]   and many of the little microbacteria
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.420]   that get into your digestive tract
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.920]   do so by way of social interactions.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.520]   In fact, if you ask a neurobiologist
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.620]   what the role of the microbiome is,
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.940]   they'll tell you almost certainly
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.220]   that it's there to impact brain function.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.420]   But if you have friends that are microbiologists,
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.640]   such as I do, they'll tell you,
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.460]   well, maybe the brain and nervous system
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.000]   are there to support the microbiome.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.560]   It's the other way around.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.060]   You have all these little microorganisms
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.760]   that are taking residence in our body.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.420]   They don't really know what they're doing as far as we know.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.420]   We don't know that they have a consciousness or they don't.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.800]   We can't rule that out, but it seems pretty unlikely.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.320]   Nonetheless, they are taking advantage
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.760]   of the different environments all along your digestive tract.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.600]   They are taking advantage
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.780]   of the sorts of social interactions.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.220]   For instance, the people you talk to and that breathe on you,
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.980]   the people that you shake hands with,
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.120]   the people that you kiss or don't kiss,
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:50.960]   the people that you happen
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.840]   to be romantically involved with or not,
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.880]   your dog, your cat, your lizard, your rat,
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.080]   whatever pet you happen to own is impacting your microbiome.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.060]   There's absolutely no question about that.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.560]   So hopefully now you have some sense
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.320]   of the architecture of the digestive pathway
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.220]   and you have some sense of the trillions
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.440]   of little microbacteria that are living
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.320]   all along the different components of that digestive pathway.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.920]   But what we haven't talked about yet
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.600]   and what I'd like to talk about now
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.240]   is what those little microbiota are actually doing
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.120]   in your digestive tract.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.300]   In addition to just living there
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.320]   for their own intents and purposes,
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.480]   they are contributing, for instance, to your digestion.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.820]   Many of the genes that those microbiota make
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.300]   are genes that are involved in fermentation
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.560]   and genes that are involved in digestion
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.000]   of particular types of nutrients.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.920]   And in a little bit, we will talk about
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.120]   how what you eat can actually change the enzymes
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.080]   that those microbiome components make.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.720]   Enzymes largely being things
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   that are responsible for digestion.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.780]   They catalyze other sorts of cellular events,
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.880]   but in the context of the digestive pathway,
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.280]   we're talking about enzymes that help digest your food.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.760]   So those microbiota are indeed helping you in many ways.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.100]   And if you lack certain microbiota that can help you digest,
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.920]   it stands to reason that you would have challenges
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.960]   digesting certain types of foods.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.480]   The other amazing thing that these microbiota do
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.680]   is they change the way that your brain functions
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.840]   by way of metabolizing or facilitating the metabolism
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.200]   of particular neurotransmitters.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.400]   So one of the ways that having certain microbiota
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.200]   present in your gut can improve your mood
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.080]   or degrade your mood, for instance,
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:36.080]   is by way of certain microbiota being converted into
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.980]   or facilitating the conversion of chemicals such as GABA.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.520]   GABA is what we call an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.860]   It's involved in suppressing the action of other neurons.
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.780]   And that might sound like a bad thing,
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.960]   but all types of sedatives, for instance,
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.840]   alcohol and a lot of neurons that naturally make GABA
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.740]   can help quiet certain circuits in the brain.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.240]   For instance, circuits responsible for anxiety.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.240]   In people who have epilepsy,
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.760]   the GABAergic neurons, as they're called,
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.520]   can often be disrupted in their signaling,
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.600]   meaning they're not cranking out as much GABA,
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.120]   and therefore the excitatory neurons,
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.880]   which typically release other molecules like glutamate,
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.940]   can engage in what's called runaway excitation,
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.960]   and that can give rise to seizures.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.420]   So the simple message here is that the microbiota,
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.840]   by way of making neurochemicals,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.300]   can influence the way that your brain functions.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.000]   So you want to support those microbiota,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.780]   and we will give you tools to support those microbiota.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.600]   But the takeaway at this point is that those microbiota
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.440]   are making things locally to help digest food.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.060]   Other microbiota are helping to make
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.980]   certain neurotransmitters like GABA,
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.540]   and we'll also talk about dopamine and serotonin.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.800]   And so the very specific microbiota that reside in your gut
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.660]   have a profound influence on many, many biological functions,
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.060]   especially immune system function,
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.640]   brain function, and digestion.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.860]   So that should give you a fairly complete picture
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.260]   of your gut microbiome.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.660]   Now I'd like to talk about how your microbiome
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.420]   and your brain communicate,
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.280]   or more accurately, how your microbiome
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.880]   and the rest of your nervous system communicate.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.600]   Neurons, which simply means nerve cells,
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.340]   are the cells that do most of the heavy lifting
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.280]   in your nervous system.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.380]   There are, of course, other cell types that are important.
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.340]   Glial cells, for instance, very, very important cell types.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.700]   You have endothelial cells,
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.380]   which are responsible for blood flow,
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.700]   pericytes and other types of cells.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.640]   But the neurons are really doing most of the heavy lifting
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.380]   for most of the things we think about
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.300]   in terms of nervous system function.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.180]   You have neurons in your gut,
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.080]   and that should not surprise you.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.900]   Neurons reside in your brain, your spinal cord, your eyes,
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.720]   in fact, all over your body,
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.020]   and you've got them in your heart,
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.300]   and you've got them in your lungs,
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.220]   and you've got them in your spleen,
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.620]   and they connect to all the different organs
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.780]   and tissues of your body.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.500]   So that's not surprising that you have neurons in your gut.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.180]   What is surprising, however,
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.940]   is the presence of particular types of neurons
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.880]   that reside near or in the mucosal lining
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.740]   just next to that lumen of the gut,
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.820]   and that are paying attention,
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.780]   and I'll explain what I mean by paying attention,
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.080]   to the components of the gut,
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.700]   both the nutrients and the microbiota,
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:31.180]   and thereby can send signals up to the brain
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.740]   by way of a long wire that we call an axon,
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:39.680]   and can communicate what the chemistry
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.100]   and what the nutritional quality
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.040]   and what the other aspects of the environment
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.620]   are at the gut at a given location up to the brain
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.920]   in ways that can influence the brain to, for instance,
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.600]   seek out more of a particular food.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.460]   Let me give you a sort of action-based picture of this.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.220]   Let's say, like most people, you enjoy sweet foods.
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.840]   I don't particularly enjoy sweet foods,
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.900]   but there are a few that I like.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.460]   I'm a sucker for a really good dark chocolate,
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.300]   or really good ice cream,
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.820]   or I got this thing for donuts that seems to just not quit,
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.340]   although I don't tend to indulge it very often.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.180]   I do like them.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.980]   If I eat that particular food,
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.420]   obviously digestion starts in the mouth,
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.020]   there are enzymes there, it gets chewed up,
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.620]   the food goes down into the gut.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:27.240]   These neurons are activated,
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.800]   meaning that causes the neurons to be electrically active
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.440]   when particular components,
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.340]   certain nutrients in those foods are present.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.100]   And for the cell types,
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.540]   or I should say the neuron types that matter here,
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.420]   the nutrients that really trigger their activation
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.280]   are sugar, fatty acids, and amino acids.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.300]   Now, these particular neurons
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.160]   have the name enteroendocrine cells,
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.220]   but more recently they've been defined as neuropod cells.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.580]   Neuropod cells were discovered
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.240]   by Diego Bohorquez's lab at Duke University.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.860]   This is a phenomenal set of discoveries
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.340]   made mostly in the last 10 years.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.740]   These neuropod cells, as I mentioned,
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.540]   are activated by sugar, fatty acids, or amino acids,
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:17.380]   but have a particularly strong activation to sugars.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.380]   They do seem to be part of the sweet sensing system.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.940]   And even though I'm focusing on this particular example,
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.700]   they represent a really nice example
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.380]   of how a particular set of nerve cells in our gut
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.860]   is collecting information about what is there
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.420]   at a particular location in the gut
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.020]   and sending that information up to our brain.
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.220]   Now, they do that by way of a nerve pathway
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.900]   called the vagus nerve.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.220]   The vagus nerve is part of the peripheral nervous system,
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.380]   and the vagus nerve is a little bit complex to describe
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.220]   if you're just listening to this.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.460]   If you're watching this,
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.580]   I'll try and use my hands as a diagram,
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.300]   but really the best thing to do
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.620]   if you really want to learn neuroanatomy
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.040]   is to just imagine it in your mind as best you can,
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.840]   and if you can track down a picture of it, terrific.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.800]   But here's how it works.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.100]   Neurons have a cell body that we call a soma.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.420]   That's where all the DNA are contained.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.740]   That's where a lot of the operating machinery
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.300]   of the cells are contained,
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.300]   and a lot of the instructions for that cell
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.320]   of what to be and how to operate are contained.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.060]   The cell bodies of these neurons or the relevant neurons
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.060]   are actually up near the neck.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.300]   So you can think of them as kind of a clump of grapes
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.340]   'cause cell bodies tend to be round or ovalish.
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.800]   And then they send a process that we call an axon
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.420]   in one direction out to the gut,
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.500]   and they'll send another process up into the brain.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.780]   And that little cluster near the neck that's relevant here
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.340]   is called the nodos ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.140]   The nodos ganglion is a little cluster of neurons
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.840]   on either side of the neck.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.500]   It has a process that goes out to the gut
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.680]   and a process that goes up into the brain.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.800]   And again, these are just one component
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.320]   of the so-called vagus nerve.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.740]   The vagus nerve has many, many branches,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.820]   not just to the gut.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.360]   There are also branches to the liver,
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.060]   branches to the lungs, branches to the heart,
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.960]   branches to the larynx, and even to the spleen
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.860]   and other areas of the body that are important.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.680]   But right now, we're just concentrating on the neurons
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.200]   that are in the gut that signal up to the brain.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.540]   And what the Bohorkas lab has shown
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.720]   is that these neuropod cells are part of this network.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.280]   They're sensing several different nutrients,
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.300]   but in particular, when they send sugar,
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.160]   they send signals in the form of electrical firing
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.100]   up to the brain in ways that trigger activation
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.500]   of other brain stations that cause you to seek out
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.300]   more of that particular food.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.580]   Now, this brings us to some classic experiments
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.420]   that at least to me are incredible.
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.740]   And these are highly reproducible findings
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.900]   showing for instance, that even if you bypass taste
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.900]   by infusing sweet liquid or putting sweet foods into the gut
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.460]   and people can never taste them with their mouth,
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.780]   people will seek out more of that particular food.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.780]   And if you give them the option to have a sweet food infused
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:16.840]   into their gut or a bitter food infused into their gut
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.080]   or a sweet versus sour or a more sweet
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.140]   versus less sweet food, people have a selective preference
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.300]   for sweet foods, even if they can't taste them.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.860]   Now, this is important to understand
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.420]   in the context of gut brain signaling,
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.040]   because we always think that we like sweet foods
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.740]   because of the way they taste.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.100]   And indeed that's still true,
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.660]   but much of what we consider the great taste
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.740]   of a sweet food also has to do with a gut sensation
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.340]   that is below our conscious detection.
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.480]   How do we know that?
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.000]   Well, the Bohorquez lab has performed experiments
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.260]   using modern methods and their classic experiments
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.920]   showing that animals and humans will actively seek out
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   more of a particular sweet food,
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.740]   even if it bypasses this taste system.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.020]   And the reverse is also true.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.240]   There have been experiments done in animals and in humans
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.820]   that have allowed animals or humans to select
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.940]   and eat sweet foods, and indeed that's what they do
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.340]   if they're given the option.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:20.680]   And yet to somehow eliminate the activation of these neurons
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.660]   within the gut that can sense sweet foods.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.700]   Now, there are a couple of different ways
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.200]   that those experiments have been done.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.420]   In classic experiments that date back to the '80s,
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.460]   this was done by what's called subdiaphragmatic vagotomy.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.660]   So this means cutting off the branch of the vagus
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.140]   that innervates the gut below the diaphragm
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.920]   so that the other organs can still function
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.620]   because the vagus is very important.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.420]   But basically cutting off the sweet sensing in the gut,
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.860]   still giving people the opportunity
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.340]   to taste sweet foods with their mouth,
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.460]   and they don't actively seek out
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.500]   quite as much of the sweet food
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.780]   when they don't have this gut sensing mechanism
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.960]   that we now know to be dependent on these neuropod cells.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.540]   More recent experiments involve selective silencing
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.140]   of these neuropod cells,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.900]   and there've been a lot of different derivations
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:03.900]   of this sort of thing.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.000]   But the takeaway from it is that our experience of,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.020]   and our desire for particular foods
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.480]   has everything to do with how those foods taste.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.460]   It also has to do, as you probably know, with their texture
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.220]   and the sensation of those foods in our mouth,
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.660]   and even indeed how they go down our throat
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.160]   sometimes can be very pleasing or very unpleasant.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.180]   And it also has to do with the subconscious processing
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.860]   of taste that occurs in the gut itself.
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.020]   And again, when I say gut,
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.460]   I don't just mean in the stomach.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.260]   There are actually neurons, neuropod cells
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.020]   further down your digestive tract,
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.860]   which are signaling to your brain
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.420]   about the presence of sweet foods,
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.060]   as well as foods such as amino acid rich foods
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.400]   or foods that are rich in particular types of fatty acids,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.780]   signaling up to your brain
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.820]   and causing you to seek out more of those foods
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.180]   or to consume more of those foods.
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.300]   Now you're probably asking, what is the signal?
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.900]   How does it actually make me want more of those foods
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.300]   without me realizing it?
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.340]   Well, it does that by adjusting the release
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.780]   of particular neuromodulators.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.420]   For those of you that are not familiar
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.740]   with neuromodulators, these are similar to neurotransmitters,
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.760]   but they tend to act more broadly.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.220]   They tend to impact many more neurons all at once.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.980]   And they go by names like dopamine, serotonin,
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.620]   acetylcholine, epinephrine, and so forth.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.020]   Sometimes people refer to those as neurotransmitters.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.860]   Technically they are neuromodulators.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.820]   I'll refer to them almost always as neuromodulators.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.500]   The neuropod cells signal by way
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.860]   of a particular branch of the vagus
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.940]   through the nodose ganglion that we talked about before,
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.740]   and through a number of different stations
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.420]   in the brainstem, eventually cause the release
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.740]   of the neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.020]   Dopamine is often associated with a sense of pleasure
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:52.260]   and reward, but it is more appropriately thought of
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.740]   as a neuromodulator that impacts motivation,
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:55.820]   craving, and pursuit.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.820]   It tends to put us into modes of action,
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.580]   not necessarily running and moving through space,
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.980]   although it can do that too.
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.340]   But in the context of feeding,
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:07.900]   it tends to make us look around more, chew more,
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.940]   reach for things more, and seek out more
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.020]   of whatever it is that's giving us that sensation
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.720]   of delight or satisfaction.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.580]   And again, that sense of delight and satisfaction,
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.960]   you might experience only consciously
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.280]   as the way that something tastes on your mouth,
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.200]   but it actually is caused, again,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.800]   by both the sensations in your mouth,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.080]   but also by the activation of these neuropod cells.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.120]   So this is an incredible system of gut-brain signaling,
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.700]   and it is but one system of gut-brain signaling.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.740]   It turns out it's the system that we know the most about
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.120]   at this point in time.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.140]   There are other components of gut-brain signaling
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.320]   that we'll talk about in a moment.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.860]   For instance, the serotonin system.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.440]   But in terms of examples of gut-brain signaling,
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.800]   for which we know a lot of the individual elements
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.960]   and how they work, I think this neuropod neuron sensing
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.400]   of sweet foods, fatty acids, and amino acids in the gut,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.320]   and communicating that up to the brain by way of the vagus
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.380]   and causing us to seek out more of the foods
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.840]   that deliver those nutrients is an incredible pathway
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.640]   that really delineates the beauty
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.260]   and the power of this gut-brain axis.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.560]   Let me talk about timescales.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.240]   Here, I'm talking about a particular type of neuron
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.920]   that is signaling up to the brain using electrical signals
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.040]   to cause us to want to seek out
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.340]   a particular category of foods.
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.760]   That's happening relatively fast
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.040]   compared to the hormone pathways of the gut,
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.600]   which also involve neurons.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.080]   So your gut is also communicating to your brain
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.900]   by way of neurons, nerve cells.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.920]   But some of those nerve cells also release hormones,
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.280]   and those hormones go by names like CCK,
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.780]   glucagon-like peptide-1, PYY, et cetera.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.680]   A good example of a hormone pathway,
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.420]   or what sometimes is called a hormone peptide pathway
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.180]   that is similar to the pathway I've talked about before,
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.740]   but a little bit slower is the ghrelin pathway.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:06.740]   Ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N, increases with fasting.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.100]   So the longer it's been since you've eaten,
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.200]   or if you're just eating very little food
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.020]   compared to your caloric needs,
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.360]   ghrelin levels are going to go up in your bloodstream,
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.720]   and they go up because of processes
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.140]   that include processes within the gut
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.900]   and include the nervous system.
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.820]   So it's a slow pathway driving you
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.060]   to seek out food generally.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.080]   As far as we know, the ghrelin system is not partial
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.220]   to seeking out of sweet foods or fatty foods or so on.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:38.520]   Ghrelin increases the longer it's been
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.560]   since you've eaten sufficient calories,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.140]   and it stimulates a feeling of you wanting to seek out food.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.000]   Well, how does it do that?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.280]   It does that again by impacting neural circuits
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.300]   within the brain,
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.700]   neural circuits that include
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.860]   what we call the brainstem autonomic centers.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.860]   So it tends to make you feel alert
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.480]   and quite, we say high levels of autonomic arousal.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.940]   If you haven't eaten in a while,
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.160]   you might think that you just get really exhausted, right?
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.860]   Because we all hear that food is energy
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.940]   and caloric energy is what we need to burn,
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.360]   but you actually have a lot of energy stored in your body
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.820]   that you would be able to use if you really needed energy.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.340]   But typically we haven't eaten in a while,
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.860]   we start to get agitated,
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.300]   and we get agitated by way of release of
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.020]   the neuromodulator epinephrine,
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.140]   which causes us to look around more,
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.080]   move around more and seek out food.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.520]   That all occurs in brainstem autonomic centers
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.540]   and in the hypothalamus.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.920]   We did an entire episode on feeding behavior
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.640]   and metabolism as well,
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.740]   and you can find those episodes at hubermanlab.com.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.400]   So I don't want to go into a lot of detail
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.660]   about hypothalamic and brainstem centers,
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.760]   but there's a particular area of the brain
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.220]   called the nucleus of the solitary tract,
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.140]   the NST as it's called,
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.220]   that's very strongly impacted by these circulating hormones
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.700]   and tends to drive us toward feeding behavior.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.900]   So the important point here is that we have a fast system
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.060]   that is paying attention to the nutrients in our gut
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.700]   or the absence of nutrients in our gut
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.560]   and stimulating us to seek out food
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.300]   or to stop eating certain foods.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.660]   And we have a slower hormone related system
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.500]   that also originates in the gut and impacts the brain.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:12.320]   But all of those converge on neural circuits for feeding.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.480]   The neural circuits for feeding
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.940]   include things like the arcuate nucleus,
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.260]   the hypothalamus, they include
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.020]   a bunch of other neurochemicals.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.380]   But the point is that you've got a fast route
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:25.020]   and a slow route to drive you to eat more or eat less,
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.820]   to seek out food and consume it,
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.900]   or to stop eating and to essentially kickstart
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.680]   the satiety mechanisms as they're called.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.780]   And those are operating in parallel.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.020]   It's not like one happens first, then stops, then the other.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.620]   They're always operating in parallel.
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.020]   And I bring this up because there's a bigger theme here,
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.260]   which we see over and over again in biology,
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.140]   which is the concept of parallel pathways.
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.340]   You've always got multiple accelerators
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.660]   and multiple breaks on a system.
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.180]   It's very, very rare to have just one accelerator
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.580]   and one break on the system.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.900]   And this will become important later
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.260]   when we talk about tools for optimizing your gut microbiome
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.500]   for healthy eating and for healthy digestion
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.020]   and for healthy brain function.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:02.860]   I want to take a moment
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.820]   and talk about glucagon-like peptide one,
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.980]   which is also called GLP-1.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:13.780]   GLP-1 is made by neurons in the gut
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.060]   and by neurons in the brain.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.860]   This is a fairly recent discovery,
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.260]   but it's an important one.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:25.260]   GLP-1 tends to inhibit feeding and tends to reduce appetite.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:31.800]   There are a number of drugs released on the market now.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.760]   One, for instance, goes by the name semaglutide,
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.220]   which is essentially an GLP-1 agonist.
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.380]   It causes the release of more GLP-1.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.560]   It's being used to treat type two diabetes,
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.380]   which is insulin resistant diabetes.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.320]   This is different than type one diabetes
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.740]   where people don't actually make insulin.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:53.740]   It's also being used as a drug to reduce obesity.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.580]   And it seems pretty effective,
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.900]   at least in certain populations.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.180]   There are certain foods and substances that increase GLP-1.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.280]   I've talked about a few of these on the podcast.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.000]   One that I'm a particular fan of for entirely other reasons
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.580]   is yerba mate tea can stimulate the release of GLP-1.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:13.240]   In South America, it's often used as an appetite suppressant,
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.360]   probably in large part
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.760]   because of its effects on GLP-1 release,
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.380]   but probably also because it does contain caffeine,
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.480]   which is a bit of a stimulant,
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.300]   which also can be involved in lipolysis,
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.400]   which is the utilization of fat stores for energy
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.240]   and so forth.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.900]   A brief mention about yerba mate.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.860]   There are some reports out there
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.240]   that yerba mate can increase certain types of cancers.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.960]   The data that I've seen on this
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.160]   is that it tends to relate
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.580]   to whether or not those are smoked versions
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.020]   of the yerba mate tea,
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.680]   the amount of consumption and the debate is still out.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.320]   So I invite you to look at those papers.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.020]   You can search for those online.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:55.160]   Nonetheless, yerba mate is one source of GLP-1 stimulation.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.700]   Semaglutide is another source.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.740]   It also can be stimulated by various foods,
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.880]   nuts, avocados, eggs, and so forth.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:06.680]   Certain high fiber complex grains will also stimulate GLP-1.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.920]   I raised this as not necessarily a route
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.680]   that you want to take in order to reduce food intake.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.520]   I don't even know that that's your goal,
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.100]   but that GLP-1 is another one of these gut
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.160]   to brain signaling mechanisms that adjusts appetite
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.520]   that is dependent on diet,
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.760]   depends on what you eat or drink,
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.620]   and that the GLP-1 pathway does seem particularly sensitive
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.640]   to the constituents of diet.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.160]   There's at least one quality study I was able to find
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.480]   showing that the ketogenic diet, for instance,
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.360]   which almost always involves ingestion
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.100]   of very low levels of carbohydrate, can increase GLP-1.
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.220]   Although, as I mentioned before,
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.000]   there are other foods that fall outside the range
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.320]   of what we would consider ketogenic
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.880]   that can also stimulate GLP-1.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.480]   And as I mentioned, there are prescription drugs
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.960]   like semaglutide.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.480]   There are other ones as well now that stimulate GLP-1.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.440]   So how does GLP-1 reduce appetite?
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.720]   It does that in part by changing the activity of neurons
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.900]   in the hypothalamus, this cluster of neurons,
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.880]   just above the roof of our mouth,
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.700]   that themselves make GLP-1,
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.880]   and that cause the activation of motor circuits
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.560]   for reaching, chewing, all the things that we associate
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.040]   with feeding behavior.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.340]   So I use GLP-1 as an example of a pathway
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.660]   that you might choose to tap into by ingestion
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.180]   of yerba mate or by ingestion of the foods I mentioned,
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.040]   or if it's something that interests you, ketogenic diet.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.060]   But I also mention it simply
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.620]   because it's another beautiful example
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.400]   of how a hormone pathway can impact the activity
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.560]   of brain circuits that are directly involved
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.360]   in a particular behavior.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.540]   So yet another example of how gut is communicating to brain
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.400]   in order to change what we think we want
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.040]   or to change what our actual behaviors are.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.400]   So the next time you find yourself reaching for food
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.400]   or you find yourself wanting a particular sweet thing
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.120]   or fatty thing or something that contains
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.620]   a lot of amino acids, a protein-rich food,
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.400]   keep in mind that that's not just about
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.600]   the taste of the food.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.640]   And it's not even necessarily about the nutrients
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.360]   that you need or don't need.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.480]   It could be, but it's also about the subconscious signaling
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.360]   that's coming from your body all the time.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.480]   Waves of hormones, waves of nerve cell signals,
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.360]   electrical signals that are changing
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.600]   the way that your brain works.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.080]   And this raises for me a memory of the episode
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.800]   that I did with Dr. Robert Sapolsky,
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.500]   who's a world expert colleague of mine at Stanford,
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.200]   who is expert on things like hormones and behavior.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.320]   But we got into the topic of free will,
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.480]   which is a bit of a barbed wire topic.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.680]   As many of you know, it gets into the realm of philosophy,
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.520]   et cetera.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.240]   And we were kind of batting back and forth the idea.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.920]   I was saying, well, I think there's free will
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.720]   and can't there certainly be free will
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.960]   or certainly the idea that we can avoid certain choices.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.900]   And Robert was saying, no.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.920]   In fact, he said, nah.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.800]   He doesn't believe that we have any free will.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.000]   He thinks that events in our brain are determined
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.780]   by biological events that are below our conscious detection
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.060]   and that occur seconds to milliseconds
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.240]   before we make decisions or assessments.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.500]   And therefore we just can't control what we do,
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.340]   what we think and what we feel.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.020]   And at the time I sort of didn't buy it.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.460]   I thought, I don't know.
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.240]   I just, I guess I really wanted to believe in free will.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.000]   And to some extent I still do.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.580]   But as we talk about how these neurons in our gut
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.600]   and these hormones in our gut are influencing our brain
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.300]   and the decisions that we are making
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.660]   at the level of circuits like the hypothalamus
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.540]   and the nucleus of the solitary tract,
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:39.620]   these are areas of the brain way below our frontal cortex
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.160]   and our conscious perception.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.700]   I think these are examples that really fall in favor
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.900]   of what Dr. Sapolsky was arguing,
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.620]   which is that events that are happening within our body
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.140]   are actually changing the way our brain works.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.220]   So we might think that we want the cupcake.
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:56.780]   We might think that we don't need to eat something
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.120]   or do need to eat something.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.660]   And that is entirely on the basis of prior knowledge
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.020]   and decision-making that we're making with our head.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:07.020]   But in fact, it's very clear to me based on the work
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.860]   from the Bohork's lab, classic work over the years
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.180]   dating back to the '80s and indeed back to the '50s
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.680]   that we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.380]   that our body is shaping the decisions
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.580]   that our brain is making and we're not aware of it at all.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.460]   Now, the good news is that whether or not
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.180]   you believe in free will or not,
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.300]   the simple knowledge that this whole process is happening
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:27.880]   can perhaps be a benefit to you.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.060]   You can perhaps leverage it to get some insight
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.820]   and understanding and perhaps even a wedge
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.660]   into your own behavior.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.140]   You might think, ah, I think I want that particular food
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.500]   or I think I want to avoid that particular food,
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.460]   but actually that's not a decision that I'm making
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.160]   on a purely rational basis.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.980]   It has a lot to do with what my gut is telling my brain.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.120]   So we've largely been talking about chemical communication
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.740]   between the gut and the brain.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.580]   Chemical because even though these neuropod cells
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.000]   are communicating with the brain
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.040]   by way of electrical activity,
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.300]   what we call action potentials and in neural language,
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.960]   we call those spikes, spikes of action potentials.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:10.600]   Spikes of action potentials, meaning those neural signals,
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.160]   cause the release of chemicals in the brain like dopamine.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.960]   So it's chemical transmission.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.380]   Similarly, hormones, even though they act more slowly,
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:25.960]   hormones like neuropeptide Y, like CCK, like ghrelin,
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.020]   they are signaling chemically.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.100]   They're moving through the body.
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:32.940]   They're going in there affecting the chemical output
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.140]   of different cells.
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.140]   And they're changing the chemistry of those cells
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.620]   and the chemistry of the cells that those cells talk to.
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.580]   So that gives us one particular category of signaling
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.900]   from gut to brain, which is chemical signaling.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.520]   But of course there are other forms of signals
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.500]   and those fall under the category of mechanical signaling.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.840]   You're probably familiar with this.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.800]   If you've ever eaten a very large meal
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.700]   or consumed a lot of fluid,
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.200]   you experience that as distension of the gut.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.320]   And that doesn't just have to be distension of the stomach,
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.080]   but distension of your intestines as well.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.260]   That distension is registered by neurons
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.880]   that reside in your gut.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.200]   The signals go up to your brain
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.780]   and communicate with areas of the brain
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.780]   that are responsible for suppressing further consumption
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.700]   of food and or fluid.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.540]   And under certain circumstances can also be associated
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.860]   with the activation of neural circuits
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.020]   that cause vomiting or the desire to vomit.
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.040]   So if ever you've eaten too much
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.260]   or you've eaten something that doesn't agree with you,
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.940]   that information is communicated by way of mechanosensors
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.160]   that sense the mechanics of your gut,
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.880]   possibly also the chemistry of your gut,
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.500]   but mostly the mechanics of your gut signal up to the brain
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.600]   and activate brain centers that are involved
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.640]   in stopping the eating behavior
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.440]   and activation of an area of the brainstem
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.800]   that is affectionately referred to as the vomit center
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.060]   among neuroanatomists.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.800]   This is a area that more appropriately
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   is called the chemoreceptor trigger zone, the CTZ,
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.000]   or area postrema.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.800]   And neurons in this area actually will trigger
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.780]   the vomiting reflex.
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.100]   So the way that the gut and the brain communicate
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.960]   is both chemical and mechanical,
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.140]   and it can be both for sake of increasing
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.940]   certain types of behavior.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.760]   Today, we're talking mainly about feeding behavior
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:23.120]   up until now anyway, but also ceasing to eat,
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.160]   closing your mouth, moving away from food,
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.820]   turning away from food,
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.260]   all behaviors that we're familiar with
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.240]   anytime we feel kind of sick on the basis of activation
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.500]   of this mechanosensor for gastric distress.
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.340]   So we've got chemical signaling and mechanical signaling.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.980]   And I also want to emphasize
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.820]   that we have direct and indirect,
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.020]   signaling from the gut to the brain.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.220]   Direct signaling is the kind of signaling
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.720]   of the sort I've been talking about mainly up until now,
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.360]   which is neurons in the gut,
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.140]   communicating with neurons in the brainstem
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.360]   that communicate with neurons in the hypothalamus.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.340]   And of course, those are also going to interact
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.460]   with neurons of the prefrontal cortex,
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.540]   which is the area of your brain involved in decision-making.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.220]   The, you know, I think it was the shrimp that made me sick.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.320]   I'm going to, I just don't want any more of that.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.140]   Or I'm never going back to that restaurant again
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.960]   because after I ate there about an hour later,
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.580]   I started feeling really not well.
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:15.940]   I felt, you know, kind of feverish,
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.040]   but my gut didn't feel well.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.100]   My digestion was really off.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.400]   All of that kind of information is handled
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.720]   in the prefrontal cortex at a conscious level,
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.980]   but the immediate decision to stop eating
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.420]   or to eat more of something,
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.780]   to move towards something or away from it,
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:32.200]   that's made by neural circuits that reside at the,
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.140]   we would say the subconscious level.
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.820]   But what we really mean is below the level of the neocortex.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.700]   Below the cortex means essentially below our level
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:40.980]   of conscious awareness.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.660]   So we talked about two types of information within the gut
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:46.540]   that are communicated to the brain, chemical information,
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.380]   meaning information about the nutrients
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:50.420]   that happen to be there and mechanical information,
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.380]   distention of the gut or lack of distention and so forth.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.560]   And we talked about how these neuropod cells
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.420]   can signal the release of dopamine in circuits
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.580]   within the brain to cause you to seek out more of something.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.660]   Now, in a very logically consistent way,
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:08.780]   dopamine is also involved in the whole business of vomiting.
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.360]   You might think, well, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.100]   I thought dopamine was always a good thing.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.780]   It's involved in moderation and reward, et cetera.
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.260]   But turns out the areopostrema, this vomit center
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:20.420]   and the brainstem is chock a block
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.060]   full of dopamine receptors.
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.700]   And if dopamine levels go too high,
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.380]   it can actually trigger vomiting.
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.500]   And this we see in the context of various drugs
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.580]   that are used to treat things like Parkinson's.
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.300]   Parkinson's is a deficiency in dopamine
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.520]   or a lack of dopamine neurons,
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.460]   typically that causes a resting tremor,
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.980]   difficulty in movement because dopamine is also associated
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.140]   with a lot of the neural circuits for movement.
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:47.380]   Many drugs that are used to treat Parkinson's like L-DOPA
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.880]   increase levels of dopamine so much,
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:52.820]   or at least activate dopamine receptors
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.920]   to such a great degree in certain areas of the brain
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.360]   that they can cause activation of things
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.700]   like the trigger to vomit.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.180]   Now, this should also make sense in the natural context
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.000]   of if you gorge yourself with food, gorge yourself with food
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.860]   gorge yourself with food, the neurons in your gut
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.300]   that respond to that are simply detecting
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.500]   the presence of nutrients,
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.340]   but they don't really make decisions themselves.
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.100]   They don't know to stop eating.
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.220]   Your brain knows to stop eating or to eject that food.
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.560]   And so it's a wonderful thing that those neurons
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.580]   are communicating with areas of the brain,
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.880]   not just that stimulate consuming more food,
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.080]   but that are communicating with areas of the brain,
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.740]   for instance, areopostrema,
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.900]   that when dopamine levels get too high
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.800]   cause us to either stop eating that food
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.900]   or in the case of vomiting to eject that food.
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.840]   So I raise this and not to give you a kind of a disgusting
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.000]   counter example to what we call a pettative behaviors,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.080]   the things that we like to do more of,
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.440]   but simply to give you a sense of just how strongly
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.340]   even these reflexes that we think of
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.220]   as feeling sick and vomiting,
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.220]   or the desire to seek out more food
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:03.180]   are really being controlled by a kind of push-pull system,
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.440]   by parallel pathways that are arriving from our gut.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.140]   And the same neurochemicals, in this case, dopamine,
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:12.140]   are being used to create two opposite type behaviors,
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.700]   one behavior to consume more,
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.180]   one behavior to get rid of everything
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.460]   you've already consumed.
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.600]   So our brain is actually sensitive
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.400]   to the amount of signaling coming from our gut,
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.980]   not just the path by which that signal arrives.
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:28.820]   Our brain is very carefully paying attention
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.420]   to whether or not the levels of dopamine
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.860]   that are being triggered are within a normal range
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.220]   for typical eating behavior,
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:35.700]   or whether or not we've gorged ourselves
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.640]   to the point where enough already.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.060]   Now, of course, mechanical signals will also play
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.960]   into areopostrema and into the vomiting reflex.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.260]   If we have a very distended gut, we feel lousy,
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.480]   it actually can hurt very badly,
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.520]   and we will have the desire to vomit,
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.080]   or we will just simply vomit.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.540]   Mechanical and chemical signals
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.340]   are always arriving in parallel.
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.940]   They never work in unison.
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:04.660]   And so now we have chemical signals, mechanical signals,
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:07.580]   and now I'd like to talk about direct and indirect signals,
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.380]   because almost everything I've talked about
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.580]   up until now are direct signals,
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.400]   a neural pathway that converges in the brain
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.920]   to create a particular feeling, thought, or behavior,
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.280]   but there are also indirect pathways,
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.220]   and that's what takes us back to the gut microbiome
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:22.860]   and to these little microbiota.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:26.180]   And to just give you the takeaway message at the front here,
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.380]   and then I'll give you a little more detail
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.620]   as to how it comes about,
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.820]   you have neurotransmitters in your brain
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.540]   and in your spinal cord and in your eyes
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.220]   and in your peripheral nervous system,
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.820]   they cause the activation or the suppression
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.100]   of nerve activity,
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:44.060]   meaning they either electrically activate other nerve cells
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.260]   or they cause other nerve cells
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:46.940]   to be less electrically active,
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.180]   and they do that by way of neurotransmitters.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:53.240]   But as it turns out, the gut microbiota
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.740]   are capable of influencing metabolic events,
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.340]   and in some cases are capable
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.180]   of synthesizing neurotransmitters themselves.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.500]   So what that means is that these little bugs,
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.120]   these little microbiota that are cargo in your gut,
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.740]   the six pounds of cargo,
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.540]   they actually can make neurochemicals
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.440]   that can pass into the bloodstream and into your brain
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.220]   and actually impact the other cells
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.540]   of your body and brain indirectly.
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.080]   So without involving these very intricate nerve pathways
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.700]   that we've been talking about.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.460]   In other words, the foods you eat,
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.740]   the environment of your gut microbiome
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.920]   can actually create the chemical substrates
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.320]   that allow your brain to feel one way or the other,
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.160]   to feel great or to feel lousy,
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.900]   to seek out more of a particular type of behavior
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.320]   or to avoid that behavior.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:38.760]   And that would constitute indirect signaling.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.320]   So I've been talking a lot about the structure and function
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.980]   of the gut to brain pathway,
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.840]   focusing mainly on feeding behaviors,
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:47.900]   and in some cases, avoiding feeding
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:51.020]   or even ejecting food from the digestive tract.
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.760]   I'd like to drill a little bit deeper
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.100]   into this indirect signaling pathway
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.320]   from the gut to the brain,
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.300]   because it bridges us nicely
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.460]   from neuronal signals in the gut to the brain,
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:04.020]   hormonal signals from the gut to the brain,
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.540]   to what also includes the microbiome,
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.020]   which is what we started talking about
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.620]   at the beginning of the episode.
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:12.660]   As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago,
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:16.980]   certain gut microbiota can actually synthesize
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.700]   certain neurotransmitters that can go impact the brain.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.020]   And we actually have some knowledge
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:23.740]   about which microbiota can synthesize
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.220]   particular neurotransmitters.
[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:28.200]   For instance, the neuromodulator dopamine
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   can be synthesized by or from bacillus and serratia.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.260]   Now, these are just names of microbiota.
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.720]   I don't expect that any of you
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.060]   would necessarily recognize them.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:39.960]   These aren't the sorts of things
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.500]   that you necessarily would have run out and buy
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.140]   to get more dopamine.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.200]   But the point is that particular gut microbiota
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.740]   can create dopamine in our gut
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.300]   that can get into our bloodstream
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:55.100]   and can generally change our baseline levels of dopamine,
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.300]   within the brain and other areas of the body.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:00.020]   I mentioned baseline levels of dopamine
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.500]   because as I talked about on an episode all about dopamine,
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:07.140]   but I'll just repeat the basics here now,
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.860]   we have baseline levels of neurotransmitters
[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:11.740]   or neuromodulators that act as sort of
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:14.900]   the level of the tide, the overall level.
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.860]   And then we can have peaks of dopamine
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.100]   that are created by behaviors or by ingestion
[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:21.660]   of particular foods or drugs, et cetera.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:25.380]   So bacillus and serratia tend to increase
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.100]   our baseline levels of dopamine.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.860]   So if it turns out that we are creating
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.760]   the right gut microbiome environment
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.980]   that these particular gut microbiota can thrive in,
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.340]   well then our baseline levels of dopamine will be elevated.
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.840]   And in general, that leads to enhancement of mood.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:48.600]   Similarly, there are other gut microbiota,
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:53.240]   for instance, candida, streptococcus, various enterococcus.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.940]   These always have these kind of strange
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.540]   and not so attractive names,
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:58.420]   at least to me as a neurobiologist.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.820]   Nonetheless, those particular microbiota
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:04.120]   support the production of,
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.640]   or can even be metabolized into serotonin,
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.760]   which is a neuromodulator associated with mood,
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.980]   with social interactions,
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.960]   with a huge number of different types
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.780]   of events and behaviors.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:20.200]   Again, these gut microbiota, when present
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.980]   and allowed to thrive in our gut,
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:25.640]   will increase our overall levels of serotonin.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:28.980]   And riding on top of that level of serotonin
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.700]   will be the serotonin that's specifically released
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.640]   in response to certain behaviors.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.940]   And I really want to drive home this point
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:37.700]   of baselines and peaks.
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:40.740]   The baseline level of serotonin might set our overall mood,
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.260]   whether or not we wake up feeling pretty good
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.760]   or really lousy if our serotonin levels
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.380]   happen to be very, very low.
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.100]   Whether or not we tend to be in a kind of a calm space
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.500]   or whether or not we tend to be somewhat irritable.
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.900]   But then of course, individual events,
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.060]   as we go about our day,
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.440]   maybe a compliment that we get,
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.880]   or maybe somebody says something irritating to us,
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:00.900]   whatever it may be,
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:02.880]   will also influence levels of serotonin.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.460]   But those serotonin events are going to be related to events
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.860]   at particular neural circuits in the brain.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.480]   And this is an important topic
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.180]   because I think that a lot of people here
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:16.960]   quite accurately, oh, 90 to 95% of our serotonin
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.420]   is manufactured in the gut.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:19.280]   And indeed that's true.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.760]   It's manufactured from the sorts of microbiota
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.680]   that I just described.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:25.140]   And there are many, many experiments now,
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.280]   mostly in animal models,
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:28.760]   but also some in humans that show
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.740]   that if the gut microbiome is deficient in some way
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.880]   to these particular bacteria,
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:37.420]   that serotonin levels drop and people's mood suffers,
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.460]   maybe even their immune system functions,
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.380]   maybe even exacerbates certain psychiatric illnesses.
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:45.620]   However, a lot of people take that to mean
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:50.100]   that the serotonin of the brain all comes from the gut
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:51.560]   or mostly comes from the gut.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.400]   That's not the case.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.820]   It's still the case that you have neurons in the brain
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:57.220]   that are responsible for releasing their serotonin
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.160]   directly in response to certain things like social touch
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.100]   or through other types of positive social experiences.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.540]   So we've got gut microbiota
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.060]   that can literally be turned into dopamine
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.800]   and raise our baseline levels of dopamine.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.980]   We've got gut microbiota
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:16.360]   that can literally raise our baseline levels of serotonin.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.380]   And indeed, there are other gut microbiota
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:23.380]   like lactobacillus or bifidobacterium,
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.020]   hard complex names to pronounce,
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.020]   bifidobacterium that can give rise
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.880]   to increases in GABA levels,
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.380]   this inhibitory neurotransmitter
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.740]   that can act as a little bit of a mild sedative,
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.260]   can reduce irritability, et cetera.
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:38.920]   But that's just the baseline,
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.280]   the kind of tide of those neuromodulators.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.300]   Again, I want to emphasize
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.660]   that we still have neural circuits within the brain and body
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:47.860]   that are specifically releasing in a very potent way,
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:50.100]   dopamine, serotonin, and GABA.
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.260]   So the two things act in concert.
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.780]   Even though the gut and the brain
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.420]   are acting both in parallel
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.100]   and directly influencing one another,
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.820]   it is a powerful synergistic effect.
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:04.220]   And there are now hundreds of studies,
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:06.820]   maybe even thousands by this point,
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:10.340]   mostly performed in animal models, typically mice,
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.260]   but also some studies in humans
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.560]   that show that creating the correct environment
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.320]   for these gut microbiota to thrive
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.560]   really does enhance mood and wellbeing.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:25.200]   And that when our gut microbiome is not healthy,
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.780]   that it really can deplete our mood and sense of wellbeing.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:31.500]   Now, there are two major phases
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:33.920]   to creating a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.580]   One you can control,
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:38.620]   and the other one is less under your control.
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:40.860]   I get into this in a lot of detail
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.780]   in the episode with Dr. Sonnenberg,
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:46.540]   which is coming out immediately after this one,
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:48.500]   the following Monday, that is.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:52.420]   But for now, I want to just capture a few of the main points
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.440]   about the early establishment of the gut microbiome.
[00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:01.060]   It turns out that the environment that we are exposed to,
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.180]   the things that come into contact
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.960]   with our skin and digestive tract
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.440]   and any other mucosal lining,
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.380]   even the urethra, the nasal passages,
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.140]   any opening to the outside world
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.600]   that brings in certain, excuse me,
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.820]   certain microbiota in the first three years of life
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:20.100]   is going to have a profound impact
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.920]   on the overall menu of microbiota
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:27.300]   that we will be able to carry within our body.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.340]   And it really does seem that getting exposure to
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.300]   and building a diverse microbiome
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.900]   in those first three years is critical.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.580]   There's a lot of speculation and some data
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.520]   as to cesarean-delivered babies
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.140]   having less diverse microbiomes
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.760]   compared to vaginally-delivered babies.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.940]   There have been attempts,
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.980]   although not conclusive attempts,
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.600]   to link that to the presence of autism spectrum disorders,
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.580]   which at least by some statistics
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:57.740]   seem to be of higher probability in cesarean deliveries,
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.420]   although there are other studies that refute that,
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.860]   and I want to make that clear.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:06.220]   However, it's clear that babies do not get much,
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:10.460]   if any, exposure to microbiota inside of the womb,
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.900]   maybe a little bit, but not much.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:13.660]   But it is during the birth process
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.460]   and in the days and weeks immediately after
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.740]   they arrive in the world
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.860]   that their gut microbiome is established,
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.380]   that those gut microbiota take residence within the gut.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.860]   So it will depend on whether or not
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.360]   they were breastfed or bottle fed.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.540]   It will depend on whether or not
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:30.780]   they were exposed to a household pet or not,
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:33.360]   whether or not they were held by multiple caregivers
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.180]   or just by one, whether or not they were a preemie baby
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:39.680]   and were contained in a particularly restrictive environment
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.520]   in order to encourage their further development
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.700]   before they could be brought home or not.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.700]   I don't want to give the picture that if you were isolated
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.740]   or you were delivered by C-section
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.780]   that you're somehow doomed to have a poor microbiome.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.540]   That's simply not the case.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:55.540]   However, it is the case that the more diversity
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:02:00.060]   of microbiota that one can create early in life
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.380]   is really helpful for long-term outcomes
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:07.840]   in terms of brain to gut signaling, gut to brain signaling,
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.940]   and for sake of the immune system.
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:14.940]   There are some decent studies showing that
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.340]   if children are exposed to a lot of antibiotic treatment
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:21.040]   early in life, that can be very detrimental
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.760]   to establishment of a healthy gut microbiome.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.060]   And fortunately, that reestablishing
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.260]   a healthy gut microbiome can help rescue
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.660]   some of those deficits.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.520]   So doctors nowadays are much more cautious
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.180]   about the prescription of antibiotic drugs
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:37.140]   to children in their early years,
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.220]   not just up to three years,
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.960]   but extending out to five and seven and 10 years.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.580]   And even in adults, they're very, very careful about that,
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.120]   or they ought to be.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.260]   One reason is the existence or I would say the proliferation
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.940]   of antibiotic resistant bacteria
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.760]   that are becoming more common in hospitals and elsewhere,
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.500]   and that can cause serious problems.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.720]   But in addition to that, because of this understanding
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.240]   that the gut microbiome is influencing and actually creating
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.980]   neurotransmitters that can impact mood and mental health,
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.140]   impact immune health, and so on.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.760]   As I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds,
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.900]   if not thousands of studies emphasizing the key role
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.500]   of the microbiome on brain health,
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.060]   psychiatric health, et cetera.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.580]   I want to just highlight a few of those studies,
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:23.880]   and in particular, some recent studies that come from labs
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.060]   that have been working on this sort of thing
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.600]   for a very long time.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.860]   One of the more exciting studies comes from the work
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.080]   of Mauro Costa-Matioli's lab,
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.180]   which is at Baylor College of Medicine.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:36.160]   Mauro's lab has been working on mouse models
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.140]   of autism spectrum disorder for a long time,
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:42.420]   and looking at social behavior using a mouse model
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:43.520]   for a long time.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.300]   And they've been able to identify particular types
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:52.300]   of microbiota that when they take resonance in the gut
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:56.480]   can help offset some of the symptoms of autism,
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.300]   at least the symptoms of autism that exist
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.500]   in these mouse models, okay?
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.400]   So again, this is not human work.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.000]   This is work being done on mouse models
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.020]   for the simple reason
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.020]   that you can do these kinds of manipulations,
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.880]   where basically they took mice
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.300]   that were in germ-free environments
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.580]   or non-germ-free environments,
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.980]   or they exposed mice to particular microbiota
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.380]   and not other microbiota,
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:18.700]   and they discovered that a particular microbiota
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:23.700]   called L-reuteri, it's L period, R-E-U-T-E-R-I,
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:28.380]   treatment with L-reuteri corrects the social deficits
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.180]   present in these autism models.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:32.940]   And it does so by way of activating our old friend,
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.300]   the vagus nerve,
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.940]   but not simply because the vagus nerve triggers
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.220]   the release of dopamine,
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:41.120]   but it turns out that this particular gut microbiota,
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.620]   L-reuteri, can correct the social deficits
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.980]   in this autism spectrum disorder model.
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:48.220]   It does that by way of a vagal nerve pathway
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:49.940]   that stimulates both dopamine release
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:50.980]   and oxytocin release.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.980]   And they established this really mechanistically
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.540]   by showing, for instance, if you get rid
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.480]   of the oxytocin receptor, you don't see this rescue.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.620]   Now, those are mouse models.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.700]   So we have to take those with the appropriate grain of salt,
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:02.780]   but they're really exciting.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:06.820]   And they come to us in parallel with other studies
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.180]   that are being done taking the microbiomes
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:13.780]   of people who have one condition or lack of condition
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.460]   and putting it into people who have one condition
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:17.420]   or another condition.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.180]   Let me explain what I mean by that.
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:22.320]   The early discovery of the gut microbiome
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.300]   and its potential to impact health was not in the context
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.480]   of the gut to brain pathway,
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.800]   but rather it was in the context of colitis.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.320]   This dates back to studies in the '50s,
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.900]   whereby people with very severe intractable colitis
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.120]   for which no other treatment was going to work
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.840]   received fecal transplants.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.700]   So yes, that's exactly as it sounds,
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.120]   taking the stool of healthy people who do not have colitis,
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.580]   transplanting those stools into the lower digestive tract
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.340]   of people who do have colitis.
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.880]   And they saw significant improvement,
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.940]   if not rescue of the colitis.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.420]   That was one of the first indications
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.800]   that something within stool of all things
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.720]   could actually rescue another individual from disease,
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.040]   which sounds kind of wild and crazy
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.380]   and may even sound disgusting to some of you.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:12.940]   But as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:17.940]   almost 60% of stool is live or dead bacteria, microbiota.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.740]   And it really opened up this entire field
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.180]   of exploring how different microbiota
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.360]   might have therapeutic effects.
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.900]   And indeed, that has been shown to be the case
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.900]   also in fecal transplants for certain psychiatric illnesses.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:35.280]   These are still ongoing studies.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.720]   They vary in quality.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.380]   These are hard studies to do for all sorts of reasons,
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.120]   getting the appropriate patient populations,
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.560]   getting agreement, et cetera,
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.800]   making sure that everything's handled properly.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.340]   But what this involves is fecal transplants
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.100]   from individuals that lack a particular
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.440]   psychiatric condition or metabolic condition
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.980]   into people who have a particular metabolic condition.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.680]   And there has been tremendous success in some cases.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.600]   One of the more powerful and salient examples
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.960]   is for obesity.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.060]   There are some people for which,
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.420]   even if they ingest very low numbers of calories,
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.440]   even if they go on a liquid protein diet,
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.560]   simply can't lose weight.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.920]   These are somewhat rare disorders,
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.960]   but these are people that would either
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.320]   get gastric bypass surgery.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.380]   Some people are now getting these fecal transplants
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:25.380]   from people that have healthy weight
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.480]   and they take the stool from them,
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.400]   they put it into lower digestive tract,
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.360]   and they can see substantial improvement in weight loss
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.720]   in people that were otherwise unable to do that.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.960]   In some cases, actually,
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.340]   they can start eating relatively normal levels of food
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.240]   and still lose weight.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.260]   So pretty remarkable.
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:44.480]   And that tells us there's something in these microbiota
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.860]   that's really powerful.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:49.120]   Now, how those effects are generated isn't clear.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.480]   One idea is that it's impacting
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.600]   the metabolome components of the metabolism.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.580]   Almost certainly that's going to be the case.
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:59.380]   Another idea is that it's impacting neurotransmitters,
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:02.440]   which change behavior and food choices within the brain.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.280]   Although, as I mentioned,
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.920]   some of these people are already eating
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.700]   very little food to begin with.
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:10.720]   So that's a little bit harder of an argument to create.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.180]   There are also some somewhat famous examples now
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:16.780]   of how fecal transplants can lead to negative outcomes.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.400]   But those negative outcomes further underscore
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.280]   the power of the microbiome in impacting bodily health.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.720]   One key example of this, for instance,
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.040]   is transfer of fecal matter into another person
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.200]   in order to treat something like colitis.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.840]   And it effectively does that.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.600]   But if the donor of the stool of the fecal matter
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.680]   happened to be obese or have some other metabolic syndrome,
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.440]   it's been observed that the recipient
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.900]   can also develop that metabolic syndrome
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.340]   simply by way of receiving
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:53.260]   that donor's particular microbiota.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:55.820]   So these microbiota can create positive outcomes
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:57.960]   or they can create negative outcomes.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.280]   Now, most of us, of course, are not interested in
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.720]   or pursuing fecal transplants.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.540]   Most people are interested in just creating
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.720]   a healthy gut microbiome environment
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.560]   for sake of immune system and brain function.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.620]   And we will talk about how to do that in just a few minutes.
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.440]   But I just want to further underscore
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:17.940]   the power of the microbiota in shaping brain chemistry
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:20.140]   and in shaping things like mood
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.500]   or other aspects of mental health
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.440]   that typically we don't associate with our gut.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.760]   There are several studies published in recent years.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.200]   One that I'll just highlight now,
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:32.480]   first author, it's Tanya Nguyen, N-G-U-Y-E-N.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.160]   The title of the paper is Association of Loneliness
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.840]   and Wisdom with Gut Microbial Diversity and Composition,
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.280]   an exploratory study.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:41.540]   It's an interesting study,
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:45.960]   looked at 184 community dwelling adults, excuse me,
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.200]   ranging from 28 to 97 years old.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.100]   They explored whether or not
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.580]   having enhanced microbial diversity
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.760]   somehow related to these variables
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.600]   that they refer to as loneliness and wisdom.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.140]   They used a number of different tests to evaluate those.
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:04.600]   Those are common tests in the psychology literature,
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.380]   not so much in the biology literature,
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.900]   but nonetheless, there are ways of measuring things
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.800]   like loneliness and wisdom.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:16.500]   Wisdom in this case being the opposite of loneliness,
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.040]   at least in the context of this study.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.660]   And what they found was the more microbial diversity,
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.920]   the more diverse one's microbiome was,
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.840]   the lower incidence of loneliness.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.120]   And they did this by taking fecal samples,
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.520]   profiling them for RNA.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.640]   So essentially doing gene sequencing of the stool,
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.760]   of these individuals,
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.720]   getting ratings of how lonely or not lonely they felt
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.000]   and correlating those.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.720]   And that's just but one study.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.180]   I pointed out because it's particularly recent
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:43.600]   and it looked like it was particularly well done.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.560]   There is another study that I'll just refer you to.
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.240]   This was a study published in 2020 in Scientific Reports.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.080]   The title of the study is emotional wellbeing
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.240]   and gut microbiome profiles by enterotype.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.740]   What I particularly like about this study
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.120]   is that they were able to correlate
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.900]   the presence of certain microbiota
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.620]   with feelings of subjective wellbeing
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:05.140]   and lack of or presence of depressive symptoms.
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:08.780]   They did high throughput gene sequencing
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.520]   of the microbiomes of individuals.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.440]   So that meant measuring the microbiota,
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.660]   figuring out which microbiota were present,
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.220]   how diverse their microbiome was.
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.780]   In general, gut microbiome diversity is a good thing.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.340]   And then to correlate that
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:26.220]   with what's called the PANAS score.
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.880]   PANAS stands for positive affect, negative affect schedule.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.900]   This is a test that my lab has used extensively
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.820]   that other labs use to evaluate mood and wellbeing.
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:38.620]   And they defined what were called three enterotypes,
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.100]   three different categories of people
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.140]   that ate very different diets
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.040]   that tended to fall into categories
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:48.840]   of having more or fewer emotional symptoms that were negative
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.040]   or more or fewer emotional symptoms that were positive,
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.260]   and whether or not they tend to be more depressed, anxious,
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.760]   or have more stress-related behaviors, et cetera.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.980]   And what they were able to derive from this study
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:04.120]   was some strong indications about what types of things
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.940]   we should ingest in our diet,
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.700]   maybe even certain things that we should avoid,
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.100]   but certainly the types of things that we should ingest
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.400]   that can enhance mood and wellbeing
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.240]   and can tend to shift people away from more depressive-like
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.240]   anxiety and stress-related symptoms.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.920]   Before we get into what the particular food items were
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.740]   that lend themselves to a healthy microbiome,
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.740]   I want to raise a bigger and perhaps more important issue,
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:28.480]   which is what is a healthy microbiome?
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:32.060]   I think if you asked any number of world experts,
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.880]   and I certainly asked this of Dr. Sonnenberg,
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.460]   what is a healthy microbiome?
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.200]   They're all going to tell you it's a microbiome
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.940]   that has a lot of diversity,
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:42.140]   that includes a lot of different types of bacteria.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:45.020]   And that makes sense because it logically would include
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:48.860]   the bacteria that produce GABA and dopamine and serotonin,
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.420]   and that support the immune system
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.900]   and do a number of different things.
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:56.380]   But is it simply the case that adding microbiota diversity
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.420]   is always a good thing?
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.740]   Well, that doesn't seem to be the case.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:04.020]   Probiotics and prebiotics,
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.980]   both of which can enhance microbiota diversity,
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:10.660]   can improve mood digestion, immune system, and so on.
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:11.760]   That's been established,
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.580]   but it's mainly been established in the context
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.880]   of post antibiotic treatment
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.720]   or people that are recovering from illness
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:20.900]   or people that have been very stressed
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.020]   or have been dealing with all sorts of challenges,
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.260]   mental or physical,
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:28.900]   and they are an attempt to replenish the gut microbiome.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:33.900]   However, it's also clear that excessive microbiota
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:38.700]   brought about by excessive intake of probiotics
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:40.240]   can lead to things like brain fog.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.800]   There's actually some good studies that point to the fact
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.380]   that certain metabolites of the microbiome,
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:49.480]   certain chemicals produced in the gut and in the body
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.840]   can actually lead to brain fog states.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.840]   This is thought to come about
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.860]   through the lactate pathways of the gut
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:57.960]   that can then impact the brain.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.080]   If you want to look more into this issue
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.340]   of whether or not probiotics taken in excess, perhaps,
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.500]   can lead to brain fog,
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.340]   I'd encourage you to look at a particular paper.
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:09.780]   This is a paper published in
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:12.780]   Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology,
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:13.620]   and the title of the paper is
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.580]   "Brain Fogginess, Gas, and Bloating,
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:19.580]   A Link Between SIBO, Probiotics, and Metabolic Acidosis."
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.780]   It was published in 2018.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.420]   We can provide a link to this study.
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:25.560]   And there are several other studies in the references
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:29.900]   that point to the fact that in some cases,
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.540]   excessive intake of probiotics
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:33.740]   and excessive proliferation of gut microbiota
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:35.180]   can actually be problematic.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.740]   I mentioned this not to confuse you,
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:41.100]   but because it is confusing out there.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:44.420]   We all would think that just increasing microbiota diversity
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:45.760]   is always a good thing,
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.140]   but there are thresholds beyond which
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:52.020]   excessive microbiota diversity might be problematic.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:55.840]   I think everyone agrees that having too few
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.440]   microbial species living in us is not a good idea.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.040]   Now, none of that answers the questions
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.920]   that I think everyone really wants answers to,
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.420]   which are what should we do?
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:09.280]   What should we not do to improve our gut microbiome?
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.760]   I mean, clearly we can't time travel back
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.960]   to when we were zero to three years old
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.740]   and get a dog if we didn't have a dog,
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.880]   get breastfed if we weren't breastfed,
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.560]   be delivered vaginally as opposed to by C-section
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.240]   if we didn't have that opportunity,
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.260]   we just can't time travel and do that.
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.100]   All of us, however,
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:28.360]   should be seeking to improve the conditions
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.580]   of our gut microbiome because of the critical ways
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:33.120]   in which it impacts the rest of our brain
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.660]   and bodily health.
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.500]   So what should we do?
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.480]   What shouldn't we do?
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.020]   Clearly we know that stress can negatively impact
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:40.080]   the gut microbiome.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.000]   However, some forms of stress that can quote unquote
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.200]   negatively impact the microbiome include fasting,
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.240]   long periods of fast, which makes sense
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.860]   because a lot of microbiota need food in order to thrive.
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:55.820]   In fact, many, if not all of them do at some point.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.460]   There are other questions such as,
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.960]   should we eat particular foods
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.960]   and how often should we eat those foods?
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.920]   We've all been told that fiber is incredibly important
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.680]   because of the presence of prebiotic fiber,
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.640]   which can essentially feed the microbiome,
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.000]   but is fiber really necessary
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.940]   and how necessary is it to encourage a healthy microbiome?
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.100]   Clearly there are a number of people following
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:22.880]   relatively low fiber diets such as ketogenic diets,
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.680]   and those can have in some cases anti-inflammatory effects
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:31.040]   and can sometimes also improve certain microbiota species.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.440]   So it can all be rather confusing.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.860]   And for that matter, I asked our resident expert,
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:39.780]   Dr. Justin Sonnenberg at Stanford, all of these questions.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:43.000]   And he answers them very systematically in the episode
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   that comes out after this one.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.620]   But I don't want to withhold anything from you.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.280]   So I'll just give a very top contour version
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.520]   of those answers, and then you'll get more in-depth answers
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.120]   during that episode.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.400]   I asked about fasting.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.820]   And the reason I asked about fasting is that years ago,
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.280]   I was at a meeting as part
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.120]   of the Pew Biomedical Scholars meeting.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:05.560]   And one of the other Pew Biomedical Scholars
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.160]   was an expert in gut microbiome.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.480]   And I said, "Hey, are probiotics good for the microbiome?
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.200]   "And if so, which one should I take?"
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.480]   And his answer was very interesting.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:18.400]   He said, "In certain cases, they can be,
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.200]   "especially if you're traveling or you're stressed.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.720]   "But it turns out that the particular bacteria
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.640]   "that they put in most probiotics
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.720]   "don't actually replenish the microbiota that you need most."
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.860]   And I thought, "Oh, well, why don't they make ones
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.640]   "that replenish the microbiota that you need most?"
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.160]   And his answer was, "Well, they don't replenish those,
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:43.320]   "but they replenish other ones that then in turn encourage
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.020]   "the development of the microbiota that you do want
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:47.920]   "once you start eating the appropriate foods."
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.280]   So they changed the environment,
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.480]   which makes the environment better,
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.320]   which indirectly supports the proliferation
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.580]   of quote unquote good microbiota.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.480]   Okay, so that was a somewhat convoluted answer,
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.980]   but I did appreciate his answer.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.700]   Then I asked him about fasting.
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.740]   I said, "Well, a lot of people are getting interested
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.680]   "in intermittent fasting now.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.820]   "People are spending a significant portion
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.820]   "of each 24 hour cycle avoiding food
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:10.260]   "for sake of time restricted feeding.
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:11.700]   "What does that do to the gut microbiome?
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.040]   "Does it make it healthier?
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.480]   "Or does it make it unhealthier?"
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.920]   Well, my colleague from Yale and Dr. Sonnenberg
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.440]   both confirmed that during periods of fasting,
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.400]   especially prolonged periods of fasting,
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.200]   we actually start to digest away much
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.040]   of our digestive tract.
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.000]   Now, the whole thing doesn't start to disappear,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.880]   but there's thinning of the mucosal lining,
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.820]   or at least disruption of the mucosal lining.
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:35.360]   A lot of the microbiota species can start to die off.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.920]   And so it was surprising to me, but nonetheless interesting,
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:42.080]   that fasting may actually cause a disruption
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.260]   to certain healthy elements of the gut microbiome.
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:47.400]   But again, there's a caveat.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:52.060]   The caveat is that when people eat after a period of fast,
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:55.080]   there may be a compensatory proliferation,
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.240]   meaning an increase in healthy gut microbiota.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.400]   So you start to get the picture
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.040]   that fasting is neither good nor bad.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.800]   You start to get the picture that particular diets,
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.700]   meaning certain restriction diets
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.120]   or macronutrient rich diets may not be good
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.880]   or bad for the microbiome.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:15.480]   And yet there are some answers that arrive to us
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.440]   from Dr. Sonnenberg, but from other experts in the field,
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.920]   that there are certain foods
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.560]   and certain things that we can ingest,
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.480]   which definitely enhance the microbiome
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.600]   and make it healthier than it would be
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.080]   were we to not ingest those foods.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.220]   So next, I'd like to talk about what I think
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.160]   is a really pioneering and important study in this area.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.640]   This is a study that was carried out by the Sonnenberg Lab
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.280]   in collaboration with Chris Gardner's lab, also at Stanford,
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:47.120]   where they compared two general types of diets in humans,
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.200]   diets that were fiber rich,
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.460]   which has been proposed time and time again
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.280]   to enhance microbiota diversity
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.440]   and to enhance gut brain signaling even,
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:59.220]   and to enhance the immune system, perhaps,
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.200]   and diets that were enriched
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.040]   in so-called low sugar fermented foods.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.840]   Before I dive into that study and what the conclusions were,
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.960]   because they are very interesting and very actionable
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.320]   for all of us, I do want to touch on probiotics
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.680]   because I want to avoid confusion.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:18.480]   It is not the case that ingestion of probiotics
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.160]   will always lead to brain fog.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.920]   I want to make that clear.
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.720]   It is the case that ingestion of probiotics,
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.320]   even if those probiotics don't directly contain
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:31.600]   the microbiota species that one is trying to proliferate,
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.840]   can be useful for improving microbiota diversity.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.660]   In general, it seems that maintaining a healthy gut microbiome
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.960]   involves ingesting certain types of foods,
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.520]   and we'll talk about those in a moment,
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:50.040]   but perhaps also augmenting the microbiota system
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.520]   through prebiotics or probiotics
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.800]   at a fairly low level on a consistent basis.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.500]   So these are not high dose probiotics,
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:00.280]   except under conditions of dysbiosis,
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.260]   where, for instance,
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:04.340]   if somebody has done a round of antibiotics
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:07.040]   and they need to replenish their gut microbiome,
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.380]   there are foods and there are pill form
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.940]   and powder form prebiotics and probiotics
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.140]   that can be very useful.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:17.000]   Or in cases where people have been very stressed
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.500]   or are undergoing excessive travel
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.540]   or have shifted their diet radically,
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.560]   maybe that's due to travel, maybe that's due to illness,
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.020]   maybe that's due to stress.
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:28.580]   But when there are a number of different converging events
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:33.580]   that are stressing or depleting microbiota diversity,
[01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:35.340]   that's when, at least I believe,
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:37.900]   it can be useful to support the gut microbiome
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:41.980]   through the ingestion of quality probiotics or prebiotics.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.360]   So it would be under conditions where people are stressed
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.740]   or their system is generally stressed
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.680]   for environmental or illness-related reasons,
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:54.040]   that it might be useful to lean towards higher doses
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.780]   of prebiotics or probiotics than one might normally use,
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.680]   but that under normal conditions,
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:03.200]   that one would focus on quality nutrients
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:08.200]   through diet and focus on ingestion of probiotics
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.260]   at a fairly low to moderate level
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:15.020]   and/or prebiotics at a fairly low to moderate level.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:16.720]   That just seems like the logical approach
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.960]   based on the experts that I've spoken to,
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.140]   but certainly if your doctor prescribes
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:24.580]   or suggests that you take high levels of probiotics
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:25.580]   for any reason,
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.180]   you should definitely pay attention to your physician
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.220]   and you should obviously pay attention to your physician.
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:32.360]   In any case, you should never add or remove anything
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.980]   from your nutritional plan or supplementation plan
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.100]   without consulting a physician.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.500]   So what should we do in order to maximize the health
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:42.100]   of our gut brain axis, as it's called?
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.880]   How should we support the diversity of the good microbiota
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.820]   that help us create all these neurotransmitters
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:52.020]   that we want, improve our immune system function,
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:53.860]   and so on and so forth?
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:57.700]   Well, some of that is going to be through the basics.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.720]   When I say the basics, I mean the foundational things
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:02.220]   that really set us up for overall health.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:05.260]   So this is going to be getting deep sleep
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:09.600]   of sufficient duration, 80 plus percent of the time.
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.360]   I mean, if you could get 100% of the time, that'd be great,
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.960]   but very few people accomplish that.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.220]   It's going to be proper hydration.
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.100]   It's going to be proper social interactions.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:17.680]   It's going to be proper nutrition,
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.220]   and we'll talk more about nutrition in a moment.
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:23.000]   It's going to be limiting excessive prolonged stressors
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.920]   or stress, and indeed we've done episodes
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.560]   about just about all of those things,
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.000]   but certainly about stress.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.960]   We have an episode of the Huberman Lab podcast
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.520]   that you can find at HubermanLab.com
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:33.820]   all about mastering stress,
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:37.180]   how to avoid long periods of intense stress,
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:38.640]   what to do to offset those.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:43.400]   Given that stress can disrupt the microbiome,
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.920]   whether or not you're fasting or not,
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.440]   those tools ought to be useful.
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.320]   Now, in what I consider to be a landmark study
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.200]   exploring the relationship between the gut microbiome,
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:58.020]   food intake, and overall health is this paper
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:01.560]   from Justin Sonnenberg's lab and Chris Gardner's lab,
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.620]   both of which are at Stanford,
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:06.500]   and the paper entitled "Gut Microbiota Targeted Diets
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.080]   Modulate Human Immune Status"
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.540]   was published in the journal Cell,
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:11.760]   which is among the three top journals,
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.840]   perhaps in the world, Nature, Science, and Cell
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.500]   really being the apex journals for overall science,
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:21.120]   and especially for biomedical sciences.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.420]   Now, this is a very interesting study.
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:24.700]   It was done on humans.
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:25.960]   There were two major groups.
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.140]   One group of humans was instructed
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:30.820]   to increase the amount of fiber in their diet,
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:33.360]   and in fact, ate a high fiber diet.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.120]   The other group was instructed
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:38.640]   to eat a high fermented food diet.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.160]   Now, both groups started off
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:45.100]   not having eaten a lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods,
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.800]   and were told to increase the amount of either fiber
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.700]   or fermented foods that they were ingesting
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.600]   over a four-week ramp-up period,
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.600]   and that was to avoid any major gastric distress.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.720]   It turns out that if you're not already accustomed
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.760]   to eating a lot of fiber,
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:00.140]   increasing your amount of fiber dramatically
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.000]   can cause some gastric distress,
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.560]   but if you ease into it over time,
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.860]   as we'll see, there's a mechanism behind this,
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:08.020]   which was unveiled in this study,
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.620]   but if you ease into it over time,
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:11.560]   then the system can tolerate it.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.140]   Likewise, high fermented foods can be readily tolerated
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:18.640]   if there's a ramp-up phase of ingesting
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.780]   maybe one serving a day, then maybe two servings,
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:23.180]   and ramping up, in this case,
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:25.180]   as high as six servings per day.
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:29.920]   However, after this ramp-up period,
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.040]   the group assigned to the high fiber condition
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.900]   maintained high fiber intake for six weeks,
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:36.600]   and the high fermented food group
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:40.360]   maintained high fermented food intake for six weeks,
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:44.200]   after which they went off either the high fiber
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.580]   or the high fermented food diet,
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.660]   and there was a four-week follow-up period
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:50.440]   during which they gradually returned to baseline.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.280]   Throughout the study,
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.600]   their gut microbiome was evaluated
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:56.200]   for the diversity of gut microbiota,
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.140]   and there were also a number of measures
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:59.820]   of immune system function,
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:03.200]   in particular, measures of the so-called inflammatome.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.520]   The immune system has a lot of different molecules involved.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.200]   I did a whole episode about the immune system.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.220]   If you're interested in learning
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:09.840]   what some of those molecules are,
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.960]   various cytokines and signaling molecules
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.800]   that reflect either high inflammation states
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.400]   or reduced inflammation states in the brain and body,
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.080]   you're welcome to check out that episode.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.600]   It's also at hubermanlab.com.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.000]   Regardless, in this study,
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.400]   they explored the sorts of immune markers
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.600]   that were expressed in either of the two groups
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.860]   and compared those.
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:32.800]   The basic takeaway of this paper
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.240]   was that contrary to what they predicted,
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.120]   the high fiber diet did not lead
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.440]   to increased microbiota diversity,
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.020]   at least not in all cases,
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:45.520]   and that was somewhat surprising.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.160]   You know, the idea is that prebiotic fiber
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.720]   and a lot of the material in fruits and vegetables
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:51.940]   and grains and so forth
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:56.380]   are supposed to support microbiota diversity
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:59.320]   and the proliferation of existing microbiota,
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.640]   and that is not what they observed,
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.580]   although I want to be very clear in pointing out
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.040]   that the results did not indicate
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:10.040]   that fiber is not useful for health overall,
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.280]   but it does point to the fact
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:13.040]   that increasing fiber intake
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.120]   did not increase microbiota diversity,
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.560]   which in general, as I mentioned before,
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.760]   is associated with improvements
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:24.760]   in microbiota function, health, and overall wellbeing.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:26.960]   Now, the high fermented food diet condition
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.440]   was very interesting.
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:31.540]   It resulted in increased microbiome diversity
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:35.000]   and decreased inflammatory signals and activity.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.560]   So there was a twofer,
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.200]   basically by ingesting high fermented foods
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.600]   in fair abundance, right?
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.800]   You know, four to six servings or more per day
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.100]   is a lot of fermented food intake.
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.120]   We'll talk about what some of those foods were,
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.360]   but the outcome was very positive.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.540]   There was a clear increase in microbiome diversity
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:56.040]   and decreased inflammatory signals.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.320]   So things like interleukin-6,
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.700]   a number of other interleukins and cytokines
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:03.520]   that are associated with increased inflammation
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:06.400]   in the brain and body were reduced significantly.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.880]   Now, let's talk a little bit about this notion
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.060]   of number of servings, et cetera.
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:13.960]   One somewhat minor point of the study,
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.100]   but I think is useful in terms of taking
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.000]   an actionable stance with this,
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.220]   is that the number of servings of fermented foods
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:25.400]   was not as strong a predictor of improvements
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.280]   in the inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation,
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.960]   and improvements in microbiota diversity,
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.240]   as was the duration of time
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.580]   that the individuals were ingesting fermented foods.
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:38.780]   In other words, the longer that one is consistently
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.220]   ingesting fermented foods on a daily basis,
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:44.160]   the better the outcomes in terms of the gut microbiome
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.320]   and for reducing inflammation.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.340]   So I think that's an important point.
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:50.780]   And I make that point, especially because
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:53.340]   for a lot of people, even if you do this ramp up phase,
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.660]   six servings per day of fermented foods
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:57.340]   can seem like quite a lot.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.900]   So what are these fermented foods, right?
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:03.440]   I think many of us are familiar with certain cheeses
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.780]   and being fermented and beer being fermented
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:07.580]   and kombucha is fermented.
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.280]   In this study, they focus specifically
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.540]   on low sugar fermented foods.
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:13.240]   So this would be plain yogurt,
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:17.840]   in some cases, kimchi or sauerkraut.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.520]   An important consideration, however,
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.360]   is that it needs to contain
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.140]   what are called live active cultures,
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:26.460]   which means there actually have to be microbiota
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:28.480]   that are alive inside the sauerkraut.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:30.240]   One way you know whether or not that's happening
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.440]   is if you purchase sauerkraut or pickles or kimchi
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.340]   from a jar or a container that's on the non-refrigerated
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:41.560]   shelf or the non-refrigerated section of your grocery store,
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.380]   it is not going to contain
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:46.460]   live active cultures of microbiota.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:50.420]   And likewise, if you consume yogurt that has a lot of sugar
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:53.080]   or other components added to it,
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:55.380]   it's not going to have the same positive effect
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:57.940]   on the microbiome, at least that's the prediction,
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:59.940]   given some of the relationship between
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:01.940]   the sorts of microbiota that live in sugar
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:04.180]   versus plain type yogurts.
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:05.980]   They gave people the option of consuming
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:08.780]   any number of different low sugar fermented foods.
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:10.920]   So again, that could be sauerkraut, kimchi,
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.920]   things like kefir, natto.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:17.780]   In Japan, they consume natto, which is a fermented food.
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:20.400]   Beer was not one of the fermented foods
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.860]   that was included in the fermented food list.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.100]   And when we say six servings per day,
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:29.060]   that is indeed six ounce servings
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:31.580]   or four to six ounce servings.
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:34.820]   It was not six servings of what's listed on the package.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.740]   So again, that turns out to be
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:38.300]   a fair amount of fermented foods.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:39.340]   How should you gauge whether or not
[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:40.180]   you're getting enough of this?
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:43.380]   Well, if you decide to take on this protocol
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:44.860]   of ingesting more fermented foods,
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:47.140]   which at least by my read of this study
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:49.180]   and some of the follow-up work that's being done,
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.900]   sounds like a terrific idea.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.780]   If you want to improve your gut microbiome
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:55.540]   for all the great reasons that one would want to,
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:59.500]   brain, body, health, reduced inflammation, and on and on,
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:03.000]   well then you definitely want to focus on fermented foods
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.420]   that you enjoy consuming.
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:07.780]   So for you, if that's kefir, or for you that's plain yogurt,
[01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:09.180]   or for you that's sauerkraut,
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.040]   which happens to be my personal favorite,
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.660]   then you want to make sure that it's going to be something
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:17.780]   that you are going to enjoy ingesting quite a lot of,
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:20.380]   and that you're going to be okay with ingesting
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:21.860]   probably throughout the day.
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:23.960]   Now, people follow different meal schedules, of course,
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.100]   but this does require not just eating
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.980]   all the fermented foods just before bedtime or one meal.
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:31.540]   I suppose you could do that.
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.340]   But in general, it's going to work best
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:35.320]   in terms of limiting gastric distress
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.500]   by spreading it out throughout the day.
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.020]   I also want to mention brine.
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:43.600]   Brine is the liquid that surrounds sauerkraut.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.980]   It's that very salty fluid,
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:49.700]   and that contains a lot of active live cultures.
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.140]   And they did include,
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:55.740]   or they allowed people to include brine in this study.
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:57.860]   And in discussions with Dr. Sonnenberg,
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:00.980]   which we'll go into in more detail on the episode
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:02.180]   that comes out next week,
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:04.140]   we talk a lot about the particular value
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.360]   that brine might hold
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:08.540]   in terms of bringing about microbiota diversity
[01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:12.020]   because of the richness of live cultures that it contains.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:14.500]   I do want to focus for a moment on the high fiber condition
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.180]   because there were some interesting observations
[01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:18.780]   about the people that were placed into that condition.
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:23.140]   First of all, increasing the amount of fiber
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:26.960]   definitely increased the number of enzymes
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.820]   that can be used to digest fiber.
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:32.860]   This is in keeping with this idea of this ramp up phase
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:35.100]   where accumulation of more fiber intake
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:37.660]   can over time lead to less gastric distress,
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:39.560]   but also to more utilization of fiber,
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.300]   which overall should be a good thing.
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:43.780]   So while they didn't observe an increase
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:45.520]   in immune system function
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:47.660]   or an increase in microbiota diversity,
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:51.580]   there was an increase in these fiber digesting enzymes.
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:52.420]   They also observed
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:55.180]   what they called personalized immune responses.
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:57.980]   There were some subgroups within the high fiber group
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:02.700]   that had interesting changes in terms of their reactions to,
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:05.060]   or I should say their inflammatome,
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.860]   meaning the inflammatory markers they expressed
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:09.660]   as well as their microbiota diversity.
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:11.060]   So there were essentially three groups.
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:14.580]   One group actually showed an increase in inflammatory markers
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:15.820]   so that was quite surprising
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:19.580]   and probably not wonderful for the message
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:21.140]   that fiber is always good for us,
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:25.820]   but that was a small cohort within the fiber intake group.
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:28.660]   Another group, and still another group,
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:31.860]   both showed reductions in baseline microbiota diversity,
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:34.300]   although to varying degrees.
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:36.660]   So I don't want to paint the picture that fiber is bad,
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:39.060]   but fiber certainly did not have the positive effects
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:40.780]   on microbiota diversity
[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:43.180]   that the high fermented food diet did.
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.340]   So my read of this study,
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:46.980]   and I think the stance that many others have taken
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:48.620]   as a consequence of these data,
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:52.540]   is that we should be increasing our fermented food intake,
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:54.640]   that that's simply a good thing to do
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.500]   in order to support our gut microbiome
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:00.540]   and to reduce inflammatory signals in our brain and body.
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:02.500]   And there are a number of different ways to do that.
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.220]   I mentioned some of the particular foods.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.580]   However, anytime you're talking about
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:07.420]   ingesting fermented foods,
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:09.340]   especially the high quality ones
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:12.240]   that come from the refrigerated section of the grocery store
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.440]   or that end that have low sugar content, et cetera,
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.340]   we do have to be considerate of cost
[01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:20.400]   because certain things like kombuchas, for instance,
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.480]   can be quite costly.
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.820]   I should also mention some kombuchas
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:26.700]   actually contain alcohol, some do not,
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:28.860]   or contain very little amounts of alcohol.
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:32.800]   One way to avoid the high cost of fermented foods
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.540]   while still being able to accumulate
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:35.920]   a lot of fermented food intake
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.260]   is to simply make those fermented foods yourself.
[01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:40.520]   This is something that we've started exploring
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.820]   and experimenting with in our home.
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:43.940]   One simple way to do this
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:45.600]   is to just make your own sauerkraut.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.980]   It involves very few ingredients.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:50.000]   It basically involves cabbage, water, and salt,
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.100]   but there's a specific process that you need to follow
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:56.180]   in order to create these large volumes of sauerkraut at home
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:58.340]   using that low cost method.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:00.580]   The best resource that I know of
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:04.540]   in order to follow a great recipe to make homemade sauerkraut
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:07.100]   would be the recipe for homemade sauerkraut
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:09.820]   that's contained in Tim Ferriss' book, "The 4-Hour Chef."
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:11.520]   There's an excellent protocol there.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.100]   It involves chopping up the cabbage,
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:16.500]   putting into a bowl, mashing it up with your hands,
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.900]   which can be fun, putting water in there,
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:19.940]   some salt, covering it,
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:21.960]   and then keeping it in a particular environment,
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.820]   and then routinely scraping off
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:25.500]   some of the material from the surface.
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.780]   You have to do that in order to make sure
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:32.200]   that you're not getting microbes and things growing in it
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:33.120]   that are bad for you.
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.780]   So you definitely want to pay careful attention
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:37.580]   to the protocol, but that's a very, very low cost way
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:40.000]   of generating lots and lots of fermented food
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.100]   so you don't go broke trying to improve your microbiome.
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:44.060]   The other thing that you can do
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.500]   if you're really obsessed with kombucha
[01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.820]   or something like that to avoid the high cost of kombucha
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:51.060]   is there are ways that you can get the SCOBY,
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:53.340]   which basically allows you to make your own kombucha at home.
[01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:55.800]   I've never tried this, but when I was a postdoc,
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.860]   there was an undergraduate in the lab, I think,
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:00.760]   well, I won't out him, but he's now gone on
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.600]   to medical school, and I think he's passed his residency
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.320]   and is a practicing doctor.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.760]   But nonetheless, he was always making kombucha at home.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.860]   He told me it was exceedingly easy, but then again,
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:12.620]   he had a number of other skills and attributes
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.520]   that made me think that he could do
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.860]   pretty much anything with ease,
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:18.420]   whereas I tend to struggle with even basic cooking.
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:20.740]   So maybe if you're feeling a little more adventurous,
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:23.320]   you could explore making your own kombucha.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.740]   But there are a number of different protocols
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:25.680]   and recipes out there
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.380]   for making your own low sugar fermented foods.
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:30.100]   So you needn't run out
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:32.260]   and buy fresh sauerkraut all the time.
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:33.500]   I should also mention for those of you
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:37.500]   that are interested in getting your fermented intake
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:41.460]   from pickles, jarred pickles rarely, if ever,
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:42.660]   contain ferment.
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:45.180]   Mostly they're just soaked in vinegar water
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:46.060]   and with some spices,
[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:48.140]   but there are some that contain ferment.
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:50.700]   You actually have to look for that on the container.
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:51.900]   And I don't know, maybe someone out there
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.660]   knows how to make natto and knows how to make kimchi well
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:56.180]   and things of that sort.
[01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:59.120]   It certainly is the case based on the data from the study
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:02.180]   that ingesting more servings of fermented food per day
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:04.260]   ought to be beneficial for our gut microbiome.
[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:05.420]   And since this is an episode,
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:08.480]   not just about gut microbiome, but gut brain health,
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.000]   I should mention that one form of signaling
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.700]   between the gut microbiome and the brain,
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.980]   which we did not discuss, and I'll just touch on briefly,
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:19.300]   is that when the inflammatome
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:22.200]   or the genes and markers of inflammation
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.220]   are kept in a healthy range,
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:27.100]   there's an active signaling
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:29.400]   of that immune system status to the brain.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.520]   There's an intermediate cell type
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:34.300]   that communicates immune status to the brain.
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.220]   And that cell type is the microglial cell.
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:38.700]   It's a type of glia, as the name suggests.
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:41.500]   When there's a lot of inflammation in the body,
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.780]   these microglia actually get activated
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:47.180]   and can start eating away at various components
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:48.420]   of the brain and nervous system.
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:49.760]   And I don't mean massive eating away.
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.240]   They're not going to digest the whole brain,
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:55.220]   but these microglia are sort of the resident macrophages
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.060]   of the brain.
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:57.420]   Macrophages are in the periphery
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.800]   and they gobble up debris and things of that sort.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.380]   The microglia on a regular basis are eating up debris
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:05.840]   that accumulates across waking cycles
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.140]   and in response to micro-damage of the brain
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:09.440]   that occurs on a daily basis.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:11.820]   So they have a lot of important basic everyday
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:13.720]   what we call housekeeping functions.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.920]   But when there's a lot of inflammation in the body,
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:18.680]   when there's a massive immune response,
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.800]   the microglia can be hyperactivated
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.440]   and that's thought to lead to any number
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.700]   of different cognitive defects or challenges thinking,
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:29.200]   or maybe even some forms of neurodegeneration over time.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.440]   Although that last point is more of a hypothesis
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.080]   than a well tamped down fact at this point.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.680]   There's still a lot of investigation to be done in humans.
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:39.560]   The animal data, however, are very, very strong
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.480]   that when the immune system is activated
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:44.140]   or chronically activated or hyperactivated,
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.820]   that neural tissue, meaning brain tissue
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.980]   and other central nervous system tissue can suffer.
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:49.700]   So there are a lot of reasons
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:53.200]   to want to not just improve microbiome diversity,
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.160]   but to also improve immune system function
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:58.800]   and to limit the number of inflammatory markers
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.120]   that are present in the body
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.320]   because of the way those inflammatory markers
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.340]   can signal deleterious events in the brain.
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:07.840]   And while eating fermented foods
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.840]   and making your own fermented foods
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.880]   and buying high quality fermented foods
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.760]   might seem like an inconvenience,
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.500]   I would say that from the perspective of cost benefit
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:21.020]   or effort benefit, it's actually quite a good situation
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:24.180]   where if you can just ramp up the number of fermented foods
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:26.380]   or servings of fermented foods that you're eating per day
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:27.700]   over a period of a few weeks
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.220]   so that you're tolerating that well,
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:32.240]   that ought to have a very positive effect
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.180]   on your microbiome diversity
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:36.720]   and indeed on gut brain function.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:38.100]   And I'll be the last to suggest
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:40.500]   that people completely forgo on fiber.
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:41.860]   I think there's some debate out there
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:43.400]   as to how much fiber we need
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:46.100]   and whether or not certain forms of fiber
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:47.260]   are better than others.
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:48.620]   I'm not going to get into that debate.
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:49.760]   It's barbed wire enough
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:52.740]   without me injecting my own views into that debate.
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:55.060]   But I think there's ample evidence to support the fact
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:57.020]   that for most people,
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:00.360]   ingesting a fair amount of fiber is going to be a good idea.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:01.340]   I would just say that make sure
[01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:04.160]   that you're also ingesting a fair amount of fermented foods.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.100]   And along the lines of fiber,
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:08.660]   in an accompanying article published in Cell,
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:11.660]   which was sort of a, what we call a news and views piece
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:15.320]   about the Sonnenberg and Gardner paper,
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:16.880]   they make a quite good point,
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:19.600]   which is that the increase in fiber intake
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:23.120]   that led to this increase in carbohydrate active enzymes,
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.520]   these CAZ-zymes as they're called,
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.280]   these are enzymes that help digest fiber,
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:31.820]   quote, "Indicating an enhanced capacity for the microbiome
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:35.400]   to degrade complex carbohydrates present in fibrous foods."
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:40.400]   So in other words, eating more fiber and fibrous foods
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.520]   allowed for an increase in these enzymes
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.840]   that allow you to eat still more fibrous foods
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.020]   or to better digest fibrous foods
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:48.760]   that are coming in through other sources.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:52.560]   So there is at least one utility for increasing fiber,
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.560]   even though it's separate from the gut microbiota diversity
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.400]   and reducing inflammation.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.840]   And I'd be remiss if I didn't touch on some of the data
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:02.460]   and controversy about artificial sweeteners
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:04.440]   and the gut microbiome.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.800]   I want to be very clear that what I'm about to tell you
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:09.280]   has only been established in animal models,
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.780]   in a mouse model, at least to my knowledge.
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:14.560]   What the studies have shown, and there were several,
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.720]   but one published in the journal "Nature" a few years back
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.680]   is the one that got the most amount of attention,
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.760]   is that animals that consume large amounts
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:22.200]   of artificial sweeteners,
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.020]   in particular things like saccharin or sucralose,
[01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:27.620]   show disruptions in their gut microbiome.
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.360]   I'm not aware of any studies in humans
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.680]   that show the equivalent effect,
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.840]   and I'm not aware of any studies in humans
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.720]   that show the equivalent effect
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:37.840]   for things like plant-based low-calorie sweeteners,
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:41.040]   things like stevia, monk fruit, and things of that sort.
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.380]   And at least by my exploration,
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:45.440]   I couldn't find any data specifically related
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.760]   to the sweetener aspartame.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.320]   So right now it's somewhat controversial,
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.840]   and actually this is kind of a third rail topic out there
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.780]   when one group will come out saying
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.060]   that artificial sweeteners are bad
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:41:58.080]   because they disrupt the gut microbiome.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.360]   The response generally from a number of people as well,
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:02.860]   that's only been shown in animal models,
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:04.280]   and indeed that's true.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:06.800]   So right now I don't think that there's a strong case
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.080]   one way or the other.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:10.220]   I think that people should basically ask themselves
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:13.080]   whether or not they like artificial sweeteners or not,
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.560]   whether or not they're willing to risk it or not,
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:18.080]   and obviously that's an individual choice.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.640]   I also want to point out a recent study
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:23.000]   from Diego Bohorquez's lab,
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.840]   which actually shows, however, that neurons in the gut,
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.680]   those neuropod cells, are actually capable
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.080]   of distinguishing between real sugars
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.780]   and artificial sweeteners.
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:36.240]   This is a really interesting body of work.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:40.600]   It was published just recently, I should say, February, 2022.
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:41.720]   The title of the paper is
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.520]   "The preference for sugar over sweetener
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:45.640]   depends on a gut sensor cell."
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:47.160]   And to make a long story short,
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:50.320]   what they showed was there's a category of neuropod cells
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.960]   that recognize sugar in the gut
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:55.040]   and signal that information
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.320]   about the presence of sugar in the gut
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:59.840]   to the brain via the pathways we talked about before,
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:03.560]   the nodose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:06.760]   Interestingly, the very same category of neurons
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:10.240]   can respond to artificial sweeteners
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.120]   and signal that information to the brain,
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:14.720]   but the pattern of signaling,
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.620]   and indeed the signature pattern
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.660]   that is conveyed to the brain and received by the brain,
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:22.720]   is actually quite a bit different
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:25.800]   when these same neurons are responding
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:29.700]   to artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar.
[01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:32.020]   This is very interesting because what it means is,
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:36.140]   first of all, that neurons have incredible specificity
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:37.660]   in terms of what they are signaling
[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:39.440]   from the gut to the brain.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:42.880]   And it also means that there may be a particular signal
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.480]   that the brain receives that says,
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:49.480]   I'm receiving some intake of food or drink that tastes sweet,
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.800]   but doesn't actually offer much nutrients
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:53.960]   in the direction of sweetness,
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:56.700]   meaning that it doesn't have calories despite being sweet.
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:59.040]   Now, again, this is all subconscious processing.
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:00.860]   And like with the previous studies,
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:03.440]   we were just discussing about artificial sweeteners
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.600]   generally and the gut microbiome generally,
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.920]   it's unclear how this relates to humans
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.200]   at this point in time.
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:12.660]   But given the similarity of cellular processes
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:15.860]   and molecular processes at the level of gut brain in mice,
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:18.400]   I think it stands to reason that these neuropod cells
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.880]   very likely are capable of signaling presence
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.720]   of real sweetener versus artificial sweetener
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:24.920]   in humans as well,
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:27.620]   although that still remains to be determined empirically.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:30.640]   So I'd like to just briefly recap what I've covered today.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.360]   I started off by talking about the structure and function
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:35.080]   of the gut brain axis.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.540]   I described the basic structure and function
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:39.520]   of the digestive pathway
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:42.820]   and how that digestive pathway harbors microbiota species,
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:45.240]   meaning many, many little bacteria
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:47.700]   that can signal all sorts of things
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:49.860]   to the rest of the brain and body.
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:51.460]   And indeed, we talked about the various ways
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:52.480]   that they do that.
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:54.460]   We talked about direct pathways,
[01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:57.400]   literally nerve networks that extend from the gut
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:00.400]   up to the brain and from the brain back to the gut.
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.880]   And we talked about indirect pathways,
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.820]   how some of the gut microbiota
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:06.980]   can actually synthesize neurotransmitters
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:08.480]   that get out into the bloodstream,
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:11.440]   can impact the body, can impact the immune system
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:13.120]   and can get into the brain
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:15.280]   and act as neurotransmitters in the brain,
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.440]   just as would neurotransmitters
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:19.500]   that originate from within the brain.
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:22.720]   We also talked about what constitutes
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.360]   a healthy versus unhealthy microbiome.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.400]   And it's very clear that having a diverse microbiome
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:32.800]   is healthier than having a non-diverse microbiome.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.700]   But as I pointed out, there's still a lot of questions
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:38.860]   as to exactly what microbiota species you want to enhance
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:41.300]   and which ones you want to suppress in the gut
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:44.460]   in order to achieve the best gut brain access function.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:47.080]   We talked about how things like fasting
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:48.720]   might impact the microbiome
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:51.160]   and how some of that might be a little bit counterintuitive
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:54.040]   based on some of the other positive effects of fasting,
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.160]   or if we're not just discussing fasting,
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.840]   some other types of somewhat restrictive diets,
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:00.100]   either restrictive in time
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:02.920]   or restrictive in terms of macronutrient intake,
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:05.120]   how those may or may not improve
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.600]   the health of the gut microbiome.
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.400]   And the basic takeaway was that
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:11.420]   because we don't know exactly how specific diets
[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:13.040]   impact the gut microbiome,
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.040]   and we don't know how fasting
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:17.820]   either promotes or degrades the microbiome,
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:20.460]   we really can't say whether or not they are improving
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:22.920]   or degrading the microbiome at this time.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:25.880]   However, it is clear that stress,
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.100]   in particular chronic stress,
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:28.800]   can disrupt the gut microbiome.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:29.760]   It's also clear, of course,
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:32.440]   that antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome.
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:35.780]   And that brings us to the topic of prebiotics and probiotics.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:38.400]   And I emphasize the fact that for most people,
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.000]   ingesting high quality non-processed foods
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.680]   that includes some prebiotic fiber,
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:47.360]   but also that includes some probiotics
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.560]   will probably be healthy,
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.840]   but not excessive levels of probiotics.
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:52.820]   High levels of supplemented probiotics
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:54.540]   of the sort that would come in a probiotic pill
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:56.480]   or even prescription probiotics
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.400]   would probably lend themselves best
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:01.020]   to when people were under severe chronic stress
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:03.260]   or had just come off a serious round
[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:06.740]   or an ongoing or repeated rounds of antibiotics.
[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:09.400]   That does not mean that ingesting probiotics
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:11.520]   in any form or any kind is not good.
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:14.960]   It just means that the very high dose probiotics,
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.960]   again, typically found in prescription form
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.900]   or capsule pill form,
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:21.020]   probably are best reserved to cases where,
[01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:22.820]   of course, your doctor prescribes them.
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:24.720]   You should always follow your doctor's advice.
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.280]   But in cases where perhaps you are jet lagged,
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:29.760]   you're traveling excessively for any reason
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:32.240]   or working excessively, you're not getting enough sleep
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:35.200]   or your diet is radically changed from normal.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:38.220]   And we talked about how increasing the amount of fiber
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:39.880]   in your diet might be useful
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:43.080]   for increasing fiber digesting enzymes
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.240]   and the assimilation of fibrous foods,
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:48.000]   but that it's really the ingestion of fermented foods.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.040]   And in fact, getting anywhere from four
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:52.400]   or even up to six servings a day of fermented foods
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:53.980]   can be immensely beneficial
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:56.860]   for reducing inflammatory markers in the body
[01:47:56.860 --> 01:48:01.160]   and for improving microbiota diversity all along the gut
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:03.700]   and thereby improving signaling
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:07.620]   and outcomes along the gut brain axis.
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:11.020]   So we went all the way from structure to function
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:13.660]   to the four kinds of signaling, mechanical, chemical,
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:17.680]   indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, and fermented foods.
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:19.820]   And I tossed in a little bit at the end there
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:23.400]   also about ways that you can make your own fermented foods
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:25.680]   at home in order to try and offset some of the costs.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.300]   Also, it's just kind of fun to do.
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.560]   And some of those actually taste quite good.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:32.540]   I've actually found that the fermented sauerkraut
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:35.440]   that we're making at home actually rivals the sauerkraut
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:37.560]   that you can buy out of the refrigerated section
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.280]   at the grocery store.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:42.960]   And I am by no means a skilled cook or chef
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:45.600]   and basically have no culinary skill whatsoever.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.120]   So if I can do it, you can do it.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.040]   I hope you found this information useful
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.760]   and perhaps also actionable.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:55.240]   One of my motivations for doing this episode was again,
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:58.520]   as a primer for the episode with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg,
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:00.760]   where we go really deep into the gut microbiome,
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.560]   less so into the gut brain axis,
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:04.480]   but really deep into the gut microbiome,
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.560]   what it is, what it does, what it doesn't do,
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:08.560]   and some of the emerging findings from his lab
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.240]   that are yet to be published.
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:12.400]   And I also was excited to do this episode
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:14.400]   because I think many of us have heard
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:15.640]   about the gut microbiome.
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:17.880]   We hear about these bacteria that live in our gut.
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:19.560]   We hear about the gut brain axis
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.280]   or that 90% or more of the serotonin
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.760]   that we make is made in our gut.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:26.440]   We hear about the gut as a second brain and so forth.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.840]   But I think for many people,
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.660]   they don't really have a clear picture
[01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:32.400]   of what the gut microbiome is
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.960]   and the pathways and mechanisms
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:36.060]   by which it can signal to the brain
[01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:37.880]   and to the other parts of the body.
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:39.400]   So I hope that today's information
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.560]   at least improved the clarity around that topic
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.600]   and leaves you with a more vivid picture
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:48.180]   of this incredible system that is our gut brain axis.

[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.420]   at any level that you like.
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:30.780]   On many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:32.080]   we talk about supplements.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.280]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:36.720]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:38.760]   One of the key issues with supplements, however,
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:41.920]   is that the quality of supplements can vary tremendously.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:45.120]   And oftentimes that relates to the precision,
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.640]   or I should say the lack of precision
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:50.260]   with which companies put different amounts of supplements
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:53.040]   in the capsules and tablets than are listed on the bottle.
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:55.920]   For that reason, we partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.240]   because Thorne supplements have the highest degree
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:00.900]   of stringency in terms of the quality of ingredients
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:03.460]   and the specificity of the amounts of the ingredients.
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:05.200]   That is, what is listed on the bottle
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:06.640]   is actually what is contained
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:08.360]   in the capsules and tablets and powders.
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:10.400]   If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:15.400]   you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:18.380]   And there you can see the Thorne supplements that I take.
[01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:20.580]   You can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:22.920]   And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site,
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:25.560]   you can get 20% off any of the other supplements
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:26.500]   that Thorne makes.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:30.200]   That's thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:31.680]   And if you're not already following us

[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:41.040]   some of which overlap with the material covered
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.320]   on the podcast, and some of which is distinct
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.180]   from the material covered on the podcast.
