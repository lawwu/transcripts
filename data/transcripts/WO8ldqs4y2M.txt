[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.940]   - Thanks for listening to another week
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.560]   of the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.000]   We get a lot of really good questions via email
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.100]   and you can send those to us at
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.140]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.340]   As you can imagine, Pastor John,
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.860]   we have a lot of questions in the inbox
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.120]   about Target's new transgender bathroom policy.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.920]   Shoppers are now encouraged to use
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.400]   whichever gender bathrooms they identify with.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.180]   The Target corporate headquarters
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.160]   is just a short walk away from your house,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.800]   so this is pretty close to home.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.160]   On the principle of boycotts,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.560]   I think we've addressed this back in episode 430
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.240]   on corporate policies when we talked about
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.880]   Apple, Subaru, and Target back then.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.200]   What are the logistics though
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.320]   of Target's decision for Christians?
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.640]   If you're shopping at Target,
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.760]   you go to the bathroom and a woman
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.720]   identifying as a man walks in,
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.880]   are there any biblical principles at play here?
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.080]   Would you use a gender open restroom to begin with?
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.900]   Even if it says men on the door,
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.060]   how do you untangle this question?
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.700]   - Tony, the way my mind went on this
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.700]   may not be exactly where the question is going,
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.660]   although I'm gonna end precisely
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.100]   answering the question of what I would do.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.820]   But let me take you on the trajectory of my thought
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.380]   and trust that the Lord brought it to my mind
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.820]   for good reasons.
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.220]   Strange as it may sound,
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.200]   the first thing that comes to my mind
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.600]   as I hear the question
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.560]   is how parents are going to train their children
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.420]   in a culture where profound evil and deep corruption
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.420]   and God ignoring perversion is pervasive
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.700]   and accepted and defended and assumed
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.720]   and de-stigmatized and statistically normal.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.000]   That's just so front burner for me right now
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.920]   in conversations that I'm having.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.940]   For those of us who grew up
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.180]   where different standards were assumed
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.140]   and where some, at least external biblical patterns of life
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.600]   were normative, there is a built-in revulsion
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.900]   at some things that ought to produce revulsion.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.540]   But our children are not growing up in that world
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.780]   and they will not have the same instincts.
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.640]   So how, that's my question,
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.080]   how are we gonna raise them and train them
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   so that they will feel the exceeding sinfulness of sin
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.220]   and be willing to take stands that are extremely unpopular,
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.520]   maybe even costly or dangerous?
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.420]   And I think part of the answer to that question
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.380]   is whether we have a big enough doctrine
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.380]   of human depravity.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.020]   Are we able to take our children to the scriptures
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.820]   and explain to them in terms that are shocking enough
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.140]   where the evils of our society are coming from?
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.100]   The children are going to be told by the Supreme Court
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.260]   and by their teachers and by their friends
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.820]   that the world is a different way,
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.860]   that the words of the Supreme Court Justice
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.780]   Anthony Kennedy are true.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.820]   Here's this sentence, I'm gonna read right now,
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.400]   I think is probably the most destructive sentence,
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.220]   whether it's transgender or so-called gay marriage
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.940]   or abortion, this sentence from 1992,
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.720]   Justice Anthony Kennedy is probably
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.820]   the most destructive sentence that the court has ever spoken.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.420]   It'd be my guess, I've not read them all,
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.140]   but he said, "At the heart of liberty
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.140]   "is the right to define one's own concept of existence,
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.740]   "of meaning, of the universe,
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.540]   "and of the mystery of human life."
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.020]   Now, that view of human autonomy,
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.860]   defining one's own existence, is so widespread
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.140]   that unless we have a deeper, stronger,
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.020]   more compelling view of human nature
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.980]   that explains where such sentences come from,
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.340]   our children will simply be swept away
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.380]   and along with the culture.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.420]   So that's the first thing that comes to my mind.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.420]   I think just my first reaction when I hear another instance
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.420]   of the kind of application of Justice Kennedy's sentence
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.500]   is that the depths of the human heart's depravity
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.660]   must be built in profoundly to our children.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.700]   The second thing that comes to my mind
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.740]   is just to make sure that we have
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.980]   our terminology right in these days.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.980]   So Target has now put in place a policy
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.700]   and it goes like this.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.980]   It aims to give freedom to, quote,
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.920]   "transgender team members and guests
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.280]   "to use the restroom or fitting room facility
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.580]   "that corresponds with their gender identity."
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.460]   Now, there's the new term, gender identity,
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.180]   and it's just so important that all of our listeners
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.680]   get this, that's a new code word.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.680]   The word gender is now used not for biological reality
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.580]   of maleness or femaleness, but for desired identity
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.700]   of so-called male or so-called female,
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.280]   even if the biological reality is the opposite
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.880]   of the desired identity.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.860]   So gender identity can mean a male
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.020]   declaring himself to be female
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.660]   and a female declaring herself to be male.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.700]   That is what gender identity means.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.400]   And it's the most recent application
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   and perhaps the strangest of Justice Kennedy's principle,
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.620]   liberty is the right to define
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.920]   one's own concept of existence.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.620]   So we're gonna talk about polygamy one of these days
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.420]   and my wife was saying last night,
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.060]   "Well, that probably isn't coming."
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.580]   I said, "There's not a leg to stand on.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.960]   "Once you have put this sentence in place,
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.300]   "polygamy will come."
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.580]   And I mean, the worst has already come.
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.420]   Polygamy is a piece of cake.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.940]   That's coming, except that it's probably
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.980]   legally so complicated for inheritances
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.160]   and life insurance policies and everything else
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.060]   that maybe there'll be some breaks on it for a while anyway.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.400]   So this principle, for it to hold,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.960]   liberty is the right to define one's own existence,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.300]   God must be excluded from the picture
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.420]   because what it means to be God
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.380]   is that God defines for us the nature of our existence.
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.380]   And so the recent developments
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.620]   to presume we can define marriage
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.220]   any way we please and our sexual identity
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.820]   any way we please are manifestations
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.820]   of the human usurpation of divine prerogatives.
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.740]   This is not new, not a new thing.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.280]   This has been going on for a long time.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.140]   The correlation between biological maleness and femaleness
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.580]   and self-identification as male and female
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.500]   is rooted in numerous ways in the Bible.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.260]   It's rooted in God's creation as male and female.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.540]   It's rooted in distinct roles
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.380]   assigned to male and female in marriage.
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.580]   It's rooted in the biblical prohibition of homosexual acts.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.580]   So in answer to the last part of the question,
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.260]   would you, John Piper, use a gender open restroom
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.880]   even if it says men on the door,
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.820]   my answer is if I were there, and if I had to, I would,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.820]   just like I would stop on the highway if I had to,
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.580]   but I wouldn't if I didn't have to.
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.580]   And the reason I wouldn't is because I want there to be
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.660]   a small act of protest and life consistency
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.180]   that may have no impact at all on the powers
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.180]   that make such decisions, but that keep my conscience clear
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.500]   and acknowledge God in practical affairs
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.060]   and give a consistency to my life
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.140]   that does, I think, help overall
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.420]   in showing the way of Christ to the world.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.500]   And I would perhaps maybe say just one other thing.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.980]   I think we should spend most of our creative energies
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.780]   on constructing in our minds and in our hearts
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.060]   and in our families great and beautiful
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.140]   and glorious alternative visions of reality
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.020]   than the ones we're being offered by the world.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.020]   If we give most of our time to bemoaning
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.780]   and criticizing the world for acting like the world,
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.420]   our vision of God and his glorious future for his people
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.380]   will become smaller and smaller,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.320]   and that could be a greater tragedy
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.460]   than the one we're living in.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.980]   - Wow, yes, that is a critical point to end on.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.380]   No doubt there are follow-up questions
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.300]   from listeners on this.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.760]   You can send those in to us, and of course,
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.480]   you can search our archive of hundreds of episodes,
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.940]   download our podcast app, subscribe to the podcast,
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.260]   or even send us a question of your own.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.580]   Go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.860]   Tomorrow we talk about polygamy, as Pastor John alluded to,
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.740]   and a listener in Africa wants to know,
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.260]   can I have two wives?
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.000]   It's an important question we cannot and should not ignore,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.360]   and that is tomorrow.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.220]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.260]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.340]   with John Pfeiffer.
