[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]   I think most parents are kind of crash course testing their way through parenting, just
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.740]   like we are.
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.440]   There are a few things that I think have worked for us that I'll call out.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.100]   There have been moments where we're like, man, we have really figured out parenting.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.000]   Things are just feeling really smooth and everything's humming along.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.880]   And it feels like just as you start to really nail parenting, everything changes.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.500]   The developmental phases, the sleep regressions, sleep regressions, just variables in your
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.760]   external kind of kids' worlds that you can't control change.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.120]   And now you're dealing with a whole new set of interesting challenges.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.240]   So I think all this to say, just when you think you know it, it turns out you don't
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.240]   know it.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.680]   And you're having to relearn everything all over again in a very different way.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.160]   And so I think that's very normal and something that we've learned to accept over time.
