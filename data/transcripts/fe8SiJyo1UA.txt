[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   Artificial sweeteners are really problematic and the worrisome thing is they've snuck into
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.280]   everything, right? So people advertise like low sugar and you think, okay, this has less sugar,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.320]   but what they mean is it's got artificial sweetener in it. And the reason they don't
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.220]   contribute calories is because they're not absorbed in the small intestine. So they float
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.780]   on down to the colon where they get fermented by gut bacteria, but they get fermented into
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.480]   harmful post metabolic products, not healthy things like short chain fatty acids. And some
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.620]   of that too, they'll give you gas. If you've ever had like diabetic candy with a lot of artificial
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.720]   sweetener, one of the first things you'll see is, oh, I'm having terrible bloating and gas.
