[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   We address a lot of dating questions on the podcast, and those can be found in the podcast
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.680]   archive, all of them.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.440]   Today we add another to the list.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.320]   This question comes from a listener named Crystal, a not yet married woman with a question
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.760]   about her current boyfriend and what it means to be unequally yoked.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.760]   Here's Crystal's email.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.000]   "Dear Pastor John, thank you for your episodes.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.860]   I look forward to them every week.
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.600]   I would like to ask about the topic of being unequally yoked.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.980]   I am in a serious relationship that is headed towards marriage with a man who became a Christian,
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.260]   but he seems to take Christ a lot more casually than I do.
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.100]   I have shared with him my desire to build a Christ-centered family and have frequently
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.260]   tried to point him towards Christ.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.940]   He agrees, but from his actions it doesn't appear that Christ is truly number one in
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.940]   his heart.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.040]   I'm trying my best to encourage him to have greater reverence for God without coming off
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.420]   as judgmental, but I always have this nagging worry.
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.900]   Am I still obeying Christ by continuing this relationship when my boyfriend is less spiritually
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.580]   vibrant?
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.040]   Would that make us unequally yoked?
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.900]   In my circles, it seems like there are few single Christian men who are spiritually mature
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.300]   to choose from, and I suspect I'm not the only woman facing this dilemma."
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.460]   No, I suspect you're not.
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.420]   Let me rehearse what I just heard, because it's pretty bleak.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.620]   One, this young woman is in a relationship headed for marriage.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.620]   Two, she is dissatisfied with how casually her boyfriend takes Christ.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.780]   Three, she thinks his actions don't show that Christ is number one in his heart.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.740]   Four, she wishes he had greater reverence for God.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.820]   Five, she sees him as not spiritually vibrant.
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:58.060]   So, it sounds to me like she's very much aware of Paul's admonition in 1 Corinthians 7.39
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.420]   that Christians are only supposed to marry in the Lord, that is, marry other Christians,
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.760]   and she is trying to discern whether that clear line in the sand also implies that a
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.500]   serious Christian woman should not marry a lackadaisical Christian man.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.980]   Now, my short answer from the little I know of her case is, "No, she shouldn't."
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.260]   Now, let me give some reasons for why I would be so blunt and then back up with a slight
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.300]   qualification at the end.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.500]   So, let's start with 2 Thessalonians 3, verse 6.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   "Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.200]   from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.520]   you received from us."
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.560]   So there was this problem in Thessalonica that some of the church members, perhaps because
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.540]   they thought that the day of the Lord was so near, were not supporting themselves by
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.380]   work and were becoming busybodies and moochers in the church.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:20.420]   And Paul didn't jump to the conclusion that they were not Christians, not yet, but said—and
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.100]   he called it a command in the name of the Lord, no less, he strengthened it—that the
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:34.060]   other Christians in the church should keep away from the idlers, a kind of holy ostracism,
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.220]   in the hope that this might shame them and bring them to repentance and obedience.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:49.580]   Now the analogy I'm drawing between the disobedience involved in laziness and idleness at Thessalonica
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.620]   on the one hand and the kind of apparent spiritual lethargy in Crystal's boyfriend on the other
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.380]   hand is that there's disobedience on both parts.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.100]   He takes Christ and his word casually.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.260]   Christ doesn't seem to be number one in his heart.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.900]   He doesn't manifest serious reverence.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.980]   He doesn't have spiritual vitality.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.340]   Another word for that is disobedience.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.780]   He's disobeying the command of 2 Peter 3.18 to grow in the knowledge and the grace of
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.780]   God.
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.700]   He's disobeying the command of Revelation 3.16 that we should not be lukewarm lest Jesus
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.340]   spit us out of his mouth.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.060]   He's disobeying the command of Romans 12.11, "Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.100]   spirit."
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.660]   He's disobeying the command to serve the Lord with gladness.
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.120]   He's disobeying the command to be strong in the Lord and the strength of his might.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.220]   He's disobeying the command to love God with all his heart and all his soul and all his
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.980]   strength and all his mind, and the list could go on and on.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.460]   I cannot imagine Paul saying to the young women at Thessalonica, "Now, I'm calling the
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.860]   whole church to stand clear of Christian men who walk in idleness, but it's okay if you
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.680]   fall in love with one and marry him."
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.380]   You need to spend some serious time and see whether or not some changes come about to
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.660]   prove another kind of character.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.020]   Then consider what marriage actually is designed by God to be.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.460]   A man shall leave his mother and his father and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.860]   become one flesh, Genesis 2.24.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.140]   Something very profound is meant by the term "one flesh."
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:52.460]   That bodily union in sexual intercourse is the physical expression of a much deeper union
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.180]   of heart and soul pointing to the covenant relationship between Christ and the church.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.900]   Paul quotes that very text, Genesis 2.24, and then he says in Ephesians 5, "This mystery
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.580]   is profound, and I am saying it refers to Christ and the church."
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:21.100]   There isn't anything in human relationships comparable to the depth of the union of persons
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:30.260]   between a husband and a wife in covenant relation as they seek to reflect Christ and the church.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.860]   It's the profoundest of human relationships.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:41.300]   Therefore, a woman or a man contemplating marriage should take stock with the greatest
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:48.860]   seriousness, "Will I be able to pursue such a profound union of heart and mind and body
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.300]   with this other person?"
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.900]   And the last thing I would draw attention to is this.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:03.740]   A woman should be asking herself whether the man she is thinking about marrying is growing
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:11.500]   into the kind of maturity and character that will make him a responsible, Christlike spiritual
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.020]   leader in the home.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.660]   Women are not called in marriage to lead their poor, benighted husbands.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:28.580]   The Bible says that the husband is to be the head of his wife and their family.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:35.580]   There is a spiritual maturity, a strength of character that precedes this leadership.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.620]   That's what she should be looking for.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:44.140]   Here's where I said at the beginning I would give a slight qualification to my statement
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.780]   that Crystal should not pursue marriage with this man.
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.540]   The qualification is this.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:08:00.700]   It is quite possible that a man who is a newer believer may not yet have the biblical foundations
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:07.180]   or teaching that will enable him to grow into the kind of mature, responsible spiritual
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.300]   leader for which he's destined.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:20.460]   That means that a woman considering marriage to such a spiritually untried man must be
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:30.540]   very discerning concerning the kind of character traits she sees emerging in him, which may
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:38.340]   signal that he is or is not on his way to the wisdom and knowledge and strength and
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.780]   humility required for biblical headship in his family.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.100]   And here's the test I would encourage her to make.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:57.940]   Is he humbly eager and growing, or is he half-hearted and unresponsive, or is he resistant and defensive?
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.580]   I can see those three possibilities.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:08.100]   Humbly eager and growing, or half-hearted and unresponsive, or resistant and defensive.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:15.340]   Those are the three responses that I can see a young convert having as a Christian leader,
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:21.900]   like a pastor tries to help him, or Christian books are given to him, or a Christian girlfriend
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.860]   points him toward biblical maturity.
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:33.500]   I think it's possible for a spiritually wise woman to see emerging character traits of
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:39.980]   leadership and maturity and wisdom and humility and grace and strength as she watches him
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.060]   respond.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:49.460]   How does he respond to all the Christian input that he should be seeking and getting?
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:56.340]   If she sees eagerness and receptivity and responsiveness and growth, she may be encouraged
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.400]   to keep moving forward.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:05.780]   But if she sees unresponsiveness and laziness and lack of interest, lack of zeal, or worse,
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:12.620]   resistance and defensiveness, it seems to me she would be asking for a lifetime of frustration
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.820]   to move forward in that situation.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:23.460]   So, Crystal, may the Lord give you great wisdom and courage in this relationship.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:31.060]   Don't doubt God's good and wise and loving providence in your life if you should think
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.620]   it wise to put the brakes on this relationship.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.980]   God is for you as you walk in his will.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.980]   That's good.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.420]   So it seems it's better to remain unmarried than to marry a nominal, spiritually lethargic
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.420]   man, right?
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.420]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.420]   I would say that.
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.500]   And, you know, if we're going to talk about that in any detail, I would spend a good bit
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.980]   of time exalting the virtues and possibilities of singleness.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:02.260]   Because I think not enough has been made in the church with regard to helping single people
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.600]   get a vision for their life while they're single.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.500]   And that singleness may last a lifetime.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:16.500]   I mean, I can point to two or three remarkable older single women at Bethlehem over the years
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:24.780]   whose lives were absolutely stunning in their exemplary usefulness at every level—in families,
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:30.340]   among children, in Bible studies and Bible teaching and service and overseas.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:37.420]   And if a woman, or a man for that matter, gets a hold of the calling that Paul really
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:43.260]   envisioned for his own singleness, I don't think they would view the absence of marriage
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.100]   as the catastrophe that some believe it is.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.100]   But I mean, I love marriage.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:54.380]   I think marriage is God's ordinary way forward for the human race, but not for everybody.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:02.020]   So yeah, the answer to that question in my mind is better to be a godly, fruitful, obedient,
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:11.500]   devoted single than a person who's constantly regretting that my partner just doesn't seem
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:20.080]   to get it spiritually, and they remain a kind of nominal spiritual dud all their lives.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.060]   Another thing to say that we shouldn't be taking this much time to say, but another
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.940]   thing to say is, if your marriage is such a person, you should be.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.380]   I mean, people ask me, "How do you know if you're married to the right person?"
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.380]   The answer is, look at the name on the marriage certificate.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.500]   That's the answer.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:43.420]   God doesn't encourage divorce because one partner is an unbeliever or a dud, nominal
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.420]   believer.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:49.820]   You learn to grow in grace with what God has given you.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.820]   And there's an urgent call here too for men, single men, to be discipled and to be ready
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.940]   for marriage, and that's a whole other topic.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.940]   Oh my.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.460]   It is a whole other topic, and I hope any young men, single men listening would not
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:11.420]   mainly feel beat up on or discouraged, but rather say, "Okay, I've got a job description."
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:18.620]   If I am to think in terms of marriage long term, the Bible says think in terms of growing
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:28.700]   into the humble, Christlike, wise, strong, discerning, mature man that could lead a godly,
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.380]   mature, courageous, strong, articulate woman.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.760]   But that really is the way to think about life, I think.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:42.860]   If they're not devoted to singleness, the only kind of man a woman wants is a mature
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.980]   and godly man, and the only kind of woman a man wants is a mature and godly woman, and
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:54.940]   therefore the man has to press on to be her head.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.220]   And I would just qualify one thing here.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.780]   That may make some men think like, "Oh, I have to have as high an IQ, or I have to have
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.380]   the same grades in class."
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.380]   Well, that's not true.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.620]   That is not true.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:15.260]   You can be a godly, initiative-taking, loving, burden-bearing, protecting, providing leader
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.140]   with a wife who's a lot smarter than you are.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.340]   Yes, you can, and we could talk about that forever.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.620]   All right, let's shut this one down.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.620]   Thanks, Pastor John.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:28.700]   Speaking of this topic, in the marriage context, back in APJ 1549, we addressed this question,
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.340]   "My wife is more spiritual.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.340]   How do I lead her?"
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.820]   The outstanding episode that I remember off the top of my head, APJ 1549, that is in our
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:43.900]   podcast archive online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.460]   And speaking of marriage, from the first year of this podcast, we decided to address mature
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.220]   topics and awkward questions.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.060]   No apologies about that.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.500]   If you're comfortable asking it, we will address it.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.460]   Needless to say, Monday's question is a mature one for married couples, and I am your host,
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.460]   Tony Reinke.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.180]   We'll see you back here on Monday for that.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.420]   Until then, have a great weekend.
