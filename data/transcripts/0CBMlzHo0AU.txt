[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Hey, everybody, welcome back to the all in podcast with us
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.720]   again today, yawning from Milan, your favorite, the chairman
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.720]   dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya. You look a little tired, my
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.080]   friend. How you doing over there, buddy?
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   I left Monday, I flew to Singapore. I was on the ground
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.520]   for two days. And I flew here. I'm here for two days. And then
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.120]   I go to London. Five days. I'm exhausted.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.360]   You are on a whirlwind tour.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.440]   I mean, I'm flying around the world. Literally flying around
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.280]   the world. Moving west, man.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.720]   Right. I'm tired.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.080]   And this is all in service. I mean, at our age, you feel it.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.600]   It hits differently when you when you pass 40. And I'm
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   assuming this is 80-90 business. You're out there selling, you're
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.880]   selling, you're selling grok, you're selling 80-90, you're
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.720]   out there doing BD.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.640]   Little selling little closing. And then I'm speaking at the
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.080]   Oxford Union on Wednesday.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.440]   Okay, okay. Well, that sounds fancy.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.400]   Checking the bucket list.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.800]   Okay, there you have it.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.280]   And in his camo hat, and in his election afterglow, look at the
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.120]   glow. He is in that afterglow. He is post coitus here post
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.680]   election.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.960]   Anybody got a cigarette? I need to I need to light up a
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.520]   cigarette.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.640]   That was a close one. I didn't think I was going to make it,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.280]   but you did.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.200]   Do you like my camo hat, J-Cal?
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.800]   This is, this is the hat.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.920]   Well, it says Trump fans on it.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.160]   You look like Elmer Fudd. What does it say? You're hunting
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.960]   libs.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.880]   No, remember, remember when Tim Walz rolled out the camo hat?
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.680]   And you said it was going to win the election for Harris Walz?
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.400]   It might. It might. I thought that he might have a shot. Yes.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.680]   No, I was wrong about that one. Be bowie bowie quiet.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.840]   We got all the camo guys. They voted for us.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.160]   Hunting liberals. Nobody's gonna get this impersonation,
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.360]   but it's very good. It looks good.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.320]   Is that Elmer Fudd?
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.720]   That's Elmer Fudd. Be bowie bowie quiet. We're hunting liberals.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.400]   That sounds like Mike Tyson.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.760]   Well, I'm gonna mess up that. Jake Paul.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.080]   How about I wear a different Trump hat every week for the
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.880]   next four years?
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.320]   Absolutely fantastic. I mean, the ratings are so many good
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.360]   ones. I mean, all I care about at this point.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.280]   I'm getting savage in any way possible. All I care about is
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.560]   ratings now. Let's go.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.280]   You're fine.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.200]   MAGA. Get in the comments. Let's get these ratings up.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.920]   And with us, of course, the CEO of Ohalo. Ohalo. David
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.160]   Freeburg. How are you doing, buddy?
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.000]   Thanks for having me again, Jacob. Thank you.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.560]   All right. Well, it's good to have you. It's good to be here.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.440]   Yeah. How are you doing?
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.440]   I'm chilling, man. You know, just nice to the executive
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.120]   producer to have you on the show.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.040]   Yes, I've been executive producing here.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.640]   Well, it's always I'm always thinking about your best
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.960]   interests. I was hearing a little I heard you on a phone
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.240]   call before you said you had a perfect body. What was that in
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.720]   reference to?
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.040]   My wife makes me go. Yeah, she makes me go to the
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.560]   dermatologist where they she examines your whole nude body
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.680]   to look for moles. So this morning, I went in early to the
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.360]   dermatologist. She examined it. She said, perfect. I said,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.000]   does she have to wear sunglasses? Because you're just
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.520]   so white. Like it just like it's blindingly white. She's a
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.680]   woman. She can hazard pay the poor that poor dermatologist.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.880]   My God, she's like, she's like, thank you for the experience.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.680]   But this is why we need to. In all seriousness, this is why
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.240]   sacks we have to legalize psychedelics. This poor woman
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.840]   has PTSD. After that, we need to get out of here. Get out of
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.720]   here. It was a wonderful examination. She was thrilled.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.480]   I mean, all right. Okay. And of course, I'm Jason canis.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.360]   And, you know, there's been a lot of scuttlebutt sacks. I
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.000]   don't know if you know this, but comedy might still be legal
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.560]   here on the olympicus. But there's been a lot of scuttlebutt
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.920]   a lot of debate, a lot of energy, dare I say around, are
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.880]   we going to break the rules today? Finally? I don't know.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.440]   We'll see anything's possible. People get a little sensitive
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.560]   sometimes with the car. Do I have to put my pronouns back in
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.960]   my zoom?
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.080]   pronouns back in shabbat. Polly happened to you, douche bag.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.560]   Here we go. You you might not know this, but a lot of
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.480]   appointments are being made sacks. Did you know this? Are
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.520]   you aware that the appointments are being made? I'm aware. Yeah,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.680]   it's happening. You'll have seen you've seen the flow of them.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.280]   Well, I got a dump. I'm not going to say who sent these to
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.400]   me. But I actually got the next five or six announcement that
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   Trump's going to make. I'm not going to say who gave to me.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.560]   This is this bit has the potential to be so good. I'm so
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.840]   tired, but you've got me awake. Okay, I'm awake. Well, I'm
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.920]   ready. Here's our first one. Here's our first one. This is a
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.320]   very interesting one. Good. Yeah, here it is. This is a
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.240]   statement from Donald J. Trump. It is my great honor to announce
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.920]   that under Biden of Delaware will head a new department, the
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.560]   Bureau of founder mode procurement, founder more
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.280]   procurement, you notice sacks dropped off. He doesn't want to
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.360]   have a reaction shot here. Next one up. This is interesting.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.240]   Tony Hinchcliffe. I don't know if you know him. He has been
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.120]   appointed to a new role. He's the ambassador to Puerto Rico.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.920]   That's a good one. Chamath. Actually, your wish has come
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.800]   true. You are now your sole duty is to ensure all executive
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.000]   branch knitwear is on point. The sweater Inspector General

[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.480]   Absolutely knitwear. And I just so you know, that's a that's a
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.120]   lower piano cashmere sweater in that picture. Apparently,
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.000]   apparently, I'm actually decided I would flip I've gone
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.720]   full Maggie. Here I am. I've been appointed as chief virtue

[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.200]   competition from Mark Cuban for that. For that post. I know I
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.480]   beat him out. I beat him. Yeah, I went down to me. He deleted
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   all of his pro Kamala tweets. Have you done the same? No, no,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.200]   I haven't yet. You're gonna get the job. Look at the lusty eyes
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.640]   in this. Yeah, I know. It's pretty great. That's really it
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.240]   really you you have there you have the virtue you didn't want
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.280]   to just burrow yourself. Absolutely not. Absolutely not.

[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.560]   lot of people who are out of line just a little bit. A little
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.040]   bit. They deserve to get smacked a little bit just on Graham's

[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.080]   All right, let's get into it. Everybody. I just want to start
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.160]   with a little bit of finance here. Bitcoin and finance stocks
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.120]   way up since the Trump win, which was now 10 days ago,
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.800]   Bitcoin peaked at 92,000. Unbelievable. It's dropped down
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:21.120]   to 89. But obviously, that's an all time high. And as we all
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.760]   know, we talked about it on the show, Trump heavily, heavily
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.720]   courted the crypto industry during his campaign. In
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.880]   addition to the Bitcoin news, since early August, a firm
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.400]   Robinhood, PayPal, Coinbase all up double, or 50%. It's an
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.560]   extraordinary run. In July, Trump headlined a Bitcoin
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.000]   conference, he laid out his plans. Number one, he was going
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   to fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Here's the clip.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.400]   On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler and appoint a new
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.360]   SEC Chairman.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:05.920]   I didn't know he was that unpopular.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.400]   I didn't know he was that unpopular. Let me say it again.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.760]   On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.840]   There it is. Okay, enough of that. Technically, president
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.120]   can't fire the SEC chair, but he can appoint a new one when
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.360]   Gary's term ends in 2026. Or Gary could resign and Trump
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.280]   takes office that happens sometimes. And folks are
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.080]   speculating Gensler has already made that decision to step
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.920]   down. He put out a press release with a quote in it that a
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.680]   number of people took note of, where he said it's been a great
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.480]   honor to serve with them, the people who work at the SEC,
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.440]   doing the people's work and ensuring our capital markets
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.800]   remain the best in the world. Trump also said the federal
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.320]   government will never sell, never ever sell its Bitcoin
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.520]   holdings, which they own through criminal assets, as you
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.560]   know. And number three, he said he would create a Bitcoin and
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.480]   crypto Presidential Advisory Council, where Trump said,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.840]   quote, the rules will be written by people who love your
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.040]   industry, not heat your industry. And he also advocated
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.520]   that all future bitcoins would be minted in America. I don't
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.920]   know that he gets to make that choice. But there have it
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.040]   freeberg. Any thoughts here on the crypto market, and this
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.280]   incredible bull run here we've seen in the last, you know, 10
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.520]   days, and then before that couple, I mean, I think like
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.880]   you said, it's not limited to crypto. Crypto is one market of
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.960]   several that have been significantly affected by the
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.840]   outlook based on Trump's election. I think that Trump's
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.760]   election has a couple of key features that are changing
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.840]   market dynamics. One is folks kind of view some of his
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.360]   policies to be obviously stimulatory, with lower tax
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.600]   rates and more deregulation. This is, you know, theoretically
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.400]   going to drive up investment and economic growth. The
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   deregulatory nature on its own benefits markets that have been
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.680]   encumbered by regulatory oversight and regulatory
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.520]   challenges like crypto finance and fintech. So those types of
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.440]   businesses are clearly going to benefit or expected to benefit
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.640]   significantly by being able to launch products more quickly
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.880]   and have features and ways that they can generate revenue that
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.360]   they might be challenged to do under the current regulatory
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.800]   schemas. And then there's also this element of kind of things
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.080]   being inflationary, the feature of tariffs, if we don't get
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.360]   spending cut fast enough, there's an effect on market. So
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.840]   you know, we're still seeing tenure treasury sit at about
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.400]   four and a half percent up from three and a half percent, which
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.040]   is where we were right around the rate cut beginning in
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.960]   September. And remember, since those rate cuts began in
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.480]   September, we've cut 75 basis points. And we're still seeing
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.080]   the kind of tenure treasury hold high, which kind of implies
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.280]   that there's expected to be persistent inflation. In fact,
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.800]   the October inflation number accelerated again. So it's back
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.040]   up, not going down, it's I think it went up to 2.6% up from 2.3%
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.840]   the month prior, these general kind of effects that are
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.360]   predicted from the Trump policy plans is having an effect in
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.080]   different markets, obviously, in equities, we're seeing more
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.880]   kind of risk seeking risk taking. And then in the bond
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.240]   markets, because of the four and a half percent treasury yield,
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.280]   there's a really interesting dynamic. And I kind of sent this
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:37.200]   this link out yesterday. But if you look at the spread on yields
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.240]   between US treasuries, which have historically been kind of
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.600]   considered and talked about and are deemed the risk free rate,
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.920]   and the yield that corporates have to pay to borrow money, we
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:56.080]   haven't seen a spread this low in 26 years. So it's a 17 year
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.640]   low for the spread between the yield that companies that issue
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.560]   junk bonds have to pay from treasuries. And it's a 26 year
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.880]   low for credit grade bonds. So this means the market is either
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.680]   more risk seeking, meaning they're looking for more yield,
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.840]   and they're going into corporates because they feel
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.880]   like there is a higher probability that these companies
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.640]   are going to be successful in the future, they're not going to
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.760]   have higher default rates, etc. So the market is becoming much
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.080]   more risk seeking. Or the alternative is that parts of the
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.880]   market are reassessing the risk free nature of treasuries
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.320]   themselves. If spending doesn't get under control, the treasury
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.600]   market appetite is decreasing. So there's this kind of spread
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.480]   that's shrunk in the last couple of months. So we're seeing
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.800]   capital flooding into the markets for risk seeking assets.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.320]   And this is obviously affecting crypto equities, and, and bond
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.960]   markets all across the board. And we'll talk a little bit
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.560]   about IPO and M&A later. Great. Chamath, your thoughts? Aside
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:57.760]   from yum yum? I mean, yum, yum, you could say it. It's gonna be
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.880]   just say it. No, I mean, look, what did I say at the beginning
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.920]   of the year was going to be the biggest risk asset? Winning
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.080]   trade? Yeah, it's great. Bitcoin's great. Lord, I haven't
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.880]   seen you this happy.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:21.280]   What made you more happy? Getting to Momon and spending
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.320]   time with your white truffle dealer? Or watching Bitcoin
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.920]   break 90k? Which one was more exciting for you?
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.200]   Honestly, you know what I think about? I actually think about
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.480]   all the Bitcoin I sold.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:40.400]   I had a bunch of Bitcoin in my funds when I managed outside
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.680]   capital. You know, that's a, I don't know, a $3 or $4 billion
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.960]   mistake and growing now, because my partners at the time
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   capitulated and I wanted to be a good team member and we
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.640]   distributed and it was profitable. But obviously, I
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.440]   shouldn't have sold it. Would have made them a lot more money.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.640]   And then I think about like, I bought some land. I remember
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.320]   Tahoe. It was in the Wall Street Journal. I'm sure you can find
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.800]   it. But yeah, how much is that worth now? Probably a couple
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.320]   hundred million dollars, maybe more.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.360]   Rough trade, rough trade. But you do have Bitcoin holdings.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.680]   Can I ask you a question? Why do you say sold Bitcoin, as
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.720]   opposed to converted Bitcoin into dollars? Like when you
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.960]   think about Bitcoin, just as a participant, do you think about
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.240]   Bitcoin as a dollar denominated asset that you go and buy
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.680]   Bitcoin and then you're eventually going to sell it,
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.400]   turn it back into dollars and use the dollars? Or are you
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.720]   like, what do you think about the purist kind of idea that
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.640]   Bitcoin should be the de facto currency and store of value in
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.040]   the future and the dollar doesn't matter. And we shouldn't
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.920]   necessarily be talking about the value of Bitcoin in dollar
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.240]   denominated terms as something I'm going to eventually turn it
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.120]   back into.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.080]   It hasn't happened yet. And so until it happens, I think you
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:02.000]   have to view it as like a very good gold proxy. But it's a
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.600]   largely dollar denominated asset.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.960]   Now, why do you see it going the other way? Like, so a lot
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.400]   of folks thought that as a safe haven, it should do well when
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.080]   there's a negative economic outlook, but it has traded the
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   last couple of years kind of the opposite.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.800]   No, it's a totally correlated asset. I mean, yeah, there will
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:31.360]   be a point. And it's probably in our lifetime, where it is an
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.640]   independent asset, and a non speculative store of value.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.040]   There will be that day, but that day is not now. And I think
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.720]   it's very important to see the conditions on the field as they
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.960]   are versus what you wish it to be. And, and the reason is that
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.640]   it allows you to risk manage more appropriately. Because if
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.880]   you don't see it, then when something happens to the dollar
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.960]   complex, good or bad, or when something happens to rates, good
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.920]   or bad, or when something stimulative happens, good or bad,
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.040]   you're not going to react properly if you're in the
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.560]   business of managing it as a risk asset. So if you're in the
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.280]   set it and forget it bucket, and there are some people, I think
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.400]   it's great. None of these conversations matter. But like
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.640]   most people, you're probably going to be motivated to do
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.200]   something. And I think if you're motivated to do something, or
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.240]   you have FOMO that stimulates you to do something, whatever
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.000]   the psychology is that leads you to action, it's probably
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.920]   important to just view things as they really are versus how you
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.400]   wish them to be. And so I think the purists may eventually be
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.240]   right, I think they will be right at some point in my
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.920]   lifetime, but they're not right now. And that's why these things
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.480]   are correlated. And the other the other thing I'll say just
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.840]   broadly about the market is, I think that there's a tremendous
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.400]   amount of optimism about the economy. I think that's why you
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.640]   see risk spreads get crushed. Definitely. Yeah. And I think
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.280]   that as long as we see the kind of prognostications that the
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.440]   Trump administration is putting out, I think people are going to
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.320]   be mostly bullish. I think the way that this trade turns around
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.440]   is when something actually breaks in terms of the inflation
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.160]   picture, or in terms of the deficit picture. And if those
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.280]   things look like going into 2025, that President Trump's
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.440]   actions are not going to be able to course correct it, then I
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.520]   think you're going to see people go massively risk off, which I
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.880]   think will not be great for markets, obviously, right now,
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.840]   we're not in that point.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.120]   And you don't think that tenure reflects that already at four
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.600]   and a half percent? I mean, that's showing some degree of
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.720]   inflation and concern about the deficit. Right? It's like,
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:59.200]   I think, I think the tenure could be at 7%. Yeah. What is
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.760]   four and a half percent mean? I mean, if you're if you're going
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:07.760]   to run 8% of GDP level deficits for the next four or five or six
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.720]   years? Yeah. You're going to have the tenure at seven to 8%.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.200]   That's just mathematical, right?
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:21.120]   facts, your thoughts on crypto before we get into IPOs and M&A,
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.000]   if and,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.920]   yeah, just on crypto, the House Republicans already passed a
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.120]   framework for crypto regulation earlier this year, it actually
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.720]   got 71 democrats to join it, it was called the financial
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.520]   innovation and technology for the 21st century actor fit 21.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.000]   And it would classify digital assets like crypto as commodities
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.600]   regulated by the CFTC. If the blockchain they run on is is
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.640]   quote, functional and decentralized. That's the key
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.320]   requirement. If their blockchain is functional, but not
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.600]   decentralized, then there'd be concerned securities and fall
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.280]   into the purview of the SEC. I think the the crypto industry
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.560]   basically wants a really clear line for knowing when they're a
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.160]   commodity, and they want commodities be governed, governed
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.280]   like all other commodities by the CFTC. So that's what the
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.240]   Republican bill would do. I think with the republicans now
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.360]   winning the Senate, the prospects for that bill to get
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.360]   enacted are now greatly improved, especially because
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.600]   Sherrod Brown, who used to run the banking committee just lost
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.720]   to Bernie Moreno, this was a seat in Ohio. Elizabeth Warren
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.840]   is still going to object to this legislation, but she's just
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.080]   going to have way less influence. And like you said,
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.480]   it's not clear that Gary Gensler is going to be sticking
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.480]   around very long at the SEC. So look, the bottom line here is
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.840]   that I think that we are close to having clear rules of the
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.200]   road codified by Congress, which is what the crypto industry's
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.960]   been asking for. And the days of Gensler terrorizing crypto
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.880]   companies by issuing Wells notices without clarifying what
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.920]   the rules are that he's in prosecuting, those days are
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.040]   about to be over. So I think this is why the crypto markets
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:01.600]   are rallying.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.680]   And so to your point, if it's centralized, or partially
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.720]   centralized, you're going to be a security. If you're
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.920]   decentralized, anybody can join the network, no one person
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.040]   controls the network. And I guess most people would consider
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.680]   that Bitcoin versus say, ripple, which is partially
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.240]   decentralized, but largely centralized. And that's going
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.400]   to be, I guess, the new rules of the road. In addition to that,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.560]   there are new rules that are being enforced that hopefully
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.520]   Trump's 21 passes, right? This bill is called 21. But I think
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.560]   much, much higher likelihood that it or something like it now
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.400]   can get through the Congress sense. Yeah.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.120]   And then there's also legislation that's already been
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.200]   enacted. That's there's multiple ways and multiple paths, but
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.960]   accredited investors, there's going to be a path to becoming
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.160]   an accredited investor with a test. So that is something that
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.800]   is also on the docket. We'll see if it happens. Let's talk about
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.920]   IPOs and M&A yum yum boys. Just a level set here with the
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.200]   audience. Here's the number of IPOs per year. And as you can
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.280]   see, the last three years have been some of the lowest since
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.520]   2008 and 2009. The Great Recession for those of you who
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.880]   are old enough to remember it. And if you look at VC, the
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.520]   number of distributions have been absolutely on the floor for
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.520]   the past three years. In fact, if you look at the
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.600]   distributions from 2022, through 2024, those three years
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.440]   combined, it's been around 200 billion, which is less than
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:41.040]   2019 in total. And with this year projected to be about 100
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.000]   billion in distributions, that's about 14% of the peak ZURP era.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.560]   When in 2021, we had $710 billion in distribution here. So
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.240]   the backroom buzz is that Donnie from Queens is going to
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.800]   make M&A great again. A couple of reasons there sacks the wrath
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:07.040]   of Lena Kahn's coming to an end. Mag seven, sitting on massive
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.320]   amounts of cash and that cash is growing as people have laid
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.240]   people off and they're focused on getting fit. Obviously, we
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.080]   all know the Fed did another quarter point cut last week,
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.480]   although some people maybe don't know that because it seems to
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.360]   have gotten lost in the election news. And psychologically, I
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.480]   think everybody's feeling very optimistic. So maybe these IPOs
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.760]   are back on the menu. Chamath, I don't know if you saw it, but
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.280]   Klarna just filed for their IPO. That's a Swedish fintech
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.160]   company. They were kind of the pioneers in buy now pay later.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.040]   What are the other IPOs we could see file in 2025 Databricks,
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.080]   Stripe, Wiz, Canva, Plaid, Rippling and Airtable. There's a
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.200]   long shot that people have been buzzing about. I don't have any
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.000]   inside information, but people have been speculating SpaceX
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.440]   could IPO Starlink, their Starlink unit. And if you want to
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.440]   get really crazy, Chamath, maybe there's a long shot that Sam
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.000]   Altman jumps the fence and decides he's going to take open
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.680]   AI public during this window that people expect to be
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.440]   opening. What do you think Chamath? What's going to happen
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.320]   here in terms of M&A and IPOs in 2025?
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:19.440]   I think it's going to still be pretty subdued. I don't think
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:25.440]   that you're going to see these crazy M&A deals that I think
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:33.120]   everybody is expecting. I also don't anticipate a lot of these
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.520]   big companies going public, at least in the first half of the
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.160]   year. And the only reason I say that is I just think that
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.400]   this year, and the first half of next year, what's the
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.600]   difference? The IPO market is what the IPO market is. And if
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.040]   the 10 year is back to, you know, four and a half, 5%,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.520]   that's not a compelling strategy for some SaaS company, or some
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.600]   internet business that didn't take an opportunity to go
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.520]   public when rates were at zero. So if you just look
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.480]   mathematically at what the actual fair value of these
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.160]   companies should be, I don't know, it's not like such a
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.240]   great IPO market. Then on the M&A side, if all you're doing
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.680]   is waiting for Lena Khan to not be there, to me, I think that
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.280]   that betrays what M&A is supposed to be, which is, you're
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.760]   supposed to underwrite some industrial logic from first
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.760]   principles where things are very accretive, and very
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:37.440]   accretive things should not hang by a thread on the emotional
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.280]   regulation or dysregulation of the FTC Commissioner.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.200]   So I kind of think that you would have seen some of this
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.640]   stuff already as well, if the industrial logic was so high.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.720]   And again, when rates are non trivially high, I just think
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.280]   that it's not the easiest thing in the world to pull off like a
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.400]   really big M&A event. Nor is it a really easy thing to pull off
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.920]   to pull off a huge IPO when Yeah, again, there's a reason why
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:07.360]   Warren Buffett has $325 billion sitting in T bills, making four
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.240]   and a half percent a year, he owns more T bills in the United
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.080]   States government, he's making about $15 billion a year in
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.600]   interest, when you can do that, with absolutely no risk. Again,
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.040]   relative to stocks, at least, yeah, what is this IPO going to
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.360]   give you two months, right? Like the 10 years at four and a
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.960]   half percent, you're basically paying 20 times cash flow to
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.800]   own a risk free bond, the US Treasury bond, or you can pay
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.400]   23 times to 30. Yeah, it's 30 times to own the S&P 500. Right
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.400]   now. It's so yeah, it's but but there is a lot of risk seeking
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.400]   shifting happening to math, right. So I mean, we talked
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.640]   about like some of the crypto stuff, some of the fintech
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.840]   stuff, deregulation, that the PE might seem high today. But if
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.600]   you forecast out 10 years for some of these businesses in a
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   deregulated, de taxed environment, or reduced tax
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.120]   reduced regulation environment, that the earnings should
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.720]   accelerate in a way that outpaces the multiple you're
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.360]   getting today, right. So I mean, this is part of why some
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.000]   of the fintech companies are ripping right now, why some of
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.560]   the finance companies are ripping right now, if under
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.280]   Trump, and the Republican control of the House and Senate,
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.120]   laws don't pass and regulations get reduced. Theoretically,
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.520]   earnings are going to rip. And you should pay a higher
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.840]   multiple today, because you're actually buying these things at
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.760]   eight to 10 times earnings five years from now. So there seems
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.080]   to be some risk appetite there. But I do agree with Chamath on
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.760]   the M&A point. If you think about what's gone on over the
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.000]   last couple of years, big hold on a second, can I ask you a
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.320]   question? Do you think that regulation is the reason why
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.720]   the SAS companies have never made $1 profit?
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.080]   No, no, I'm not talking about SAS. I'm not talking about SAS.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.240]   I'm talking about industrial companies. No, the fintech
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.880]   market. Right. So we were talking about fintech and some
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.920]   of these assets earlier. Some of these equities, it's a very
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.800]   narrow part of the economy, right? Like, if you look at
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.560]   brought like on a broad based basis, the 10s and 10s of
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.120]   trillions of dollars of market cap that exist. I do agree with
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.000]   you that deregulation benefits a bunch of those companies. But
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.960]   it benefits sort of the non tech businesses more than the tech
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.840]   businesses. The tech businesses right now are relatively lightly
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.560]   regulated. Yeah, I would think that it benefits pharma
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.840]   businesses, it benefits ag businesses, it benefits real
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.360]   estate companies, it benefits a whole a whole swath of the
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.680]   economy. But we've started to see that re rating. And maybe
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.400]   we'll see a lot more. So maybe Jason, the more nuanced answer
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.880]   to your question is the kind of M&A that I think you want to
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.280]   see that I mean, let's face it that we all want to see here
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.000]   because we all have a vested interest, which is really
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.040]   specifically tech M&A. I don't think that any of this
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.800]   deregulation particularly accelerates that but maybe a
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.440]   more nuanced take on this would be that these other more
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.200]   regulated parts of the economy could do well and catch up to
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.240]   some of the earnings potential or the forward pricing of the
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.920]   tech businesses. But again, now you get into this weird trade
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:11.360]   where you can buy steady cash flowing businesses that can
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.760]   grow in valuation as fast as a as a fast growing but money
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.880]   losing tech business. But then you trade both of those two
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.480]   things off and it has effectively the same yield as a
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.880]   tenure. What do you do? Yeah, yeah, I you know, I, I think
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.840]   there's a lot of backed up inventory, where venture
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.720]   capital is boards and founders, people who control and make
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.960]   these decisions on M&A if they would sell the company to a
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.760]   larger company. I think there's a lot of exhaustion in the
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.440]   market. And that will drive the capitulation on valuation.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.840]   What do you think the valuations will be? Yeah, exactly. Yeah,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.000]   why would I know? I'm watching it right now. I mean, you think
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.120]   Warren Buffett's gonna take 325 billion of cash? No, no, but I
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   do. I do these own stock. So I think in a pay in terms of a
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.000]   multiple, I think it'll be more like Salesforce or Microsoft or
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.920]   Google, or Amazon, getting off the sidelines, because they've
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.680]   looked at and said, you know what, the juice ain't worth the
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.040]   squeeze, we might as well put our efforts and our capital into
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.160]   buying big hardware, and building new products and
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.480]   services. But if they think, hey, I got a chance of pulling
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.440]   this through, I'm sitting on all this cash. What if I hit
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.800]   another YouTube and Instagram, you know, really great
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.040]   acquisitions that were transformative for those two
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.680]   companies meta would not be where it is right now, Facebook,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.400]   you know that well, Jamal, if they hadn't gotten Instagram,
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.360]   and certainly, you know, Friedberg as an alumni of Google,
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.840]   if they didn't get YouTube, it would be a completely different
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.240]   picture for that company right now. I think there's a lot of
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.280]   those acquisitions. I think there's a lot of those
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.600]   acquisitions that have been sitting there waiting, and I'm
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.040]   watching the secondary markets to your question, what's the
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.080]   discount going to be? The discount was last year, I kid
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.880]   you not 70 8090% off the last round for SAS companies. And
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.400]   this year, it's 20 or 30. I'm seeing this when I'm getting
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.520]   offers to buy our shares in some private SAS companies, some
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.760]   private fintech companies. And then I also think, if you're a
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:12.960]   CEO, and you watch Robin Hood, Uber, Reddit, DoorDash, and
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.640]   Instacart, those five have actually after getting a little
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.000]   bit of an ass kicking, when they first went out, they have all
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.600]   rebounded massively. And for the people who held on to their
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.160]   Reddit shares, Robin Hood shares, Uber shares, they have
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.240]   been rewarded massively, massively for having faith in,
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.360]   you know, through this storm. So I think those two things, the
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.720]   capitulation of all these boards and founders are going to say,
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.000]   you know what, let's take the haircut, let's go public. And
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.360]   let's tell our story and see if we can make it work as a public
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.000]   company. And then the people who feel one step weaker than
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.560]   that, I think they want to catch their chips. And they've been in
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.160]   some of these investments, Jamal, it's year 11 1213 14. For
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.800]   some of these private companies, there is capitulation on those
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.520]   boards, people are exhausted. So that I just I'm gonna, I'm gonna
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.840]   take the other side of the argument on this one, all kind
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.800]   of play along. So I think, and I'll disagree a little bit for
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.760]   a couple different reasons. These big tech companies, the
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.480]   ones that have had, you know, media businesses, or because
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.800]   remember, there's tech, that's tech, right? Nvidia does not
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.440]   have a media business. But there's been a conversation over
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.880]   the last couple of years, where we need to break up big tech has
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.960]   been kind of part of the conversation with the dams. And
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   now the republicans are coming in, and they're saying the same
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.600]   thing, we got to break up big tech. So there, I think, are a
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.080]   few of these companies, Google being one of them that are very
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.840]   much handicapped right now, with respect to what kind of M&A
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.160]   they can do without dealing with the regulatory sledgehammer
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.640]   coming down on them. So I don't think that those guys are buyers,
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.480]   Jay Cal, I don't think that Google's in a place right now
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.880]   where they can go out and make a bunch of acquisitions, they're
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.920]   going to do everything they can to avoid the regulatory
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.160]   sledgehammer that's coming their way. First, it was coming from
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.800]   the dams. Now it's coming from the new administration. There's
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.440]   a bunch of other companies, you know, that don't really fit that
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.160]   bill, like Microsoft probably doesn't fit that bill, Nvidia,
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.760]   Adobe, maybe they'll make some acquisitions, but I don't think
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.880]   it's as simple as well. We'll sell it a low price, we'll buy
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.760]   it a low price. I'm just not sure they really come to do that
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:13.120]   right with you. I completely agree. I think that these big
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:18.320]   tech companies will need to pay a pound of flesh for the
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.560]   deplatforming and the censorship that they did.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.760]   And there's a perfect time if we're going to go to the
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.280]   political angle to bring you in sacks, what are the vibes? My
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.200]   perception is Trump likes to win. And Trump wants to see the
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:36.240]   economy soar. That is his platform. He's a business guy. I
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.560]   think he wants to see fluidity. I know JD has been not a fan of
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.240]   like the Googles, etc. So maybe you could help us navigate this
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.520]   who's right here. What's the possibility of M&A becoming more
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.320]   vibrant in a Trump administration?
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.240]   Well, there's no question that in general, President Trump wants
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.680]   to have the most vibrant economy we can have. And I think to that
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:03.200]   end, you're going to see the end of this era of deceleration of
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.520]   regulatory capture and lawfare. I think all those things are
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:14.080]   over. I think that equities that have been straining or tamped
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.880]   down under the weight of these abuses, you see them ripping
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.440]   now, for example, Tesla, it's gone from roughly 250 to 320 a
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.800]   share just since the election. And you could call that the
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.600]   lawfare discount. I mean, that basically is the discount on
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.760]   Tesla stock because the market was pricing in the risk of
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.120]   retaliation. If the Republicans lost, there's a widespread
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:39.440]   belief that the democrats would go after Elon and his company.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.800]   So you can actually measure the lawfare discount based on
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.280]   some regulation, right? Because there's a lot of regulations
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.160]   around self driving, rocket ship launches, all those things
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.480]   he's involved in. There's a lot of regulation. There's this
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.400]   crazy thing where they they made some regulator made a put a
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.320]   headset on a seal. Did you see this to test the effect on
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.720]   loud noises? The sonic sonic booms? Yeah, this poor seal. Do
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.520]   you see this for sale?
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.640]   Don't do that to free bird. You don't know. Don't put it on
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.160]   the screen. Put it in post. Don't put on the screen. It's
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.600]   free bird. It's gonna anyway, so they subjected this poor seal
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.520]   to exactly the thing that they were worried would harm seals.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.640]   In any event, the seal seemed totally fine. It didn't. They
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.520]   torture sales to make a point. I got it. Yeah. Anyway, it's
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.920]   really crazy. So yeah, this crazy about this JD help us
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.440]   navigate. I know JD is the VP and then you have Trump is the
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.200]   CEO. Chamath pointed out maybe there's a little on the GOP
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:43.520]   anger resentment residual because of the you know, banning
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.560]   of Trump from YouTube and some of these other platforms. Do you
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.200]   think that makes its way into M&A or not?
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.240]   I guess sacks like, let me be specific to Jake house question.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.280]   Not all tech companies are the same in that point of view,
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.440]   right? And so like, yeah, tech M&A generally is a thing. But
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:03.440]   specifically the companies that have had social media platforms
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:08.720]   may be kind of in a different lens from a regulatory
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.360]   perspective. Is that fair? Yeah, I mean, look, I think that
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.280]   not everything Lena Khan did was bad. In fact, she definitely
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.680]   has some fans among the populist Republicans and yeah, you know,
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.800]   some of them who've spoken out on her behalf in various areas
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.320]   have been JD Vance, Matt Gaetz as well. She did do some good
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.440]   things. Specifically, she was willing to take on the big tech
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.680]   companies. I mean, companies like Amazon, Apple, Google,
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.080]   frankly, they just had a free ride for the last couple of
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.120]   decades where they're allowed to do anything. And she came in
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.360]   and said there's a new sheriff in town and she was actually
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.920]   willing to apply pressure on them to not engage in anti
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.040]   competitive tactics. So I think she deserves credit for that. I
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.880]   think she did change the conversation. I think that we've
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.360]   talked about on previous pods that perhaps there was not as
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.040]   targeted and surgical an approach was used. And as a
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.880]   result of that, it did have a chilling effect on M&A. And so
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.480]   it hurt the, you know, the small tech environment. And so I
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.880]   think that we need to fix that part of it. But I hope that
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.560]   whoever replaces Lena Khan will continue to apply pressure to
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.760]   big tech because they are monopolies, and they will abuse
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.920]   their power if they're allowed to, and they need to be
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.400]   controlled.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:31.360]   sacks, if you had to handicap the probability of a lawsuit or
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:39.680]   some kind of attempt to dismantle Google and Facebook,
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.440]   would those be the two companies at the top of your list? And how
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.320]   would you handicap that?
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.320]   So my view is that Google should be broken up. There's abundant
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.440]   reasons for that. There's at least three monopolies in that
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.600]   company. There's the search business, the advertising
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.040]   business and YouTube, I think they should be busted up. What
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:01.680]   are the odds that that happens? It's hard to say, but what are
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.080]   the odds that that is pursued in the next administration in some
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.920]   capacity, or at least investigated? I'd say hi. I'd
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.880]   say, Facebook or meta less, so I don't see the compelling need
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.920]   to, to bust them up. But quite frankly, I think the issue that
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.720]   meta is going to face is just there were a lot of abuses in
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.560]   terms of censoring the free speech rights of Americans. Now,
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.240]   I don't think that was all the company's idea. I think a lot of
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.320]   pressure was put on the company by the Biden administration. I
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.640]   think they wanted to do the right thing, and just didn't
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.160]   show enough backbone. I think
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.000]   it's Zuckerberg's been clear that he regrets it. Yeah. So I
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.560]   guess Anthony now he's like, Listen, I'm not gonna do it
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.160]   again. Yeah, he published a letter. And maybe it was done to
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.400]   some degree to inoculate himself against the result of this
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.160]   election. But I'd say, to his credit, it wasn't clear at all
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.880]   who's going to win the election when he put out that letter. And
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.200]   he basically said that he regretted the fact that meta had
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.680]   gone along with the censorship requests by the Biden
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.920]   administration. And he specifically referred to that
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.560]   whole Hunter Biden story that got censored in 2020. That was
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.600]   election interference. It was a completely true story by the New
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.720]   York Post that got censored by Big Tech at the request of these
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.480]   51 former intelligence officials who were lying through their
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.840]   teeth claiming it was Russian disinformation. So he clearly
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.440]   regrets going along with that. In any event, I think there are
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.640]   better ways of handling the speech issue on social networks
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:37.440]   than busting up Facebook. But I do think, though, that Congress
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.400]   should investigate or continue investigating what went
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.800]   wrong there. And what exactly is the involvement of the
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.720]   intelligence community and the deep state in the censorship
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.480]   requests that we saw exposed by the Twitter files? Remember,
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.360]   can I bring up something maybe tangential and you can react to
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.440]   this? Just speaking of kind of like censorship, and then just
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:05.200]   the media complex that we have. I saw today that Trump filed
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.800]   like a 10 or $15 billion lawsuit against the broadcast
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.920]   networks. Maybe this is old news, but I may and maybe I just
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.120]   saw the news headline go by on x I don't I don't know. Yeah, I
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.760]   saw it as well. Yeah, didn't. And then separately, with Bobby
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.920]   Kennedy's nomination to HHS, one of the things that he has said
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.600]   that he wants to put an end to is the advertising that pharma
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.160]   does on these broadcast stations. If you put these two
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.600]   things together, where you deprive these folks of their
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.040]   largest revenue source, and at the same time, they have to sort
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:45.040]   of like answer for censorship or manipulating content. It does,
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.400]   do you think that that changes the landscape of how all these
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.880]   companies behave in the future? Or how do you think that that
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.360]   plays out?
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.960]   Yeah, I mean, absolutely. So all right, let's take each one of
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.320]   those. So on the the broadcasters, and we've talked
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.680]   about this before the big broadcast networks, and their
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.600]   affiliates receive free spectrum licenses from the FCC,
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.720]   and they get some of the most valuable spectrum there is
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:13.280]   through those licenses in exchange for certain requirements
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.600]   that their broadcaster in the public interest, namely, they
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.040]   have to follow a fairness doctrine, which is supposed to
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:22.080]   mean that you give equal time to both candidates. Well, in the
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.640]   final weeks of this campaign, we saw some really egregious
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:29.200]   abuses. NBC brought on Kamala Harris, but not Donald Trump for
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.480]   a very favorable segment on Saturday Night Live the week
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:37.360]   before the election. Separately, you saw 60 Minutes deceptively
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.600]   edit an interview with Kamala Harris, where they actually took
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.320]   one of her answers from one question and put it as the
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.360]   answer to another question. I mean, really deceptive. So you
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:53.120]   have a couple of examples with both CBS and NBC, which were
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.840]   violating the equal time requirement. We're clearly
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.600]   working on behalf of the Kamala Harris campaign. And when you
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:04.480]   look at the coverage itself, this election was the most
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.120]   unequal in terms of favorable coverage, it was something like
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.960]   a 60 point difference. So something like Kamala Kamala
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.440]   Harris received 87% favorable coverage and Trump received
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.360]   something like 85% negative coverage. So it there's no way
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.080]   it was that according to you know, yeah, there's a it's a
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.640]   report by Brent Bezell's media watchdog group that's been
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.280]   around forever and it's been recording this stuff in every
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.040]   election for the last 30 years. In any event, I think that
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.600]   there's a very strong argument that the broadcasters have not
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.640]   been fair. That's a violation of their licensed requirements.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.680]   And we should be reevaluating their spectrum, especially
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.240]   because it's not the highest best use of the great irony of
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.400]   this, though, sex is that they have already been demolished. I
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.440]   don't know if you saw but a bunch of the anchors at CNN are
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.200]   not renewing because their advertising is so far off. That
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.680]   like Chris Wallace, I think was making 8 million a year, 9
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.000]   million a year. And he just said, I'm gonna go do podcasts
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.480]   because they think they lowballed his offer. And if they
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.680]   know, yeah, well, there's a bunch of advertising from pharma,
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.960]   which I think in some of these networks is a third or half. And
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.160]   that's all networks. That's from Fox to CNN, and every MSNBC,
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.800]   everybody combined. If they lose advertising from pharma, it's
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   over. Like these, those news networks are going to lose half
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   their revenue overnight. That would be a that would be a
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.440]   deathblow to your question. Yeah, well, let me let me get
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.640]   back to that. So just on CNN, and MSNBC, you're absolutely
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.800]   right that they're announcing a bunch of layoffs, their ratings
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.000]   are destroyed. I think they're down. MSNBC ratings are down
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.120]   like 50% since the election. What that tells me is that their
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:44.000]   own audience, right? Sorry, since the election? Yeah. And
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.040]   what that what that tells me is that their captive viewer base
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.560]   who's been tuning in for years to all of this TDS have has now
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.000]   realized that they were deceived by MSNBC, and they've
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.680]   lost credibility, even with their most fervent supporters.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.200]   So there's no question that CNN, MSNBC, they're hurting. Now,
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.080]   Jake, I'll just make one small modification. They do not
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.040]   receive, they do not have spectrum licenses from the FCC,
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.240]   right? Because their cable network, so they're in kind of a
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.040]   different bucket. They don't have to abide by the fairness
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.920]   doctrine that CBS and NBC do, right? But they have different
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.520]   problems. And to your point about pharma, there's absolutely
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.640]   no reason to be allowing pharma advertisements on these TV
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.880]   networks. The fact of the matter is that people who are
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:34.000]   viewing those networks can't buy you can't buy pharmaceuticals
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.040]   without a prescription, right? It's up to doctors to write you
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.400]   the prescription. And this is why most countries most Western
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.320]   countries prohibit pharma advertising on the networks. And
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.360]   I think Bobby Kennedy has a very strong argument that it would
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.880]   serve the public interest not to allow this. We don't allow
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.280]   advertisements for tobacco, right?
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.160]   So I guess the thing that doesn't make sense to me, sex is
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:04.480]   you're so such a First Amendment, absolutist and free
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:08.320]   speech app absolutist, isn't it? And I'm not saying it's my
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.120]   opinion. But you know, my my challenge to you would be is
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.920]   tell me about freedom of speech and expression in relation to
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.880]   being able to do advertising for these products? Well, I mean,
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.240]   aren't they aren't consumers smart enough to figure it out?
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.440]   The point of the advertising is, I think is not at the end of
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.160]   the day to influence consumers, because consumers can't buy
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   pharmaceuticals, they have to go. That's what they say in it.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.920]   Ask your doctor about the purpose of the advertising is to
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.360]   buy favorable coverage. That's the point. And there are many
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.280]   examples. Explain that. Well, there are many examples of
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.560]   people who've worked in these networks saying that they had a
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.440]   story that was negative about pharma companies. And that
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.920]   story got spiked because the pharma companies are the biggest
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.520]   advertisers. In fact, I think it was there was a story about
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:58.720]   Fox News. And who? Who's the guy? Roger Ailes?
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.920]   Well, there's been a number of stories. I know what you're
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.240]   talking about. There's been stories about Anderson Cooper.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.960]   Who's the the guy who does international coverage on the
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.240]   weekends? GPS is the name of a show. I'm drawing I can't
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.880]   remember right now read Zakaria. Thank you for reading
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.640]   Zakaria. Yes. I think a bunch of those shows were like literally
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.240]   brought to you by Pfizer brought to you by these things. And so
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.960]   those shows potentially would just go away. And then there
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.440]   were there was reporting on the number of times they would
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.640]   report on those companies. And it showed they didn't. So what
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.640]   do you think freeberg of should pharma companies be allowed to
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.040]   advertise to consumers to ask their doctors to ask them about
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:48.480]   Viagra? What's your take? He's thinking for those of you at
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.200]   home listening, he's giving a deep thought.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.600]   Well, he's thinking, Jake, let me just say, yeah, I think I
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.160]   think there is there is a free speech issue that has to be
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.640]   weighed. Okay. So I don't want to be totally dismissive of
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.200]   that. However, I think that the Viagra example is a is on the
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.520]   like far end of the spectrum of a drug that by, you know, by
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.760]   advertising it, you could actually get consumers to
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.880]   request it from their doctor, I don't think most drugs are like
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:16.800]   that. And I think my contention would be that the real reason
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.640]   they're paying all this massive advertising is not to influence
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.520]   consumers, but to influence the coverage that they get. And
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.960]   there is something very corrupt about that. And I think that
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.520]   Bobby Kennedy has a really strong point that if you were to
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.240]   remove that incentive that many people inside the industry have
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:38.240]   admitted exists, then you get much fairer coverage of these
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.440]   pharma companies, and we would actually get to be a healthier
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.080]   country, because you wouldn't allow them to basically
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.920]   manipulate the public debate. So that that's the argument.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:53.280]   Friberg, you want to chime in on it or no, I mean, I feel like
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.640]   there's some market correction that takes place here, which
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:01.040]   we're already seeing, which is the consumers are moving away,
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.080]   we just talked about moving away from cable news, moving
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.320]   away from legacy media, they don't trust it, the trust is at
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.680]   an all time low. I don't know if it's necessarily the
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.840]   government's job to determine who advertises what, where, how
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.040]   and why. I don't like the government having that sort of
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.680]   degree of authority, generally speaking, because it can then
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.640]   lead into the government having overreach and oversight to
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.480]   control entities that maybe are competitive with the government
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.280]   in different ways. I do believe that the the beef with big tech
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.360]   is a result of big tech's influence over the population
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.160]   where big government wants to have that degree of influence
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.480]   over the population. So it's actually a battle between
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.400]   government and private entities over who can influence the
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.600]   population, and who has the ability to control the
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.560]   narrative. And I think that the general concept that the
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.200]   government should be determining who advertises where, what, how
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.720]   and why is not a great one. And I don't think that consumers
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.840]   are dumb. I think that consumers are showing their
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.960]   proclivity for independent media and independent news
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.400]   sources, because they don't trust the influence that's been
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.280]   kind of imparted upon these other channels and these other
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.240]   sources. And they're moving away from it. So I don't know if
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.480]   it's as much kind of a regulatory question and big
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.160]   pharma needs to be affected. I think that the market to some
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.960]   degree does its job. I don't think the consumers are dumb. I
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.720]   will also just kind of counter one of sax's points, I think
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.240]   that there are drugs, like multiple sclerosis is a good
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.800]   example. There was a drug introduced a couple years ago
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.000]   called octopus, and it was a new therapy for multiple sclerosis
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.320]   that is extremely effective. It's a it's a really big step
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.640]   change in biological therapies. And a lot of people that were on
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.720]   Ms and have had Ms for decades, take kind of old school mall
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.760]   old school drugs that maybe aren't that effective. So to
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.760]   create awareness, and they're not regularly seeing their
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.920]   doctors, they may not go in and see their doctor every year like
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.880]   they're supposed to. So the pharma companies are creating
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.360]   awareness that there's this new modality in this new product
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.840]   that could help them to get them to go into the doctor's
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.720]   office. You know, so I don't want to say that these are all
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.760]   like evil, you know, trying to control and influence like
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.840]   there are good drugs that come to market, they are beneficial
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.920]   to people and people don't know about them. How else are they
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.560]   supposed to get that word out if they're not able to advertise?
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.000]   So I don't think that it's all like negative and all malicious,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.440]   you know, kind of behavior and manipulation of media. People,
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.880]   we all have the resources, we all have the capacity. And we
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.320]   are all likely very frequently going to doctors. Most people
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.520]   don't. And so most people that have chronic disease or have
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.440]   health issues, there has to be a mechanism for, you know, making
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.920]   them aware of new options, new alternatives, new products that
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.880]   are coming to market. So I'm not super, like putting my foot
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.040]   down saying pharma companies shouldn't be able to advertise
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.200]   shouldn't be able to buy media out there and put ads up and
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.600]   tell people about stuff that they've discovered or that
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.320]   they've invented, that's been regulated, that's been tested,
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.040]   that's been approved, and that works and can help save lives.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.760]   I think they should have the freedom and ability to do that.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.480]   So I think there's a there's a bit of a nuance here to how this
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.840]   gets handled, is my point.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:06.400]   Yeah, I mean, look, I'm not saying that there's no benefit
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.400]   at all to letting pharma companies advertise some
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.640]   products. I think the question you have to ask is, why is so
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:19.600]   much money going from pharma to these news outlets, because
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.800]   most of the products, you know, that you generally can't buy
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.760]   them. I'll tell you the reason. The reason is that the pharma
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.480]   companies make so much money off of government funded insurance
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:32.720]   programs. Let me just state that again. If we only had private
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.240]   insurance, or if consumers had to pay for their drugs and their
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:40.160]   therapies themselves, the cost of drugs would go way down. The
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.920]   reason the cost of drugs has gone way up is because so much
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.960]   of the government insurance programs don't negotiate drug
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.600]   prices. And there are all these middlemen and all these people
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.240]   that sit in between that have been regulated through
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.280]   regulatory capture into the system that has allowed an
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.080]   incredible inflation in the cost of drug prices. Therefore,
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.640]   there is a lot of money to kind of continue the capture of the
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.000]   system. I don't think that it is right. And I think that the
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.280]   free market generally or having a less regulatory captured
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.520]   market will allow an appropriate kind of pricing of therapies and
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.400]   appropriate kind of adjustment in the market, which doesn't
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.920]   exist today. So, so much money to kind of keep the market the
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.800]   way it is needs to kind of keep flowing. That's my sense of
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.200]   this. It's I don't think it's about bad drugs need to kind of
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.480]   stay in play. As much as it is this market's been allowed to
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.040]   inflate and the cost of health care and the cost of drugs has
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:33.520]   inflated in a way that's simply untenable. And it doesn't make
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.760]   sense. And I think that it's because of regulatory capture.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.560]   And I think that that needs to change. And I'm hopeful that it
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.440]   does. That's the second reason then to get the this form of
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.840]   money out of advertising, because you're basically
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.560]   explaining it as like a self looking ice cream cone. But
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.320]   again, there's another reason as well. I think that explains
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.520]   the sheer magnitude, which is this influence buying its
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:53.840]   influence.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.680]   To your point, sexism, that was what I was about to bring up,
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.760]   you know, there. It's very subtle, you're not going to have
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:06.080]   somebody at NBC, or CNN, or Fox come down and tell Tucker
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:10.080]   Carlson, or Rachel Maddow, or Anderson Cooper, hey, you can't
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.120]   cover the story. But there is a bunch of self censorship that
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.400]   occurs, I believe, where people just don't select certain
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.320]   stories to be on the docket. And they just shape the coverage.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.520]   So they might not say something positive or negative about
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.280]   Pfizer, or Johnson Johnson, whoever it is, they'll just
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.000]   avoid that story. And because these anchors are getting paid,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   or have been previously paid 10 10 million 25 million a year.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.520]   Do you think they're going to like, really go hard at Pfizer
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.840]   or somebody like that? No, they're just not going to I've
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.920]   been inside the machine. They just avoid those stories. Okay,
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:51.440]   let's keep going through the docket here. I think it was a
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.000]   pretty good conversation. I know, by the way, I just wanted
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.880]   to say to the Trump administration, if you want the
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:01.600]   economy to rip, let m&a rip. But my one caveat is is a really
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.240]   simple way to do this. If you're under a trillion dollar
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.600]   valuation, let those companies buy and sell each other because
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:11.120]   then we could go from a mag seven to a mag 70. That's where
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.440]   I think actually, it makes the most sense if you actually are
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.680]   concerned about the consolidation of power in the top
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:20.960]   seven, let them sit out acquiring more great companies
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.680]   and let the people under that who are the mid market cap
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.680]   companies, let them do the buying and selling because then
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.240]   you might have a mag eight, nine and 10 show up. That's not
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.360]   talking my book, it would be better for me Friedberg to let
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:33.440]   the mag seven participate because they can pay higher
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.760]   prices. They're not price sensitive. But I do think the
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.960]   mid market companies buying and selling would make a healthier
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.560]   environment for competition. So you think it sorry you think it
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:46.240]   creates more competition, which will that'll benefit and grow
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.280]   the economy? Well, look at it this way. If somebody wants to
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.320]   buy, let's say Waymo gets spun out, somebody wants to buy it,
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:58.320]   if Amazon can't buy it, and Tesla can't buy it, and Amazon
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:03.440]   can't buy it, but they could merge with Uber, Lyft, DoorDash,
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.000]   you know, all those mid Airbnb, if those companies could
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.720]   consolidate, can you imagine what would happen if Amazon
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:13.120]   couldn't buy those companies, but you could see Waymo spin
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.880]   out and then partner with DoorDash and partner with Airbnb
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.520]   and you had that as one company. Now you got a $400
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.240]   billion company that is nipping on the heels that is
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.280]   aggressively competing with Amazon. That's what you want in
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.480]   the market is more competition for the mag seven, you don't
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.600]   want the magnificent seven to run away with it. And we could
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.000]   create the eighth, ninth and 10. So just imagine that
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.760]   Friedberg there was a another trillion dollar company like I
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.520]   actually I think Tesla just became a trillion dollar
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.920]   company again. So now that they're up in those ranks,
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:47.520]   great. Don't let Tesla don't let Amazon, etc. Nvidia buy more
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.160]   companies, let those that mergers and acquisitions and
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.280]   that strength happen under the trillion dollar mark. What do
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.720]   you think of that general concept?
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:58.960]   Yeah, I generally think competition is good. I generally
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.880]   think free market should be allowed to operate. And I've
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.000]   shared my point of view, I think bigger is going to drive more
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.680]   innovation than lots of little. So okay, again, Waymo wouldn't
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.480]   exist if not for Google plowing billions and billions. And I
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.720]   don't know about you guys. I took Waymo around the city
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.800]   yesterday. Pretty sick. Like it is legit. I don't go to the
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:22.320]   city. Yeah. It's pretty legit. And I think that's a toxic
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.000]   cesspool. And by the way, I will say my other comment is I
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.680]   think San Francisco has gotten 10x better. Now that I've been
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.240]   working downtown the last week or two, 10x better from a toxic
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.440]   cesspool just being a cesspool. I think part of the fat part of
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.720]   the reason is all of Walgreens is gone. There's no Walgreens
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:44.160]   left. You can't buy deodorant. Problem solved. There's nowhere
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.200]   to do crime anymore. How do you buy a drugstore that doesn't
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.160]   exist in San Francisco? How do you do that? You gotta ask
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:54.480]   Jason. Jason, how do you get an Amazon package delivered? Yeah,
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.240]   I don't. Hey, man, I'm in Texas. You can do whatever you want
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.320]   here. Jason gets his supplies air dropped in once a month.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.960]   What are you talking about? I'm bullish on the San Francisco
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:08.000]   turnaround because I think Daniel Lurie getting elected
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.200]   mayor was huge and this doesn't get really as much attention,
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:14.720]   but it's very important. The board shifted. The radicals got
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:17.520]   voted off the board of supervisors. So the board of
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.840]   supervisors are less progressive. Daniel's in the
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.200]   mayoral office. Good progress. And I think I think the city's
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.560]   already like turning around. I've been super blown away the
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.480]   last couple of weeks I've been downtown. I'm like, why am I
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.360]   not working downtown every day? It's actually really nice. It
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.920]   feels like San Francisco 20 years ago. Let's see. I'm
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.640]   pretty bullish. Yeah. I mean, safety is the number one thing.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.120]   If they can and this budget needs to get put under control,
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.080]   San Francisco spends one and a half X per capita of what New
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.440]   York City spends and that's something that Daniel and his
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.000]   team have kind of said they're gonna address sort of like
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.720]   their own doge and there's a team going in there to address
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.720]   this. So, I'm really bullish on what's gonna happen with the
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:56.560]   city. It's just such a great place. It seems like the power
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.840]   resides in the supervisors and they seem to have flipped two or
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.400]   three of the really lunatic ones, right? Sax, they got rid
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:07.200]   of Dopey Dean Preston. Who was the other guy? Peskin. Peskin,
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:10.560]   he was an idiot and they, those guys are done. So, that's
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.600]   progress. Do you wanna talk about the Trump candidates,
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.960]   Jayco? Yeah, let's get to that in a second but before we get
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.320]   to that, FBI raided the home of Polly Market CEO, Shane
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:24.400]   Copeland. He was on the election night stream. He was
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:28.560]   raided on Wednesday, November 13th, 8 days after the election.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:31.440]   They say Polly Market is Bloomberg says Polly Market is
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.760]   being investigated for allegedly accepting trades from
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:38.080]   US based users. Here's the backstory. In 2022, Polly
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.320]   Market paid 1.4 million to settle a case with the CFTC for
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:47.600]   offering option contracts without proper designation. The
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.240]   Commodity Futures Trading Commission also ordered the
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.840]   company to prevent US traders from making bets. They recently
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:55.840]   said Polly Market that is that they had taken additional
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.880]   measures to block Americans from trading. At the same time,
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:01.760]   Cali and Robin Hood were able to offer presidential prediction
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.880]   markets because Cali, it seems like they won their lawsuit
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:09.440]   against the CFTC last month. So, that allowed some betting
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.760]   markets to happen but Polly Market is still banned from the
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:15.200]   US because of that settlement in 2022. Here's the Polly Market
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:20.000]   claim. They claim the raid was obviously political retribution
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.320]   by the outgoing administration against Polly Market for
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.920]   providing a market that correctly called the 2024
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:29.600]   presidential election and Shane posted on X, discouraging that
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.640]   the current administration would seek a last ditch effort to go
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.200]   after companies they deem to be associated with political
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.240]   opponents. Bunch of conspiracy theories flying around. Peter
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:42.480]   Thiel and Founder Fund have made an investment into the company
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:48.080]   and Nate Silver is an advisor. I guess I'll just point out two
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.840]   things. They're much more accurate than Nate. Yeah. So,
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:54.480]   how manipulative can it be if they've got everything right?
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.920]   Yeah, I mean, that's literally the point I was about to make
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.040]   and I'll just end with this and then give it to you, Sachs for
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.720]   red meat. Americans are not allowed to participate in a lot
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.400]   of different markets and these kind of actions have been taken
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.840]   many, many, many times as we all know, poker, crypto, real
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.800]   estate, and prediction markets have all had actions like this
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.160]   taken against them and they typically are a speedy ticket.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.000]   The offices too or just his house?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Just his house according to the information we have right now.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.880]   They bust into his house at 6am and they took his phone.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.320]   Yeah, by the way, shout out to like, like if you're breaking
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.600]   the law, why wouldn't they?
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:39.280]   All that TBD offices. Yeah, it's a great, great speculation
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.880]   and important to note this action came after the election
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:47.440]   is resolved. So it's obvious the FBI knew that doing this
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:51.280]   beforehand would be seen as political and doing it after I
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.760]   don't know what I'm saying the decision. No, I know what you're
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.960]   saying. I'm adding something else, which is they obviously
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.400]   knew to be political sacks. And so they did it after they knew
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.040]   if they did it before that would be looked like, you know,
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.240]   really bad that the prediction mark that's predicting Trump a
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.480]   Trump win was rated. So they did it after. What do you think
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.960]   sacks? What's going on? Okay, I think it's political or not, I
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.400]   guess we don't know what was driving this. It's certainly an
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.680]   extreme action to bust into someone's home at 6am. But the
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.360]   FBI and take take your phone. So it's very curious. I think
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.120]   there's three theories that I've heard that I think could
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.320]   explain this. And I want to just be very clear that there's no
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.760]   proof on any of this. It's just a speculation. Yeah, it's a
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.360]   speculation going on. Yeah. But by the way, just before I get
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.920]   into it, I think Shane Copeland had one of the funniest tweets
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.400]   I've ever seen. New phone. Who dis? New phone? Who dis? Next?
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.360]   You should show them. I mean, that was like ballsy. The FBI
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.680]   bus in your house takes your phone. And that's the first
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.000]   thing you tweet. This is a that means that this is probably not
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.200]   a serious situation. But anyway, go ahead. Well, who knows? But
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.120]   yeah. Or he's confident is what I would say. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.040]   theory number one is that what the feds are looking for is
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.120]   whether any domestic whales were illegally wagering on the
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.200]   election outcome because theoretically, the money is all
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.160]   supposed to be offshore because domestic wagering on the
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:20.000]   election was illegal. However, a court ruled just days before
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.920]   the election that domestic wagering was legal. So that's a
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.760]   theory number one doesn't really make a lot of sense
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.640]   because the FBI would be enforcing a rule or a law that
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.760]   the courts had just overruled just days before the election.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.280]   So but that's theory number one. Theory number two, and this
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.040]   theory was raised by Fortune magazine, is that this that
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.640]   poly market was rife with what's called wash trading, which is a
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.360]   form of market manipulation, where shares are bought and
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.520]   sold often simultaneously, and repeatedly by the same people
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.560]   to create a false impression of volume and activity of
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.240]   liquidity. This is illegal in the US. And it does occur in
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.280]   crypto markets. So they could have been going after that. But
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.560]   again, it does seem like a very extreme thing to bust into his
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.480]   house. Why don't you just ask Shane? What authority would the
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.160]   US government have if it's all offshore in that context? I
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.280]   don't know. I'm just laying out possible theories. But
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.640]   fortune magazine did did raise that theory. But again, if
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.080]   that's what your claim is just subpoena poly market during
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.480]   business hours, I don't know why you need to raid the guy's
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.080]   home or raid the office, right where the files are. Right. And
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.840]   now let me let me lay out theory number three, okay, which is
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.720]   going to be a little bit controversial. But get the tip
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.440]   well, if if somebody was manipulating the sites, okay,
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.600]   then on whose behalf were they doing it, and what you'd have
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.080]   to say is that they were doing it on behalf of the Kamala
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.640]   campaign. Because in the last few days of the election, there
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.560]   was a weird blip where poly market and and calcium,
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.360]   especially calcium, even more than poly market, all of a
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.200]   sudden flipped to Kamala. And you can see this, particularly
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.920]   in Pennsylvania, where all of a sudden there was a big flip at
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.440]   the end, away from Trump towards Kamala that turned out to be
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:13.760]   totally fake. And Trump won Pennsylvania pretty, pretty
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.800]   handily. And so you got to wonder, well, wait a second, was
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.120]   a combo supporter, maybe trying to push the narrative that there
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.560]   was a last minute surge to Kamala, because that's what the
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.960]   action seemed to imply. And remember that the same time this
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.280]   was happening, there was a big, there was like a media push to
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.240]   create a narrative by her supporters in the media that
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.160]   there was a late break for Harris. Yes, by independents.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.240]   And so you have to kind of wonder, was somebody trying to
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.000]   push the prediction markets at the last minute to feed a media
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.160]   narrative that they were trying to create? Look, I have no
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.520]   evidence of this whatsoever. But the the action in the betting
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.520]   markets and the narrative they're trying to create in the
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:59.200]   media do line up. So if somebody was going to investigate
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.400]   election manipulation, this is what they should look into.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:07.360]   Chamath, you have any thoughts here? No, zero thoughts. I mean,
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.960]   yeah, you know, my thoughts on an error. I don't see him ever
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:15.440]   doing anything risky or illegal. So it makes no sense to me. I'm
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:21.040]   guessing that somebody made him aware, pure speculation of
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:24.160]   something in the system. And that probably was on his phone.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.640]   And they probably wanted to get that. And it's probably like a
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:32.080]   speeding ticket, ticky tacky thing. And you're just have the
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.640]   law still working its way through the system because they
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.400]   sacks were under an order to not take us, but Cal, she had
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.840]   gotten the mark, the law changed with their successful lawsuit,
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.600]   or they had defended their their case. So I would say it's all
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:50.320]   allegedly folks. And so wait for more information is always a
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:55.760]   good idea. All right, Trump is building his team. And it's a
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.400]   long list. We've got, I guess, dozens of names right now. So
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.880]   let's start with the four. Who's your favorite Jacob? Well, my
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.120]   opinion probably doesn't matter all that much. But let me go
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.760]   with the four that are creating a buzz tomorrow. Let's let's
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.920]   create the let's go with the four that are having the most
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.720]   buzz. And then I'll let you each tell me what you think you
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.720]   love. The one Yeah, there is one actually I love but let's I'll
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.120]   say who's that I'm curious. I'm genuinely curious. The fake and
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.960]   Ilan doing doge is my absolute favorite. Yes. Anything else
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:38.640]   that I am fascinated by Bobby Kennedy, going in and trying to
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.840]   make the country healthier and the country is the most sick
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:46.960]   country think of all of the Western countries and I think
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.600]   our food system has massive problems. So I'm very excited
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:54.160]   to see what he does inside of the Health and Human Services
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.800]   Department. I think it's a little bit controversial,
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.080]   obviously, but I don't see how it could be any worse than what
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.480]   we currently have. How do you feel about that? Who's your
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.480]   favorite? I guess we can just go with people's favorites if you
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.760]   want to go that way. The way I interpret his cabinet picks is
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.120]   that he's creating a coalition. So I view it more as like a
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.240]   package deal. J. Cal, I'm not going to pick out one or two,
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.880]   although I do have my favorites. The person who I
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.320]   think very astutely understands what Trump is trying to do is
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.400]   Charlie Kirk, who's a major influencer on the Republican
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:32.240]   side. And he says that, that what Maha, which is make
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.280]   America healthy again, they get RFK, Bobby Kennedy, HHS,
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.200]   obviously, the libertarians get Tulsi at DNI, I would add to
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.520]   that that they also get Ilan of a vague at doge. The base, the
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.960]   populist base gets Matt Gaetz, they get heck Seth at do D, they
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.840]   get home and, and then the piece through projecting strength
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.160]   crowd, which is kind of a nice name for neocon gets Rubio as
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.080]   Secretary of State and Stefanik at the UN. So I think that Trump
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:04.320]   is basically trying to have his cabinet reflect the diversity of
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.080]   views within the Republican Party. He's not decisively
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.320]   choosing one side over another. What this means is that during
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.280]   his presidency, he's going to get all the views and all the
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:18.320]   options within the collective view. That's an interesting
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.360]   way. Let's go point by point to the most controversial ones.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.360]   Matt Gaetz is obviously the most controversial attorney, though.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.760]   That's what they are all young. That's another trend. Yeah. And
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:31.440]   he has been put up as Attorney General. He has to be confirmed
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.320]   by the Senate. Obviously, he's the house rep from Florida,
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.280]   sacks. How qualified is he for this job on a scale of one to
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.600]   10? I think that Matt Gaetz would be a breath of fresh air
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:47.040]   at that DOJ. I mean, look, here's that the DOJ has been
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.120]   involved for the last eight or nine years in a completely
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.760]   fabricated effort to portray Donald Trump as an agent of the
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.600]   Russians. It started with the Steele dossier. They then opened
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.920]   an investigation based on that phony piece of opposition
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.760]   research funded by the Hillary campaign. They lied to the FISA
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:10.240]   court to spy on Donald Trump's campaign. They then worked with
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:16.000]   the various intelligence services and with the media to
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.040]   create this like hoax that went on for years and years. There's
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.960]   been no accountability for that. Furthermore, in the 2020
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.160]   election, you also had that effort to essentially cover up
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.320]   the 100 Biden hard drive that the FBI and DOJ were sitting on
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.200]   that for roughly a year. They created a phony story that it
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.360]   was Russian disinformation when it turned out to be completely
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.000]   authentic. So you believe there's a lot to clean up there?
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.640]   How qualified is he on a scale of one to 10? What the
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:49.600]   president, what the president ran on was that the DOJ needed
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:53.600]   to be de weaponized that it had been turned into a partisan
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.160]   political apparatus for the Democrats. I don't think anyone
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.160]   can argue with that at this point. I think the American
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.600]   people clearly bought into that argument. Now, in order to
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.600]   clean it up, you're gonna have to bring in a total outsider
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.280]   who's willing to break some eggs and shake things up. Is
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.840]   Matt Gaetz the only person who could do that? No, there are
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.840]   other people who could do it. But Matt Gaetz is definitely
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.720]   qualified for that role. He was one of the most outspoken
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.040]   critics in Congress of this weaponization of the FBI. He was
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.200]   never fooled by the Russiagate hoax. Most of the
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.800]   establishment was. And anybody who bought into the Russiagate
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.000]   hoax is not qualified to run the DOJ at this point.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.040]   Okay, any concerns?
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.960]   Well, there's a bunch of unproven smears and accusations
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.000]   have been made against him.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.240]   Any other concerns?
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.240]   Excuse me?
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.840]   Aside from the the the investigations and whatever in
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:42.480]   the smears,
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.480]   a bunch of unproven, yeah, smears and accusations were
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.400]   made against him. And my own view on that is that if there
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.120]   was really something there, I think Merrick Garland's DOJ
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.880]   would have acted on it two or three years ago. So I personally
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.920]   discount all these smears without there being any
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.120]   evidence whatsoever. And I think it's very predictable that
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.920]   what we're seeing with both Matt Gaetz and with Tulsi is that
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.920]   the worst accusations get made without any evidence in the
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:14.480]   media, when the blob or the establishment wants to stop a
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.520]   true populist reformer from cleaning up their backyard.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.600]   Freeberg, your thoughts on Matt Gaetz? And that seems to be
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.000]   the most controversial one. Any concerns? You think he's the
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.120]   most suited guy for the job?
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.040]   I don't want to comment on Matt Gaetz, but I'd like to talk
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:32.000]   about... Why not? Because I'd like to talk about a broader
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.600]   point of view on it. Okay.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:43.040]   So I think there's this kind of thing that happens in biology
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.360]   called evolution. And a lot of people think evolution is this
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.280]   continuous process, but it's not. Evolution is this process
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.560]   by which there is some significant growth for a period
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.800]   of time. And then there is an extinction event or an external
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.240]   force that causes what ultimately becomes what's called
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:03.200]   punctuated equilibrium. So the whole kind of system resets and
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:07.040]   then the healthier, stronger species survive and they grow
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.920]   and they persist. And if you look at the first chart, Nick,
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.880]   that I pulled up, this will just show you guys past extinction
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:19.040]   events, large amounts of biomass over the past half billion
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.480]   years get wiped out when these extinction events occur. And
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.360]   then evolution occurs because the species that can survive
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.640]   the extinction event persist in the environment and they grow.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.560]   And that's how evolution kind of actually takes place, is
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:36.000]   there's an external force that changes what survives and what
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.800]   doesn't. It's kind of a testing force. If you look at federal
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.760]   spending, and this is a crazy link, but here's federal
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.480]   spending over the last couple of decades. And I would argue
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.120]   that many of the agencies, much of the bureaucracy, many of the
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.920]   jobs created, many of the spending programs, many of the
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.360]   operating models, many of the behaviors can kind of be viewed
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.920]   as a species or species within this ecosystem that have kind of
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.760]   grown a lot over the last few decades. And I think what Trump's
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.280]   mandate was by the people, and people don't want to hear this
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.240]   and they don't like it, but his mandate was to be kind of the
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:17.040]   extinction event. And whatever agencies, whatever operating
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.200]   processes, whatever individuals, whatever bureaucratic systems
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.520]   exist within the federal government that can withstand
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.880]   the scrutiny of the individuals that Trump is going to put in
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.400]   charge of each of these agencies, that they can survive
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.120]   and they can come out the other end, there is certainly some
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.080]   degree of strength and resilience and hardiness. This is
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.680]   not about right or wrong. You say they deserve to exist if
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.000]   they can survive? I'm saying this is going to bring in the
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.680]   most disruptive force that federal agencies have ever seen.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.200]   And the intention with Trump isn't to find some person to
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.240]   keep running things the way they have been run in the past. His
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.800]   mandate from the people who elected him based on the message
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.680]   he put out there is to do the opposite, which is to go in and
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:01.200]   be as disruptive and damaging and destructive as possible. And
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.760]   whatever comes out the other side will be stronger, will be
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:10.240]   harder, and theoretically, will be, you know, more resilient.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.160]   And I think that that's the event that's underway. Now, the
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.440]   people who are getting exactly what they want in Trump's
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.880]   candidacies are the Democrats. They were saying Trump is going
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.120]   to put a bunch of crazy lunatics in office, and he's going to
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.240]   make them the cabinet, and now they're able to kind of clap
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.360]   their hands and say, "We told you so. We told you so." And I'm
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.080]   not sure that if they're really getting the message, which is
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.040]   that the intention here isn't to keep things running the way
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.240]   they have been running, but to really fundamentally test the
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.440]   systems and test the systems with the most challenging
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.560]   oppositional forces the systems have ever been tested by, which
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.480]   is the candidates or the individuals that he's putting in
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.440]   charge of each of these agencies. So, I'm not saying
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.840]   it's right or wrong one way or the other, but I'm making an
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.160]   observation that this is going to be kind of an extinction
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.280]   level event, that Trump's decisions on who he's putting
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.920]   in place, I think, are going to drive an outcome on the other
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:03.280]   end that's going to make the government look very different.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.120]   And, you know, I'm not going to sit around and say, "This
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.960]   person's good. This person's bad," because I don't think the
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.520]   point is to find someone that's, quote, "qualified to do the
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:13.200]   job." The intention is actually quite different, and the outcome
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.760]   may actually be positive for America if you fast forward a
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.080]   couple of years in some cases. And there's some cases where
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.000]   things could get really messed up, and people could suffer,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.800]   and jobs will be lost, and all sorts of bad things will happen.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.200]   But we cannot continue the way we have been with respect to
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.240]   federal spending, with respect to federal spending, bureaucracy
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:32.800]   and inefficiency in the federal government. And so something
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.200]   has to happen. And if this is the path by which this gets
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.880]   resolved in the limited window that's in front of this
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.800]   particular administration, which is probably two years,
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.200]   maybe four, maybe this is what has to happen.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.560]   Shabbat, where do you stand on Freiburg's interesting metaphor
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.640]   here that we're sending meteors into each of these departments
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.840]   to blow them up and see if they survive an extinction level
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.280]   event? I saw you nodding. Do you think this is an interesting
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:15:59.760]   framing?
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.320]   Great take. I have nothing to add to Freiburg's take.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.640]   Got it. Who's your favorite?
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:07.840]   You asked me the question, I answered. Who's your favorite?
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.640]   Well, I think let's take Elon and Vivek off the table,
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.520]   because that's an obvious one that we've all been behind
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.400]   since the beginning. Yeah. And we know and we all support the
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.640]   idea who's not against more efficiency. I mean, you have to
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.640]   be an idiot to be against efficiency. It's like the
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.320]   easiest one to say you love.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.640]   I think the highest beta pick so far has been Bobby Kennedy. I
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.160]   think the second highest beta pick is Matt gates.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.520]   Explain highest beta pick in this context, please.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.440]   I think the third is Tulsi Gabbard. That there is the
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.880]   potential for an enormously positive two or three sigma
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.960]   outcome. But there's also the chance that it can really not
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.600]   work. That was exactly why I picked Bobby Kennedy, because
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.920]   he's going to shake it up, right? Peter Thiel just did this
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.280]   podcast with Barry Weiss.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.280]   And it was fantastic, by the way, highly recommend.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.680]   Highly recommend. He's awesome. Yeah, the
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:04.000]   one of the great things he said is that he was talking about
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.560]   science, but I think the example works here as well, which is
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:10.160]   that we didn't have enough skepticism, and we had too much
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.400]   dogma. He was talking about sort of like the death of science.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.800]   And I think that that idea applies here as well, which is
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:23.360]   that the federal bureaucracy has not really been challenged.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:28.880]   And Vivek put out a very compelling post on x, where he
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.400]   basically said like, look, when you on the one hand, there's
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.080]   going to be radical transparency. But on the other
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.320]   hand, there's a lot of case law that we can use to kind of try
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.720]   to really dismantle the government apparatus. And they're
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.720]   putting themselves on a shot clock to do it by 2026 for the
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:53.520]   250th anniversary. So I think I'm really predisposed to this
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.640]   idea that it'll force the government to be very resilient
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.720]   at the end of this process. And I think that's a good thing. And
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.480]   it'll probably be very different than what it is on the way in.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.480]   And I think that that can be very positive.
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:10.960]   All right. So we got your mouth and myself actually giving some
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.920]   specific names that we thought were interesting. I'll go back
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:18.720]   to you sacks. Maybe I'll phrase it as to Chamath's phrasing,
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:22.240]   which one do you think has the greatest chance of creating a
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.440]   massive potential change that could be positive, but also has
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.160]   some possibility of a destructive downside. In other
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.200]   words, it could go either way. But man, if it goes the right
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.760]   way, it could be brilliant and amazing and great for all
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.320]   Americans, who would be your number one number two in that
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.120]   regard?
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:40.400]   Well, you have to identify what the potential downside is, I
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:44.560]   think the single biggest risk in a second Trump term is that
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.680]   somehow the United States gets into an unnecessary war, a war
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.880]   that we don't need another forever war. It's certainly not
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.400]   what President Trump wants. He's been abundantly clear on the
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.840]   campaign trail that he wants to avoid wars, he wants to avoid
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.040]   World War Three, it's clearly where all of his instincts are.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.120]   But the fact of the matter is, we have a very fraught and
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.520]   difficult international situation right now, the Middle
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:09.760]   East is on fire, we have a proxy war going on with Russia. So
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.640]   there is the chance that things could always spiral out of
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.480]   control. And you need, I think, within the cabinet, not just
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.840]   hawkish voices, but also dovish voices, so that the President
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.240]   has the full range of options at his disposal. And so in that
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.760]   sense, I would say that, you know, Tulsi is being one of the
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.160]   more dovish voices is incredibly critical, just to balance out
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.000]   some of the other voices who are more hawkish. And so in that
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.640]   sense, I think, you know, just making sure that the President
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.960]   gets to hear from a wide spectrum of views, I think that
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.160]   that part's very important.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.920]   So that would be Tulsi, Tulsi would be your pick for like,
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:50.160]   Yeah, just because like Tulsi could literally make the
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.360]   difference between whether we get in a unnecessary forever war
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.920]   or not. I would also just say that with respect to the other
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:02.080]   picks, there's obviously a lot of hysteria going on a lot of
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.360]   hyperbole about the downsides. I don't think it's going to be
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.400]   like a meteor hitting the earth. I don't think it's that
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.720]   destructive. I think that it's more like, will some eggs be
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.440]   broken up to make an omelet, right? That's, that's the
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.120]   analogy I would use rather than the meteor. And the thing I
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.080]   would just say is that we all agree the United States is
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.840]   currently on an unsustainable fiscal path. We know that we're
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.000]   spending too much money, we know that the bureaucracy is too
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.800]   big. What's the downside of shaking it up? There's just way
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.240]   more upside than downside in terms of shaking up this
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.000]   bureaucracy, because the current path is bankruptcy. Exactly. So
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.040]   why do we have to act like that it's so risky to bring in
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:46.720]   outsiders and populists and reformers into these agencies,
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:49.760]   we know there's going to be huge resistance to them. The
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.760]   biggest risk, frankly, is inertia taking over. And the
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.800]   reformers aren't able to do enough. And we all doing
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.200]   nothing is not an option. Yeah, and then we go bankrupt.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:03.520]   That's the big risk. Why is Chelsea getting attacked? What's
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.960]   the Russian people are saying? Like, I don't I don't know any
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.840]   of the history here. So tell me, it's obvious. It's because
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.760]   Washington is a very hawkish place. It's basically run by the
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.520]   war machine. There's there's no money going to Washington to
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:21.280]   lobby for peace. All the money in Washington is coming from
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.320]   the military industrial complex. So by definition,
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.520]   it's extremely hawkish, and it's geared towards war. And
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.560]   told us there's some history with Tulsi in Russia. Yeah, just
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.000]   to finish my point. Yeah. Tulsi has been one of the few
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.360]   consistent voices advocating for peace. So of course, the
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:40.960]   establishment wants to basically get her nomination
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:44.080]   vetoed. But again, I think you have to see the cabinet as a
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.840]   package deal. I think it's very important to have Tulsi as one
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:51.360]   voice for peace within a larger cabinet that already has many
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.240]   hawkish voices on it. Okay. All right, everybody for your
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:59.280]   sultan of science from Ohalo. David Freeberg, the chairman
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:04.960]   dictator Chamath Paihapatia from 8090. And David Sachs, from
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:08.960]   craft ventures. I am Jason kalachannis your host here at
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.640]   the all in podcast and this week in startups. We'll see you
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.320]   next time on the all in podcast. Bye bye back at you
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.600]   chief retribution officer.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:25.360]   Let your winners ride.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.920]   Rain Man David
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:34.640]   We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:35.680]   Love you.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:56.960]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.120]   orgy because they're all just useless. It's like this like
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.360]   sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:09.840]   What you're about to be. We need to get murky's are going
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:20.320]   on.
