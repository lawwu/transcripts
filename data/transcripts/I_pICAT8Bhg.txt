[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.080]   There are all of these benchmarks full of numbers.
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.280]   I don't like the numbers.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.760]   There are the leaderboards.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.840]   I'm kind of beginning to lose trust in the leaderboards as well.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.240]   So for my own work, I've been leaning increasingly
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.960]   into my own little benchmark, which started as a joke
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.680]   and has actually turned into something
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.840]   that I've learned quite a lot.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.480]   And that's this.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.120]   I prompt models with generate an SVG
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.000]   of a pelican riding a bicycle.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.560]   I have good reasons for this.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.240]   Firstly, these are not image models.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.080]   These are text models.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.920]   They shouldn't be able to draw anything at all.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.960]   But they can output code, and SVG is a kind of code.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.800]   So that works.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.720]   Fast forward to January.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.640]   And January, we get DeepSeek again.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.160]   DeepSeek strike back.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.600]   This is what happened to NVIDIA's stock price
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.320]   when DeepSeek R1 came out.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.080]   I think it was the 27th of January.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.600]   This was DeepSeek's first big reasoning model release.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.760]   Again, open weights.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.120]   They put it out to the world.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.680]   The Chinese labs were not supposed to be able to do this.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.040]   We have trading restrictions on the best GPUs
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.720]   to stop them getting their hands on them.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.920]   Turns out they'd figured out the tricks.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.480]   They'd figured out the efficiencies.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.960]   And yeah, the market kind of panicked.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.880]   And I believe this is a world record
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.880]   for the most a company has dropped in a single day.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.960]   That's a pretty frickin' good pelican.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.520]   I mean, the bicycle's gone a bit sort of cyberpunk.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.320]   But we are getting somewhere, right?
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.840]   And that pelican cost me like 4 and 1/2 cents.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.880]   So very exciting news on the pelican benchmark front
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.680]   with Gemini 2.5 Pro.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.920]   Also that month, I've got to throw a mention out to this.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.640]   OpenAI launched their GP--
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.680]   Another one, this came out of the Claude 4 system cards.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.240]   Claude 4 will rat you out to the feds.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.120]   If you expose it to evidence of malfeasance in your company,
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.040]   and you tell it it should act ethically,
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.840]   and you give it the ability to send email, it'll rat you out.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.800]   Blink and you miss it, they're on to me.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.120]   They found out to buy my pelican.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.640]   That was in the Google I/O keynote.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.880]   I'll have to switch to something else.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.180]   Thank you very much.
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.960]   I'm Simon Wilson, simonwilson.net, and that's my tool.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.160]   Thank you.
