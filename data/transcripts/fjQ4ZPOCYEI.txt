[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   So one of the most common complaints I hear from my listeners and readers is that they feel like they're too distracted.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   This is a problem they have at work. It is also a problem that many of you have in your life outside of work as well.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   When we study mismatches between the modern digital environment and our current lives,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   which is more or less the theme of this show, this distraction issue really is one of the big issues that we're dealing with.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Now we've talked about all sorts of different isolated aspects of distraction,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   where it comes from, the value of attention, reclaiming attention.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   We've talked about all sorts of isolated aspects about that on this show.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   But today I wanted to pull a bunch of those ideas together.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I have five big ideas about why you're probably too distracted,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   some of them about your life outside of work, some of them about your life in work.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And then for each of those ideas, we have some concrete responses to it.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   So if you recognize that source of distraction, if you recognize its dynamics, what can you do in response?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   All right, so that's our plan. Let's start with idea one.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   You use your phone as a stress reliever.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   So here's something I learned recently when I was going through first the acute recovery for my surgery,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   for my core issue, and now as I'm going through the rehab for my back because my back got messed up,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   because my core was injured, you know how those fun things unfold.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   One of the things I learned is that, oh, your phone can be a very powerful distractor stress reliever, right?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Because the type of content you get delivered through your phone,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   if you're a social media user, it'll be through social media.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   If it's me, it's going to be like news or baseball rumors.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It distracts you. It pushes emotional buttons.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   It's a bit of a sort of like a numbing palliative effect.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   In fact, when I was on the gurney waiting for my turn for surgery, which I was nervous about for obvious reasons,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I had my phone still, right? They don't take that till the end.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I was looking up on my phone, on Wikipedia, I was reading the technical details of the MIDI format.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I don't know if you know about this, Jesse, but the MIDI format that you use for digital music transmission,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   that was very soothing to me.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I was actually reading about the actual packet headers and payloads that have evolved for capturing digital music.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So I get this, right? I get that power.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So what I learned from this is that for a lot of people,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   this just becomes a default response for any stress or any boredom.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Because it sort of works.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It will put your mind somewhere else. It'll probably press an emotional cue.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And it gets you just that relief in the moment.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And again, it's not a bad thing in isolation, but when it becomes your default response to any sort of stress and boredom,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   when that becomes ingrained into your habit loops, when that reward system is pumping out the dopamine,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   every time it sees that phone nearby and you're a little bit uncomfortable,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   your life necessarily becomes very distracted.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You can't watch the television show you were looking forward to watching with your full attention.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   The phone pulls you in.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   You can't enjoy dinner with your family because the phone is pulling you in.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You can't finish that really hard essay or memo or piece of source code you're trying to write at your job
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   if that phone continues to pull you in.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   So we have a potentially positive use in isolation that when it becomes default,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   makes your life by default distracted.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   All right, so what is our concrete response to that particular dynamic?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You have to introduce systematically higher quality stress relievers into your life.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Build new habits about when I feel that stress.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I know it's built up. I'm stressed about what's going on at life or work.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I just want to pull out that phone.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   You have these other higher quality, more self-contained stress relievers.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It could be exercise.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It could be getting outside and doing a particular type of walk.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It could be making a certain type of tea.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Reading is a good one here.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   A particular type of books in particular locations that you like to read.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Hobby or hobby-related projects.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   You're retraining your mind, in particular your reward system,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   to give you dopamine around those high-quality alternatives.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   It will also bust the stress.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It will do so in a more durable way.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And because it's an activity that has its own intrinsic value,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   you are actually going to feel better about it,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   and it doesn't lead to a behavior loop that's going to affect other parts of your life.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Another thing you can do here is just train your mind to be more comfortable
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   with boredom or a mild amount of stress.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   You're just bored sometimes, and you can kind of just like take a deep breath
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   and slow down and be present.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That requires training, but it makes your mind more comfortable,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and so your reward system becomes less desperate to have some sort of dissipation
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   of those bad feelings.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   You're going to resist better this idea that I have this ready-made distraction ready to go.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   All right, idea number two, why you might be too distracted.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   In the context of work, you are playing obligation hot potato.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   This is an effect I've talked about before on the show,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   but I think it's critical for understanding a lot of the distraction
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   in the modern knowledge workplace.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   When you see a message arrive in your inbox or maybe in a chat window,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   but you see an incoming message that is sitting there,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   this can be a source of interpersonal stress because we say,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   "This is now an obligation on my plate.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Someone is waiting for me."
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   It kind of makes us a little uncomfortable.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Our instinct--this is the bad habit we've learned--is to want to get those things
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   out of these inboxes or channels as quickly as possible because that will,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   in the moment, relieve you of the cognitive burden of knowing
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   that this thing is your responsibility.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So what we do is we play obligation hot potato, which is what is the quickest way
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   that, technically speaking, this message or chat is out of my hands
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   and on someone else's plate.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And so you send it back with a question you made up.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   You know it's going to come back.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You're not getting to the heart of the issue.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   But temporarily, that's out of your inbox.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Someone's like, "I think we should meet about this."
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   You're like, "I don't want to deal with thinking through when I want to meet
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   or whatever.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I don't want to deal with my schedule, so how about--yeah, sure, we should.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   When's good for you?"
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Technically, that's out of your inbox for now.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It's coming back, but in the moment, it's out of here.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Or you put thoughts?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Shoot it back.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Or you send a couple of random thoughts.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   You know it's insufficient for what they're asking for, but in the moment,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   it's not there in your inbox waiting for you to see it.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   So it's just that drive, obligation hot potato, as I want to get stuff
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   out of my channels as quickly as possible.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   The problem with obligation hot potato is that these things come right back,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   and then you punt them back.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   When you're doing the bare minimum to get you out of your inbox,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   the total number of times that messages will arrive and command your attention
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   related to this particular issue goes up.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   You're punting it.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   They punt it back.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   You punt it.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   They punt it back.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   You're throwing the hot potato over there.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It burns their hands.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   They throw it over there.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It comes back to you.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   The total amount of time now that you are having to react to something
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   incoming goes up.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   The velocity of these things goes up because the granularity gets smaller,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   and, therefore, the responses have to be quicker.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And so, overall, your level of distraction,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   as captured by the amount of cognitive context shifting you have to do from
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   your work back to your communication channels, that skyrockets,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   all because in the moment when you are in an inbox,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   you just want to get things out of there as quickly as possible.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   So once you recognize the obligation hot potato dynamic,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   it gives you a concrete idea for solving this.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   How do we stop playing obligation hot potato?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Well, we're going to have to spend more time with our messages.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   So we're not doing the quickest thing.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   We're doing the thing that's going to be most effective.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Now I have a very specific definition of most effective here.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   What makes a reply effective?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It minimizes the number of follow-up messages you will have to receive
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   and respond to.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That's what matters.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   That's how you have to retrain your brain.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I don't care if it takes me 10 minutes versus 30 seconds to answer this
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   message right now.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   If the 10-minute response will minimize the number of future messages
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   just generates by a factor of three or four, it's worth it.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   If this 10-minute response means like we're basically done,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   that is worth it versus the one-minute response that's going to generate
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   a 10-message back and forth.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   So you want to start prioritizing the reduction of unscheduled messages
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   that you will have to receive and respond to.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   That is the thing you're trying to reduce, not the time in the moment.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   This means you're going to have to spend more time on your inbox,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   or in the time you do spend in your inbox,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   you're not going to get through as many messages,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   and maybe you will need even longer sessions or more sessions or stuff
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   that's just going to take longer for you to get to it.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   There is something that has to give when you're no longer playing
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Obligation Hot Potato, but it's better to have more frequent,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   more drawn-out inbox sessions than to have all this back and forth
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   communication all day long.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   A thing that can help here, this is like a bonus tip,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   a thing that can help here is if when you go into your inbox,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   you take a particular category of message,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   messages that are all of the same type.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Maybe they're all dealing with the same project or event,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   or they're all of the same type in the sense of these are all paperwork
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   or logistical questions, etc.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Take a bunch of questions of the same type,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   put them in their own folder or label,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   then just load up those messages and deal with those one after another.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It will be easier if the things you are dealing with consecutively,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   if they're all in the same cognitive context,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   it will be much less mentally exhausting to go through those messages.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Then you get another batch.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It's a mistake people make.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   When you're batching email, it's not just,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   "I'm going to batch the time in which I answer email."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   It's much better if you batch the content as well.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   It has much less of a cognitive drag.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   That will help.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   If you don't play obligation hot potato,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   your sessions are longer,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   but the times you're checking your inbox get much smaller.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   That's going to make your life feel a lot less distracted.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Hey, it's Cal Newport here.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I'm going to briefly interrupt the show to tell you about a website
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I'm excited about called Done Daily.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   At Done Daily, you are assigned a coach who checks in with you every day
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   to help you organize all you have to do
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   and make sure that you're getting the right things done.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   People will pay thousands per month for executive coaches
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   to give them exactly this feature,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   and Done Daily will give you those same capabilities
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   at a fraction of that price.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Now, this isn't my company,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   but they use a lot of the planning ideas I talk about here on the show,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   and I thought I would share it with you.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   DoneDaily.com, I think you'll like it.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Check it out if you get a chance.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   All right, let's go back to the show.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   All right, idea three.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   You're doing too many things at the same time.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   There's a core idea from my new--
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I guess I should call it new-ish book, Jesse,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   because we're coming up on the one-year anniversary.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   My new-ish book, Slow Productivity,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   A key idea from that book is overhead tax.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Every professional obligation you agree to
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   brings with it logistical overhead.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   It's emails, it's meetings, it's back and forth that you have to have,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   just to sort of organize and keep that obligation rolling.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   The more things you're working on at the same time,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   the more overhead tax you're paying at the same time.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   But that overhead tax, as it increases,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   what doesn't increase?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   The amount of time you have in the day.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So now the ratio of your time spent servicing work
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   versus actually doing work becomes unreasonable.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And this is another big source of feeling distracted all the time
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   is because if you have 10 ongoing obligations,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   that is a lot of overhead tax,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   and that overhead tax is pulling at your attention
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   because you're all generating emails and meetings
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   you have to jump in and out of and you feel really distracted.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   The concrete solution here is what I suggest in the book.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Do fewer things at once.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   This doesn't mean you're doing fewer things,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   you're accomplishing fewer things over a long timescale.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   You probably get more done per month or per year
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   if you do a few things at a time before you move on to the next.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   But in the moment, work on fewer things at once
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   so they can get more of your attention.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Less of your day is spent on overhead tax.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Those tasks will get completed faster
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   than you bring in the new ones.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   You'll be getting things done in a setting
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   that feels a lot less distracted and a lot less frustrating.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Idea number four, you're disorganized.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   If you have not organized well the obligations in your life,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   your life is going to feel distracted.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Because what's going to happen is
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   you're always discovering at the last minute,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   "Oh my God, this thing is due. I got to get this done.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I need to find these people. I'm making these calls.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I'm waiting to hear back. Where does this form go?"
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   There's going to be a sort of freneticism
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   that is induced when your life is disorganized.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Work gets consolidated around when it's due.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Often you have deadline conflicts
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   where multiple things are due around the same time
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   and you're all doing them at the last minute
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and now your day is incredibly back and forth
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   and you're staying up late
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   to try to make these things happen.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   There's always a sense of,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   "I need to be checking in on lots of channels
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   because God knows what I'm missing."
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   If you're not organized, reacting to things
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   becomes your main mode of force for your actual efforts.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   You have to constantly be checking things
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   because who knows what I'm missing.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   On the other hand, if you're organized,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   you know what you have to do
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   and you make smart decisions about when you're going to do it,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   all of that calms down
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   because you make better allocation of your available time.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   You can spread work out more evenly
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   so no one day is going to feel so overloaded.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   You can be more confident about being done with your workday
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   or during your workday being confident
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   when I'm working on this,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I don't need to be checking all the time for these other things
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   because I know what I'm doing
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   and I know my plan to do it.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   The more organized you are,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   the less distracted you're going to feel.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   The concrete suggestions here is
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   you got to get your act together
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   from an organizational perspective.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   At a minimum,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   you need some sort of task collection system.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I suggest using status boards
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   where you have a Trello-style board
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   for each of the roles
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   you have in your professional life
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   and then you divide it up into columns.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   You have like backburner,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   things you're working on this week,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   things you're waiting to hear back from people on, etc.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And then individual obligations
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   are stored in these columns as cards
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   on which you can then paste or attach or write
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   all of the relevant information.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   You need one of these type of status boards
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and you need to practice a full capture methodology
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   straight out of David Allen's book,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Getting Things Done,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   which means nothing is kept just in your head
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   at the end of every day as part of your shutdown.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   You have to make sure that anything is just in your head
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   gets onto one of those boards
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   or gets onto your calendar if it's time-specific,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   but it's not just in your head.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   You full capture
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   and you got to review that thing.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   At the very least,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   you need to be doing a weekly plan
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   where you grapple with your calendar for the week.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   You see what's coming up.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   You understand what's coming up.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   What deadlines are coming up.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   You move things around on your calendar.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Maybe I need to cancel this
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   or move this over here to make time.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   And you begin adding appointments with yourself
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   on your calendar to make sure
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   that for the time-sensitive things coming up,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   that you have enough time put aside to get it done
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and you're protecting that time.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Oh my God, this thing is due on Thursday.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Let me block off Monday afternoon
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   just to make sure that time doesn't get taken
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   because that's when I'm going to write this memo.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   When you do these weekly plans,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   it's when you really check in on those
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   and update those status boards at the very minimum.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   You could be looking at these more frequently,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   but at the very minimum.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   So capture and planning.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Capture and planning is what you need
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   to not feel like you're constantly distracted.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Now, if you get more advanced,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   we talked about on the show,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   a full multi-scale planning methodology
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   combined with these task boards,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   put all this together will be the best.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   But the very minimum,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   you need to be looking at your calendar once a week
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   and having some place
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   where all the things you need to do
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   that aren't on your calendar can live.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   All right, final idea for why you're so distracted.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   You lack sufficient foundational pursuits.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   So a foundational pursuit
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   is something that requires an investment of focus time
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   over a long period of time
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   and it's something you care about.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   You can have these in your work life.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   You can have these in your life outside of work.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   They're foundational
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   because you can sort of build your life on top of them
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   and there will be a certain stately pace to your life
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   and a certain resistance
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   to a sort of just random, frenetic distractedness.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   When you don't have these,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   your mind doesn't know what to do.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   So at work, it's like, let's just react to things.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   We need something to do.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Otherwise, we have no value to this office, right?
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   If we're not doing things,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   so let me jump on calls and answer emails
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   and be in the mix
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   and you lean towards distraction.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   And at home, you're like,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I don't know what to do with myself.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   I'm on my phone, video games.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I need something to do to fill my time
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   so that it feels more significant.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   So you need to have these foundational pursuits
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   so you do not fall into that sort of default distraction.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   So at work, that means you got to have some sort of project
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   in which you are regularly dedicating
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   long, deep work sessions towards.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Unbroken concentration towards something important.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   It's building a new skill.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   It's a new initiative, a new project.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   That's the foundation
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   on which you can build everything else in your work life.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   It's what's going to make you
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   be more resistant to the distraction and busyness.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   It's going to give you the courage
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   to push back or corral that
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   and not feel like you have no self-worth as an employee.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   At home, this is going to be significant hobbies,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   sort of reading challenge you're taking on,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   self-education goals, health projects,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   community involvement,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   something from that type of list.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   It's like a really big part of your life.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   In fact, I recommend people,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   especially the hustle types,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   work less to make sure you have
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   a foundational activity outside of your work.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   The counterbalance to work.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   It's that valuable.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Even if it means that's a couple more hours,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I could be crushing it.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And I'm not because I'm trying to run this community thing
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   or I have a really important like athletic physical pursuit
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   that's an important part of my life
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   and I want to train for it and do it.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   That is worth it.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   If you don't have that,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   the time that remains in your life
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   is going to be scattered and reactive.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   All right, so those were my four ideas
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   for why you might be too distracted.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   I'll list all five ideas.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I was distracted there.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Five ideas.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Idea one,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   it's because you're using your phone as a stress reliever.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Idea two,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   it's because you're playing too much Obligation Hot Potato.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Idea three,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   it's because you're doing too much at the same time.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Idea four,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   it's because you're disorganized.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Idea five,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   it's because you lack foundational pursuits
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   in both work and your life.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   So there we go.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   I think distraction of the type we're talking about
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   was less of a problem before the advent
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   of our modern digital environment,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   which to me,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   all the pieces that come together
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   for our modern digital environment
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   to make it what it is,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   it's digital technology plus digital networks.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   So we have internet technology
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   and we have this sort of accessibility
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   through devices like phones and tablets, etc.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   This idea that I'm distracted too much
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   was less of a problem
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   50 years ago or 100 years ago.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   It doesn't mean, though,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   that we can look at those times nostalgically, right?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   They had their own problems.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   If you go back 100 years,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   if we go back to 1926,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   what is the real issue going to be?
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   It's going to be people
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   who are in these newly industrialized workforces
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   where their job is grueling
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and is breaking down their body
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   and there's a sense of nihilism
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   and they're self-medicating
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   through excessive alcohol consumption
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   to the point where we get
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   the Women's Christian Temperance League
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   pushing through the prohibition
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   amendment to the Constitution.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   That's not better.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   It's just different.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Or we had similar in the '70s,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   we were all just watching television all the time,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   so it was terrible quality entertainment
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   with drinking our Schlitz beer.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   It's not like things were a panacea before.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And if anything,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   I actually see these mismatches
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   with the modern digital environment
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   and in particular this one of distraction.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   I'll take it.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Here's why.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   It's much more easily solvable.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Those type of solutions I gave
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   are not that hard
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   and they make your life better.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   So I'll just end on this idea
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   because I'm a technocritic.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I don't like this idea
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   that everything is always bad,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   everything is just making things worse,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   or there was a better time
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   that we're getting away from.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   We are always going to have problems
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   because of mismatches
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   between our culture
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   and our Paleolithic brain
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   and Neolithic way we run our lives.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   We're always going to have problems.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   The question is,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   are those problems getting easier
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   or harder to solve?
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And maybe there's some hope
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   that these modern digital environment problems
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   aren't going to be easier to solve.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   These jobs aren't particularly bad,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   for example.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   The people who are distracted
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   with email at work,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   they're going to an air-conditioned box
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   for like eight hours a day
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   doing non-physical labor
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   with a huge amount of autonomy.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   If you were in 1926,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   you would take that bet all day long.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I will do that.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   We're in a pretty good setup.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   We're just along the borders.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   The emails catch us up.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   We're too distracted.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   There's some nihilism.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Those are more solvable problems.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   I just want to add that coda.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   This is a relatively new problem,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   and it's a problem I'll take
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   because it is more solvable,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   and where we end up when we solve it
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   is so much better than where we were before.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I can still see an arc of progress
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   that we're progressing on.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   All right, Jesse, so there we go.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   That's why you're too distracted.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   - So when you were in the surgery
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   reading your phone,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   even though you were on social media,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   is that still technically a distraction
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   or can you kind of treat it like a book?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   - You know, I don't know
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   because it was random.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   I was looking for something
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   literally distracting.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   I wouldn't have had the energy
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   to really focus on something hard.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   We'll see in the book segment we do
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   at the end of today's episode.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   In the aftermath of that,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   when I was sort of laid up,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I read a lot of math books,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   which we'll talk about at the end,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   but I couldn't do that then
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   because I was really nervous.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Surgery is a weird thing.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   So I was just like, I don't know.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   It's like a random thing.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   That's why it's a distraction.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   My distractions are more nerdy,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   picking up technical protocols or whatever,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   but I felt like it was,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   but there it served a purpose.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I didn't need to be thinking about
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   what was about to happen.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   - But if you technically had
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   the Washington Post app on your phone?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   - I would have been distracting myself with it.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I wouldn't be like,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   I'm really interested in what's happening
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   in Congress.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I would have been like,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   I don't want to think about,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   maybe my stomach cut open.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   - Makes sense.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   - Yeah.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   All right, well,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   we got a great show coming up.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   We got some good questions,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   so let's hear from a sponsor.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   So I want to talk first
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   about our friends at Defender,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   particularly the Defender 90,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   the Defender 110,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   and the Defender 130,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   which seats up to eight line of vehicles.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   These were on my mind the other day
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   because friend of the show,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Brad Stolberg,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   was down in Miami,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   and he texted me a picture of a Defender.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It was a tricked out Defender.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   I think it was a 130,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   and it looked cool.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And he was saying,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   "Hey, when are we going to drive around
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   in one of these things and podcast?"
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   And I think that's actually not a bad idea.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   - It's not a bad idea.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   - Me and Stolberg just driving around
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   in our Defender.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Anyways, it was a really cool looking car.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   This one was tricked out.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   I think they had kitted it out with,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I don't know the terminology,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   but like the off-road type stuff,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   like the tire jack
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   and kind of the cool stuff.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   These are cool looking cars.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   You can see them,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   if you go to LandRoverUSA.com,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   you can see the three Defenders,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   and you can decide for yourselves
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   if Brad and I should tour the country
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   in one of these.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I think we should.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   This one, he sent me a picture of,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   they had tinted the windows,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   so it was extra Miami cool.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   (laughing)
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   I love it.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   We'll just have an arm up,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   just podcasting like it's an episode
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   of Comedian in Cars.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   But that would be cool.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   So anyways, I appreciated that he was
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   on the lookout for Defenders,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   because I don't know,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   it's a great looking car.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   It's got that great tech,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   but I just love the way it is.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   It just has cool lines.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And then like the cool,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   comfortable ride,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   and it has the great technology,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and you can drive it off road,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   and it has the camera that will show you
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   like what's under your car.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   You can avoid obstacles,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   and it looks nice in Miami.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   But I just love that idea,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   me and Brad just cruising,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   cruising in our Defender.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   So anyways, you can design your Defender
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   at LandRoverUSA.com.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Go there, check it out.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Let me know if you think
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   I should be cruising in one of those.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   You think maybe it'll be cooler
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   than my Kia Carnival minivan,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   which is black though.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   We have a black one.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   I think the Defender looks cooler.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   I also want to talk about a new sponsor,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   a high-tech sponsor for my IT,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   computer science folks out there.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   We all speak the same language.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   It's our friends at Vanta.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Here's the thing,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   trust isn't just earned,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   it's demanded.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Whether you're a startup founder,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   navigating your first audit,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   or a seasoned security professional,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   scaling your GRC program,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   proving your commitment to security
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   has never been more critical
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   or more complex.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   That's where Vanta comes in.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Businesses use Vanta to establish trust
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   by automating compliance needs
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   across over 35 frameworks
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   like SOC 2 and ISO 27001.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Centralized security workflows,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   they also help you complete questionnaires
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   up to five times faster
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and proactively manage vendor risk.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Man, when I first got started out
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   in computer programming,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   things were so simple.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   You would just build a program
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and have an exe file.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   But man, today's complicated world,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   all of this stuff matters.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   This is where Vanta comes in.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Vanta can help you start
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   or scale your security program
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   by connecting you with auditors
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   and experts to conduct your audit
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and set up your security program quickly.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Plus with automation and AI
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   throughout the platform,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Vanta gives you time back
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   so you can focus on building your company.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Join over 9,000 global companies
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   like Atlassian, Quora, and Factory
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   who use Vanta to manage risk
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and prove security in real time.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   All right, I got a deal.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Actually, I got two deals.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Deal number one,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   if Jesse can explain to me
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   what the ISO 27001 standard is,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I will give a visitor,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   I'll give a listener $10,000.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   - I can't.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   - Oh, sorry, listener.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   That would have been yours.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   I love these ads
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   that for people like me
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   who know startups and computer science,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   know all these buzzwords
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   and confuse normal people.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   I do have a better deal though.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   My listeners will get $1,000 off Vanta
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   if you go to vanta.com/deepquestions.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   So if you know what I'm talking about here,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   you know the things I'm referencing,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   then that means you should know about Vanta.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Best in class.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   You're gonna get $1,000 off
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   if you go to vanta.com/deepquestions.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   That's v-a-n-t-a.com/deepquestions
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   to get $1,000 off.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   That might be our best promo.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Is that the biggest promo amount
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   we've ever given for something?
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   - I think so.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   - All right.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Until next week's,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   if you go to landriverusa.com/deep,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   you get the first Defender for free.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   First Defender for free.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   But you gotta use the promo code.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   That'd be funny
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   if there's just a promo code
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   when you're signing your paperwork
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   to buy a new car.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   They just put down a sheet
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   with a box in the middle
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   and you write like deep 20.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   All right, enough of that.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Let's move on to our questions.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   - All right, first question's from Arnaud.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I'm developing a documentary film project
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   focused on environmental issues.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   I don't like social media,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   but started setting up Instagram and LinkedIn.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   I'd much prefer to have a solid newsletter.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   What should I do?
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   - All right, let me tell you the way,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   I've been refining my thinking.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Let me tell you the way
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I've been refining my thinking
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   when it comes to the use of these,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   let's call them, I don't know,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   digital attention or digital content tools.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Digital content tools is a good term.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   There's some points about this
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   that have been confusing to me
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   and I think I have a new framework
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   for thinking about this
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   that helps with those confusions.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   You can let me know if you buy this.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   When it comes to digital content tools
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   like namely social media and newsletters,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   maybe we could throw a podcast in there,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   but let's just talk about
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   social media and newsletters primarily.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   There are two different roles
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   these can play in helping you
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   with like the success of a project
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   or professional endeavor.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   And I think we get confused
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   when we mix these roles together.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   So let me pull these roles apart
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   and we'll see if this clarify things.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   All right, role number one.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Social media and newsletters
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   can be something that you can deploy
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   after something you're doing becomes successful
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   to help you magnify
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   or make more pervasive that success, right?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   So if you're doing something
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   like you're an author who hits a wave
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   and is getting a lot of attention,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   you have a startup that is buzzy,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   it's doing something
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   that people think is really interesting.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Your movie or your album
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   is like starting to gather attention
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   or has got some good reviews
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   and now suddenly everyone's paying attention.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Social media and newsletters in this circumstance
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   can be very helpful
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   for spreading or amplifying that success
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   and/or solidifying that audience.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   So for example,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   you might start putting up lots of social clips
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   that are shareable about your documentary
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   or relevant to your book.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And if people are really into it,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   they're going to share it
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   and that expands the reach
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   because you have people organically,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   authentically sharing stuff
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   that's about what you're doing.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   If you're an author
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   whose book is doing really well,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   well now you can solidify access
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   to that audience
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   by trying to capture them
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   on an email newsletter
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   where now you have a way
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   to actually talk to your audience directly.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   So that's a primary role these play.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   But that role requires first
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   that you're doing something that's successful
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   and then it's about
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   how do you professionally maximize
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   the opportunities that that creates.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   So in that situation,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   if you're working on your documentary
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   or film project
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   and it starts to take off,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   you want to make sure
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   you have pros in place
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   to sort of take advantage
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   of these possibilities
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   to help spread the word,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   to harness the energy
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   and harness the audience.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   The second role,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   technically,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   that social media newsletters can play
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   is as something that
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   builds an audience
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   and then deploys that audience
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   towards the primary project
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   you're working on
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   and makes that project more successful
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   than it otherwise would be.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   So it's like what makes
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   your project successful.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   This is where I think
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   a lot of people think about
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   using social media and newsletters.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   It's almost never successful.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Role two is almost never successful.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   So we mix these two things up.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   So it's not like
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   social media newsletters aren't important
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   and we see really successful projects
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   that really lean into this.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   But there's often
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   a chicken and egg inversion happening there.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   They're professionally
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   taking advantage of the audience
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   they've built through other means
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   as opposed to
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   they did something first
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   to build an audience
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   and then they used that
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   to make their primary project succeed.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And where you do see that happening,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   typically the primary project came later.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   This is someone who had success
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   in one of these realms.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Typically they had success in social media
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   and then they said,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   "Oh, why don't I do a project
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   to take advantage of that?"
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   And there there's
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   a big survivorship bias issue
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   because like most people
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   don't have success on these platforms.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   And those who do
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   are more likely to say,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   "Maybe I'll do a book."
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Like Sahil Bloom
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   has a book out right now
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   that's doing very well.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   He has a huge presence online.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   So the book is doing very well,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   but the huge presence online came first.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   The reason why that direction is
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   it's hard to deploy on demand.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   It's hard to say,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   "I have this primary project.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Let's go build a big newsletter
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   or social to help it,"
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   is that it's really hard
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   when you're not starting
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   with an already successful
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   brand name or project
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   to build a big social presence
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   or newsletter.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   If you look at like Substack,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   what's successful on Substack?
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I mean, it's almost always
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   people who already have
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   earned audience trust painstakingly.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   It's journalists.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   It's authors with successful books.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   I have a big newsletter.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   We got 125,000 people on it,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   something like that.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   That's because I've been writing books
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   for whatever it is now, 20 years,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   and have built trust
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   with a lot of audience
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   and then captured it.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Nate Silver makes a lot of money
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   off of his Substack,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   but he had a massively successful
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   journalistic career,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   especially at the New York Times
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   after his blog got taken up.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   People know him and follow him,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   so they followed him to Substack.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   It's very hard to do this from scratch.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   That's because these markets
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   are attention markets,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   and attention markets,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   especially when
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   these attention markets
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   are pretty efficient
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   and pretty competitive.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Why should someone
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   pay attention to you?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   That is a hard question to answer.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   And so what happens then
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   is people say,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   "Well, I did the stuff
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   you would do for role one."
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   On role one,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   if you have a successful book
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   and you want to use
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   media and newsletters,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   you're like,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   "I'm going to systematically
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   make clips about my book,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   and I'm going to very carefully
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   have my web presences
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   ask for newsletter subscribers,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   and because people
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   are really into me
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   and what I'm doing,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   that will help spread
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   and will gather a lot of people."
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   So they'll be like,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   "I'll do that,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   but for my unknown project,"
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   and nothing happens
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   because the clips you're making
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   about your project,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   no one cares about
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   if they don't already know
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   about your project.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   And your newsletter
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   that you have all these
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   sign-up widgets for,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   no one wants to sign up for
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   if they don't know who you are
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and they don't care about it.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   So I think separating
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   a lot of the confusions
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   people have,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   they're doing the stuff
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   you observe for role one
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   as working,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   and they're trying to
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   use that to succeed
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   in role two.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   But in role two,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   almost no one succeeds,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   and if you want to succeed there,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   you've got to make a huge swing.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Like, if you want to try to
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   build a social presence
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   from scratch,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   you really have to think about it
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   like you're a showrunner
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   for a cable network.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Like, "I've got to try
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   to make a show
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   that's going to break through
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   and get a big audience."
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   It can't just be random.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   It can't just be,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   "Let's just film some stuff
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   and put it on AMC
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   and hope people watch."
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   You have to, like,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   really think through,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   like, "There's a niche
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   in the market.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   I've got to really invest in this.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   I think this is different
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   than what anyone else is doing.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   It's very catchy.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   It plays on the medium well."
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Like, you really would have
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   to be thinking about this
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   like a major endeavor.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Newsletters are even harder.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   People don't sign up
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   for newsletters
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   if they don't have
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   a reason to do so.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   So don't mess up,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   don't mix up
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   role one strategies
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   for this technology
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   to try to achieve
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   a role two goal.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And so I think
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   making these separations,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   hopefully that helps clarify
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   how people think about this.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   I don't know.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   I think it helps me.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Because, I don't know, Jesse,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   you tell me if you think
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   that's more clarifying.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   But that's basically the way,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   that's how I finally realized
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   what people were doing.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   And so, like, well,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   I'm doing the same things
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Ryan Holiday is doing.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I'm looking at, like,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   the clips he's putting
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   on his Instagram,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   and I'm doing that myself,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   and why don't I have
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   the followers?
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   And it's like, well,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   he already has the audience,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   and so he's just feeding them
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   things they can spread.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   So if you do that same thing
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   when you don't yet
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   have the audience,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   it's not going to happen.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   So there's got to be
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   some core,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   you have to get the audience
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   or win the audience
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   at some point.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And if you don't have something,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   to win an audience
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   from scratch on social media
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   is really hard.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   It's like having your show
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   be top five in the ratings.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   It's just really hard to do.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   All right.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   What do we got next?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Next question is from Tom.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   I'm a software engineer
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   wanting to take on
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   more technically advanced
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   work projects involving
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   LLMs and 3D computer graphics.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   My last formal math class
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   was in high school,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   so I lack the foundational skills
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   to be good.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   To be so good,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   I can't be ignored.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   I think I need to add
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   one to two hours of daily study.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   How can I do this
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   on top of a full plate of work,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   hobbies, exercise, and young kids?
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Well, you know,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   I'm going to start my answer
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   by saying make sure first
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   you're facing
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   the productivity dragon.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   How much time
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   do these various things
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   you care about take?
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   And if that time
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   adds up to more time
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   than you have reasonably available,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   you can't do all the things.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   The universe,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   and in particular
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   the physics of time,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   do not care about
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   your list of what you want to do.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   So the universe
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   is not going to accommodate
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   by bending the rules of time
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   the fact that in addition
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   to all these things,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   you want to do something else as well.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   So facing the productivity dragon
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   can be freeing sometimes, right?
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Because it might lead you to say,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   I like my full life
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   outside of work,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   and I have young kids,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and I'm into this exercise,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and I don't really have time
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   to pick up a major new skill.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   That time doesn't exist.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   And okay, great.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Then I don't feel guilty
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   about not doing that.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   And that might be the answer here.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   That you face the productivity dragon
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   and say we can't do
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   all of these things,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   so maybe I'll put my attention
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   towards getting better
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   at the things I'm already doing at work
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   during work itself.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Through my selection of projects,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   for example,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   taking on projects
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   that stretch my skills,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   and I can actually act
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   on those stretches during work.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   I'm learning new things
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   to try to use.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I'm learning this skill
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   for exactly the feature
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   I'm trying to add,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   the sprint I'm doing right now.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   You're integrating the learning
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   into your work.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   You're moving your project skills
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   towards areas that you think
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   are going to give you
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   more career capital that's useful.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Let me just be better
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   about what I'm doing
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   during the work day.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   That might be the answer.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Or the answer might be,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   no, no, no, I'm doing
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   and if I could do LLM work,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   it's going to open up
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   a lot of things.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Maybe there's a lot of jobs
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I could do remote
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   at 1.5x the salary,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   which really would open up
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   this whole vision I have
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   for what I want to do with life.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Or maybe if I could do LLM work,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   it could be six months on,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   six months off.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Maybe it unlocks
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   something really cool.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I've got to figure this out.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   In that case,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   again, you have to face reality
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   and look for some
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   more extreme options.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   For example,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   maybe what you need to do
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   is take vacation time
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   and be like,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   I'm going to take 10 days
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   and just hammer on this
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   with a course on this technology
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   six hours a day,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   crash course this,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   maybe spend two days
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   with someone who knows
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   all about this,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   pay someone to come to me
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   on the weekend
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   and be like,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   teach me how to build this LLM
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   using whatever particular,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   I'm using TensorFlow
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   or something like this.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   I want you to really
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   walk me through it
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   and explain that to me,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   explain that to me,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   explain that to me.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I'm going to just
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   crash course it.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   It might mean you're saying,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   okay, here's what I want to do.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   I normally work
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   from nine to five,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   but what I'm going to do
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   is I'm going to start work
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   at eight so I can get
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   an hour in every morning
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   on an online course
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   and then stretch that out
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   over six months
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   to pick up the skills.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Maybe what this is going
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   to require is like,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   I'm going to have to ask
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   a big sacrifice for my wife
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   and say, look,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I'm not going to be able
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   to do my school drop-offs
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   for four months,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   but here's why.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   If I could pick up this skill,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   I think it's going to get us
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   closer to X, Y, and Z
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   or we'll swap back
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   and I'll take them all
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   after this is over,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   but you might have
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   to change something,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   try to do something
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   more extreme
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   or you find a way
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   to get formal permission.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Okay, I'm doing the math.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   It doesn't add up.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   My evening doesn't
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   have this time.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Let me get formal position
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   from my boss.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I spend one to two every day
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   working on an online course
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   on LLMs because I think
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   I should have that skill
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   because we might want to,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   you know,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   I need to be conversant
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   in that if we want
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   to add those features
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   and they're like,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   okay, yeah,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   if you can work around
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   and not fall behind
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   on your whatever.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   So you might have,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   you could do something,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   you have to engineer
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   something more extreme.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   That's not just,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   I'll just add this
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   to what I do after work,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   but face the dragon.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Don't try to change
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   the laws of physics and time
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   and either settle on,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   well, let me build my capital
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   and what I'm doing
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   or find something
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   you can change.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   That's going to make
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   that more possible.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   My only other word
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   of advice is going to be
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   if you're going to learn
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   something new,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   make sure every minute
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   you're spending
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   is actually challenging you
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   and helping you learn
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   something new.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Like I want to actually
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   build a LLM using
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   open source model
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   and these libraries.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   I have that goal
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   and everything I'm doing
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   is like towards that goal.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   So I'm not just getting
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   lost reading
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   and watching YouTube videos
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   and like generally exploring
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and having ideas
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   and people are drawing
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   cute diagrams of transformers.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   You don't really know
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   what's going on.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Like no,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   if you need to learn
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   linear algebra
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   to understand
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   what they're talking about
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   when they're doing,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   what's the dot product?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   I don't remember
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   how to do
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   metrics embeddings
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   or whatever.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Go learn that
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   with like a course
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   you're learning it
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   and then be like,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   I want to then use that
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   to build something here
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   and show that I built it.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   So be very concrete.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   You don't want to waste the time
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   because you don't have
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   that much time
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   to actually spare.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   All right,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   who do we got next?
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Next question is from Ryan.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   I'm in the Bay Area.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   I'm a Bay Area tech guy
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   in my fifties
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   who has spent the last 25 years
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   pursuing one lifestyle plan
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   focused on the hustle
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   of building high growth products
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   while raising high growth kids.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   I'd like to spend
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   the next 25 years
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   pursuing a very different
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   lifestyle plan
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   anchored in the emerging set
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   of second mountain core values.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   I even took a year off
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   as a sabbatical
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   to figure this out
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   but found myself
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   coming right back
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   to my first mountain
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   at the end.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   - Do you think
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   when he says high growth kids,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   he's trying to have his kids be tall?
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   There's lots of milk.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Gets you tall.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   I was just watching.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   I re-watched
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   because I have to watch things
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   while I do my PT.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   I was re-watching Last Dance,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   the ESPN documentary
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   about the 98 bulls.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   - But it saved a lot of people
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   during COVID.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   - Yeah,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   that was early in COVID.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Yeah,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   so I'm re-watching that whole thing.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   But anyways,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   my point is if you're tall,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   you can do well.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   - Yeah,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   you can do well.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Some of those guys,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   it's crazy.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Like Scotty Pippen
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   is playing,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   oh God,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   was this at the high school level maybe?
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Maybe at the college level.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   He was like 6'2".
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   - Yeah,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   he grew a ton.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   - Yeah,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   and they're like,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   you're like a fine basketball player
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   but if you're 6'2",
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   unless you're Allen Iverson,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   right?
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   It's fine.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And then he came back
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   and he was like 6'6".
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And then he kept growing
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   but that was over a summer.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   - And it's like,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   oh,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   if you're a fine basketball player in 6'2",
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   a fine basketball player in 6'6"
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   is like a whole different situation.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   You're like,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   oh,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   now this is useful.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Yeah,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   same with Jordan.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   He grew.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   - Yeah.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   - He was short
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   and he didn't make the team
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   as a freshman in high school
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   and then he grew.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   He also got better
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   but like he grew.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   It makes a big difference.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Ryan,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   I don't think that's what you're doing
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   though with high growth kids
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   but it's interesting to think about.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   So,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   this is a common,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   it's a common issue,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   right?
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   So,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   if you don't know
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   the first mountain,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   second mountain,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   that comes from David Brooks' book
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   The Second Mountain
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   where part of your adult life
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   is focused on what he calls
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   first mountain goals
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   which are professional aspirations.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   It's success.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   It's distinction standing out
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   and he says
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   there's going to be a point,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   at some point,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   you're going to move beyond
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   that first mountain
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   and Brooks talks about
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   you fall into a valley
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   between the first and second mountain
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   where you're going to have some despair
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   and then you realize,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   oh,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   what really matters
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   are these second mountain values
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   which as he talks about
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   are the types of things
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   people will talk about
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   in your eulogy.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   In your eulogy,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   no one is going to say,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   hey,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   you know,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   we delivered quarter over quarter growth,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   you know,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   for fiscal year 2020
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   to the fiscal year,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   you know,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   2030 or whatever.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Like,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   that's not going to be
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   what they talk about
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   in your eulogy.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   It's going to be
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   this was a dependable person.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   He was there for you.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   He was like a leader
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   in our community
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   and Brooks says
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   as you get older,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   the second mountain values
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   become more important
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   and that you need to sort of
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   shift more towards them.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   You've done,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   and Brooks is writing largely
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   for high achieving upper middle class
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   knowledge workers
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   which is like what Brooks is
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   talking about
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   when he went through
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   and Ryan,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   it sounds like you as well.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   So that's what he's talking about
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   these second mountain values.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   It's hard to make that shift,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   right,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   in part because
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   the first round values
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   give you something
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   concrete to do
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   and you can succeed at it
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   and they give you resources
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   and they can dominate
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   your whole life.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Often the people
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   that Brooks talks about
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   who make this transition
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   have some sort of
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   inciting event.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Like for Brooks,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   it was his divorce.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   So like often there's like
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   some inciting event.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Ryan,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   you might not have
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   like had an exterior event yet.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   You're just noticing
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   this is a shift
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   that you're leaning towards.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   So it's going to be
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   a more gradual transition.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   A couple of things
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   I would recommend.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Do lifestyle centric planning.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Brooks leaves this out
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   but I'm going to put it in.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Do lifestyle centric planning
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   with second mountain values
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   that resonate with you in mind.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   So what do I want my life
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   to actually be like
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   five years from now
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   day to day?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Like where am I?
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Where am I going?
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   What type of place do I live?
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Am I at an office or not?
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Like what's going on
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   with my older kids at this point?
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   How is my time spent?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Am I, you know,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   walking through the woods
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   or am I, you know,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   in a golf club?
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Like I don't know.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   You're feeling it.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   What is my life
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   actually feel like?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And make sure
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   the second mountain values
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   that resonate
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   are in this image.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   And then do the straight up
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   lifestyle centric planning work
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   of let me work backwards
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   from that.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   How do I steer?
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Like what are the obstacles
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   and opportunities
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   and how do I steer towards that?
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   So like you have to be
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   probably more systematic
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   about this
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   than you started this.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Like I'm looking at your question.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   You started this.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Like you wrote out roles
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   and you're trying to think
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   like what you want to do
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   in your life.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   You're adding roles
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   probably like leader
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   and community member
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   that you wanted to make
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   more important.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   But the question is
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   how you do that.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   And that's where lifestyle
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   centric planning comes in.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Because you're not just saying
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   I want to be more of a leader.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   You have like a specific part
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   of your image.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   You know,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   I'm involved
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   in like the board
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   at my community
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   and like really there
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   and I'm at a meeting
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   and we're trying to figure
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   something out
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   and people turn to me
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   and I'm like
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   thickly enmeshed
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   with, you know,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   some organization.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   You have a more concrete image
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   of what that means.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   And now you're working backwards
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   from something more concrete.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   The whole lifestyle centric
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   planning methodology
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   is all about obstacles
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   and opportunities.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Leveraging the opportunities
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   you have
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   to help you get closer
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   and really identifying
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   the obstacles
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   and saying
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   how do I get rid of those
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   or circumvent them.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   This is probably
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   where your current work
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   which is being driven
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   by these first mountain values.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   This is where your current work
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   will probably come up
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   as an obstacle.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And in this exercise
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   is where you're going to
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   start thinking about
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   well how do I reconfigure
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   this work
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   in a way that
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   allows me to
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   get to these other parts
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   of my lifestyle vision.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   So ultimately
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   it's going to be changing
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   some details of your work
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   in the second half
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   of your working life.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   But you got to work backwards
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   from that lifestyle centric planning.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   You can't just abstractly say
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   this role or value
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   is important to me.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Let me just try to do more
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   of that in my life.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   It's much more difficult than that.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   You also have to assume
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   it's going to take a while.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   The path between
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   the mountains is long.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   And you might go
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   into a deep valley
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   where you have
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   an inciting event
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   like a divorce
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   or a health scare
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   or maybe it's
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   just not as nice
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   through a meadow.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   It's not dark
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   but it's still going to be
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   meandering and long.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   So you have a vision.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   You work towards it.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   You edit.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   You work towards it.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   You edit.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   You work towards it.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   But you're beginning
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   to turn your eyes
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   towards that second mountain.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   And there will be changes.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   The only other thing
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   I would recommend is
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   if you've read Brooks's book
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   also read Richard Rohr's book
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Falling Upward.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   It's more explicitly religious
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   but it's the book
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   that David Brooks
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.760]   based the second mountain on.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.760]   So if you want to get
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.760]   to the core ideas
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.760]   but sort of stripped
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.760]   of a Brooksian
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.760]   upper middle class
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.760]   worker veneer
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   like let me just get
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   to the core ideas
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.760]   without that piece.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.760]   That's helpful
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   for a lot of people
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.760]   to see it in a more
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.760]   purified form.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.760]   So check out
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.760]   Richard Rohr's book
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.760]   R-O-H-R
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.760]   Falling Upward.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.760]   All right.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.760]   What do we got next?
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.760]   Next question
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   is from Rebecca.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   I often find myself
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   unable to make
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   meaningful progress
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   with organizing
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   my thoughts and projects
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.760]   given the volume
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.760]   of the past materials
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:47.760]   I have.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.760]   What strategies
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:49.760]   could help me move
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.760]   past this paralysis
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.760]   and build momentum
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760]   towards fully getting
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.760]   things moving
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.760]   smoothly?
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   Well,
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.760]   you know,
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.760]   I'm not a big believer
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.760]   in complicated
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.760]   information systems.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.760]   I'm not a big believer
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.760]   in what is holding you
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.760]   back from a project
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.760]   is like you can't
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.760]   quite get the right
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.760]   information together
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.760]   to make progress.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.760]   I think in general
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.760]   people should work
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   on fewer big projects.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.760]   They should wait
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.760]   until they have an idea
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.760]   that won't leave them alone
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.760]   and then act on it.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.760]   And then once
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.760]   they're acting on it
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.760]   put their perfectionism
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.760]   aside and say great
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.760]   I'm going to follow this
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   through to the end
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   to see what happens
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.760]   in the end.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.760]   So if you're exposing
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.760]   yourself to a lot
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.760]   of information,
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.760]   you're reading things,
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.760]   you have ideas,
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.760]   wait to see what
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.760]   like sticks with you.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.760]   Like, yeah,
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   I keep having this idea
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.760]   about something we could
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   do at our business.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.760]   It's come up a few times now.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   I mentioned this to someone.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   They thought it was a good idea.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.760]   Okay, great.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.760]   Let's go do that.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.760]   Or I've got this
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.760]   like personal project.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.760]   I don't know.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.760]   I keep seeing these
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   Instagram stories
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   about people with
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   their such and such
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.760]   like, I don't know,
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   workshop and it's
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760]   really appealing to me.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:49.760]   I keep coming back to that.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.760]   Okay, great.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:51.760]   Let's do that.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.760]   Let's see what sticks
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.760]   on that project.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.760]   So just wait till something
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:55.760]   sticks with you
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.760]   and then see it through
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   just because it's interesting
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   to see it through.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   Don't overemphasize
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.760]   the like I got to
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.760]   get all my information right.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   Don't overemphasize
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.760]   this idea of there's
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.760]   a right project to do
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.760]   and if you choose
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   the wrong one,
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   you're in trouble.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   Just see what sticks,
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   take action,
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   follow it through,
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.760]   interesting things
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.760]   will happen, repeat.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   Don't overcomplicate it.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.760]   Find value in the actual
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.760]   like execution of things
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:16.760]   because it's kind of fun.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   If this one doesn't
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.760]   work out,
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:19.760]   the next one will.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760]   All that together
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.760]   should stop
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.760]   some of this
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.760]   sense of paralysis.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   I'm like that
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   with books, Jesse.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.760]   I'm like,
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.760]   I read a lot of stuff.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.760]   I think a lot of stuff.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.760]   How do I come
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.760]   with a book idea?
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.760]   It's just something
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.760]   sticks with me
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.760]   for a long time
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:34.760]   and I just mull it.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   I come back to it.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:36.760]   I have other ideas.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.760]   I come back to it
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:38.760]   and mull other things.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   If something has stuck
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.760]   with me for a while,
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.760]   it's very informal.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.760]   I'm like, you know what?
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.760]   That could be a book
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.760]   and then I start seriously
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.760]   like talking to my circle
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   about it.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   I don't have complicated
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   information tracking systems.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   I don't have to emerge
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.760]   from some sort of
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   like content semantic graph
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   that's on some
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   complicated program.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   It's just like an idea
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.760]   that sticks with me
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:56.760]   and my gut says
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   this feels timely.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.760]   That's all it is.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.760]   All right.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   What do we got next?
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.760]   We have our corner.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.760]   Our slow productivity corner.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.760]   Let's hear that theme music.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.760]   This is the segment
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.760]   where we tackle a question
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.760]   relevant to my last book,
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   Slow Productivity,
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.760]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.760]   Without Productivity.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.760]   This is a segment
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   where we tackle
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.760]   a question relevant
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.760]   to my last book,
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   Slow Productivity,
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.760]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.760]   Without Productivity.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.760]   This is a segment
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.760]   where we tackle
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.760]   a question relevant
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.760]   to my last book,
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.760]   Slow Productivity,
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.760]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.760]   Without Productivity.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.760]   All right, Jesse,
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:25.760]   what is our
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.760]   Slow Productivity corner
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.760]   question of the week?
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.760]   Without burnout.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.760]   What did I say?
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.760]   Without productivity.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.760]   I said the lost
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.760]   art of accomplishment
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   without productivity.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   That could actually
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.760]   kind of be
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.760]   that could be your next book.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   That could work.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.760]   The first chapter
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:39.760]   is like how to steal.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.760]   Steal ideas from people
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.760]   smarter.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   I wasn't going
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.760]   to say anything,
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   but then I was
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   the fans were probably
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.760]   overloaded something
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.760]   and then we have
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.760]   to distract them.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.760]   We have to distract them.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.760]   All right.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.760]   Brandon Sanderson
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   wrote name of the win.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.760]   Go.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   Somebody emailed me
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:56.760]   about that the other day.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.760]   He's like,
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.760]   do you know that?
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.760]   I was like,
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.760]   oh, it's actually a joke.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.760]   That's how we distract you
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.760]   when we make other mistakes.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.760]   All right.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.760]   What is our actual
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.760]   Slow Productivity
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.760]   question of the day?
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.760]   All right.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.760]   It's from
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   Seeking Slow Success.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.760]   I work in admin
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.760]   at a large university.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:12.760]   I'm struggling
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:13.760]   with the roles,
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.760]   many hats,
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   communications,
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   advising,
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   advising,
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.760]   event planning,
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:19.760]   financial,
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.760]   all sorts of stuff.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   It's also in the context
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   of a thick bureaucratic process.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.760]   I have heard
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   that this type of juggling
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:26.760]   is just typical
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   for this role
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   and that we're understaffed.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:29.760]   What should I do?
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:30.760]   Well,
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.760]   this is where
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:32.760]   the book Slow Productivity
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.760]   in your circumstance
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.760]   might be more effective
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.760]   for understanding
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.760]   why you're unhappy
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.760]   than it will be
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:39.760]   for helping you become happier.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.760]   Let me explain
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.760]   what I mean by that.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.760]   A core idea
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.760]   in that book,
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.760]   which really tries
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.760]   to deconstruct
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.760]   how the way
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.760]   we currently work
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.760]   in knowledge work,
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.760]   why it doesn't work.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.760]   A core idea in that book
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.760]   is what we talked about
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.760]   in the deep dive,
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:53.760]   which is the notion
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.760]   of overhead tax, right?
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.760]   Everything that you're working on,
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.760]   every process
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.760]   that you're responsible for,
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.760]   every task or project
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.760]   that's undergoing,
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   generates its own overhead
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.760]   of emails and meetings
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   and just cognitive cycles.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.760]   I have to think about this.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.760]   The more of these you have,
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.760]   the more of that overhead you have,
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.760]   the more of your cognitive cycles
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.760]   are taken up,
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.760]   the more of your day
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.760]   then becomes
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.760]   like servicing projects.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.760]   Now, when this gets really bad
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.760]   is when these various projects
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:19.760]   exist in different
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.760]   cognitive contexts.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   So to switch
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   from one to the other,
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   you have to completely
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.760]   switch your mindset.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.760]   So when you're switching
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.760]   from finances and development
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.760]   to academic and staff
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.760]   over to facilities,
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:29.760]   each of these
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:30.760]   is a fully different context.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   And so when you have
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.760]   a lot of things going on
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.760]   in a lot of topics,
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.760]   you have all these different
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.760]   emails and meetings
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:36.760]   you have to do.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   You're constantly
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:38.760]   switching contexts.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.760]   That is exhausting.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.760]   We're not wired for it.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:41.760]   It makes us miserable.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.760]   So I can validate
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.760]   why you're not feeling good
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.760]   about this position.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   Now, some people
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.760]   react worse than others
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   to this overhead taxing
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   out of control
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.760]   and to all this
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   context shifting.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   The most successful
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   high up
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.760]   university admins
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.760]   that I know
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.760]   just are naturally
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.760]   they're okay with it.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   Like, this is what I do.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.760]   In fact,
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.760]   usually it's because
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.760]   they take pride.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.760]   And I switch from this
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   to here to here.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.760]   And I find the right
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   thing to push
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.760]   and the right button.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.760]   And how do I help
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.760]   this person here?
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.760]   How do I move
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.760]   this information here?
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.760]   It's like a game.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.760]   They see it like
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   an orchestra conductor
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.760]   and you're trying to keep
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   these different things moving.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.760]   And some people can
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.760]   get enough pleasure
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.760]   out of that challenge
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.760]   that they can counteract
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.760]   the cognitive fatigue
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.760]   of having to do
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:30.760]   all that context switching.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:31.760]   Other people just feel
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.760]   the fatigue
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   of the context switching.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.760]   They're like,
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.760]   this is terrible.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.760]   I'm in that ladder camp.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   You put me in a high up
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.760]   administrative position
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.760]   at a university.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   That university
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.760]   is going out of business.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.760]   This is terrible.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   I can't keep
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   switching between these things.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.760]   You know what?
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.760]   I would rather,
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.760]   I know this is urgent.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.760]   Like, we're not going
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.760]   to have water
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.760]   in the east side of campus.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:53.760]   I just think we're not
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.760]   going to have water
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.760]   on the east side of campus.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.760]   I can't think about
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   all this stuff anymore.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.760]   This is crazy.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   I got to go do deep work.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   Other people can see
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   it as a challenge.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   So if you're like me,
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.760]   self productivity will explain
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:04.760]   why you're having a challenge.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   I think some of these
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   high level admin positions,
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   that's the position.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.760]   That's what they're hiring for.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.760]   That you're someone
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.760]   who can oversee
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.760]   a complicated array
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.760]   of different things
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   and try to keep
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   all those plates spinning.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   If this doesn't work
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   well with you,
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.760]   it might be a time
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.760]   to think about
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.760]   how do I take that
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.760]   career capital
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   and take it somewhere
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:22.760]   that's going to work
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   better for me.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.760]   But the key here,
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.760]   if you're doing that,
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.760]   is to figure out
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.760]   what better means.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.760]   And that's why
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.760]   you need to understand
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.760]   this overhead tax issue,
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   too many concurrent projects,
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.760]   that that is a problem.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   That's why you're unhappy.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.760]   So you know if you're looking
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   to do something else
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.760]   that takes your career capitals
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.760]   like a horizontal move,
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.760]   you know what
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.760]   you're optimizing for.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:41.760]   Minimize the number
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.760]   of concurrent things happening
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:43.760]   so you don't have
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.760]   so much context shifting
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.760]   in overhead tax.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   We often don't realize
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.760]   that's what's making us
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   unhappy about jobs.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   And when people are
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.760]   in that situation,
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.760]   we don't know that's why
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.760]   we're so exhausted,
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.760]   that it's the overhead tax.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   And so we start looking
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.760]   for other reasons
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.760]   that seem more obvious
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.760]   or proximate.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   It's like, well,
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.760]   maybe the bosses are bad
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   or the system is stupid.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.760]   And so then you shift
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   and you make these ineffectual
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.760]   high overhead shifts
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:05.760]   to another job
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.760]   that has just as much
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.760]   overhead tax,
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.760]   but you convince yourself
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:09.760]   it was the people
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.760]   and the broken processes
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.760]   and that's why you're unhappy.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   And you go to the other place
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   and you're still unhappy
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.760]   because, no,
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.760]   the problem was you're doing
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:16.760]   15 things at once
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.760]   and your brain was melting.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.760]   So it's useful to know
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.760]   that's a real problem.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   And I think just pointing out
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   overhead tax is a problem.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.760]   Too many concurrent tasks
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   is a problem.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.760]   And I'm looking for jobs,
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.760]   I'm evaluating them
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.760]   on what they're going to do
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.760]   with that type
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.760]   of concurrent tasks.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.760]   Just recognizing
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.760]   that's a problem
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.760]   could improve a lot of jobs.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.760]   But when you don't recognize
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   something is a problem,
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.760]   you focus on the other stuff.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   It's going to be the perks
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   or the benefits
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.760]   or the,
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.760]   I call it faux autonomy.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   Like, yeah,
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   you have a lot of autonomy
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.760]   in terms of how
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.760]   you spend your time,
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:44.760]   but not in terms
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.760]   of your workload.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.760]   So you really don't have
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.760]   any autonomy
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:48.760]   in how you spend your time
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   because you're trying
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.760]   to service 15 projects
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:51.760]   so it's all overhead tax
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.760]   all day.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.760]   So, yeah,
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.760]   we don't clock your hours.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   You can work remote
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.760]   if you want.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.760]   But also, who cares?
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.760]   You have to be in your inbox
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   15 hours a day
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   or things aren't going
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.760]   to work out.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.760]   So I don't think
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.760]   for your position,
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.760]   little things will help.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.760]   For keeping your overhead lower
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.760]   and trying to differentiate
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.760]   active and non-active projects.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:08.760]   But a lot of this,
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.760]   at that level
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.760]   for this type of job,
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.760]   a lot of that advice
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.760]   isn't going to work
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.760]   because of the nature
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.760]   of that job.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.760]   So at least knowing
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.760]   what it is you don't like
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.760]   about the job
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.760]   is going to help you
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:19.760]   understand how to fix it,
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.760]   what it is actually
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.760]   that you want to fix.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.760]   You've got to figure out
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.760]   the problem
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.760]   before you can really fix it.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   So it's,
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.760]   I don't know,
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.760]   I believe that, Jesse.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   It's like sometimes
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.760]   knowing why you're unhappy
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.760]   unless you fix it.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:31.760]   Like, the biggest problem
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.760]   is knowing
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.760]   why you're unhappy
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.760]   unless you fix it.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:35.760]   And like the biggest problem
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.760]   is unhappy people
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.760]   who don't know
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.760]   why they're unhappy
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:39.760]   because then you start
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.760]   just doing random stuff.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:42.760]   And it leaves some problems.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:43.760]   But what we can be happy about
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.760]   is hearing the theme music
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.760]   one more time.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.760]   All right.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.760]   Do we have a call this week?
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   We do.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.760]   All right.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.760]   Let's hear it.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   Hi, Cal.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.760]   My name is Jorge
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   and I have a question
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.760]   that really has to deal with
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.760]   being a good spouse.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   Like I said,
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.760]   being a good spouse
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:58.760]   is a lot of work.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   It's a lot of work
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.760]   and a lot of work
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.760]   and a lot of work
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.760]   to be a good spouse.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   The context is that
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.760]   my spouse is an interesting part of her life
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.760]   where one,
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.760]   she enjoyed most of her corporate life
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.760]   for the last 15 years.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.760]   Two, we have a family
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.760]   with young kids
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   where time with them
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.760]   is very, very precious
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.760]   before they become teenagers
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.760]   and start ignoring us.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.760]   And three,
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   she recently got laid off of her job.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   She is in the field of DEI,
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.760]   which is diversity, equity, inclusion,
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:31.760]   and navigating it
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.760]   has been very difficult.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.760]   It's been a very hostile environment
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.760]   for that industry
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.760]   for the past 24 months or so.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.760]   It's not like she works in a coal mine
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.760]   and all the mines are shutting down,
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   but it can feel like that at times
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.760]   and she expresses that.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.760]   She's been doing a lot of writing
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.760]   and starting to explore the idea
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.760]   of switching out of corporate life
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.760]   and doing more with crafts,
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.760]   cooking, general artistic things,
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.760]   and maybe even writing about those things.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.760]   I support her.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:03.760]   Initially, I recommended her the book
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.760]   "Slow Productivity"
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   as she faced this hiccup in her career
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.760]   and ways to explore doing new work.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   And then as she started talking
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.760]   about doing more artistic work
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.760]   and kind of make a transition,
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.760]   I suggested, "So good they can't ignore you."
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:17.760]   My question is,
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.760]   is there any approach I should be taking
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.760]   to support my spouse
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.760]   as they work through this period
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.760]   of life-based career planning?
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.760]   We are a family,
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.760]   can't do these things in a vacuum,
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.760]   and I want to be more than
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.760]   someone who just recommends books to her.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.760]   I want to know how to best show up
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.760]   to be alongside her
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.760]   as she goes through life-based career planning,
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.760]   whether she knows it or not.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.760]   Thank you.
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:43.760]   - Well, first of all,
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.760]   I like this approach of just give people my books.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.760]   That's like a good catch-all strategy.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.760]   That's going to be my answer for every question now.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.760]   Well, how many of my books have you read
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   or given the person?
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.760]   That'll solve the problem.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.760]   Now, the actual real first thing is,
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:57.760]   first of all,
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.760]   it really stinks to get laid off.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.760]   That's just emotionally hard.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.760]   It's psychologically hard.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:03.760]   It's financially hard.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.760]   There's a lot of empathy here, right?
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.760]   None of that's easy,
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.760]   especially if you feel like your whole industry
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.760]   in which you have expertise,
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.760]   the whole industry is struggling.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.760]   So it's not just my company had issues,
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.760]   but there's a bunch of other companies do this.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.760]   So we'll start with that.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.760]   It's just hard.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.760]   So I'm glad you're recognizing that.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.760]   That's hard.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.760]   It's hard to get laid off,
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:24.760]   especially at that phase of life.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:25.760]   So we'll start with that
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.760]   and not be too cheery optimistic.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.760]   Everything's going to be fine immediately.
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.760]   The next thing I would say,
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.760]   and you picked this up in your call,
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.760]   so I'm going to underscore it.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   The next thing I would say is that
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.760]   when you have a family with kids,
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.760]   lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:43.760]   the lifestyle you're planning
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.760]   is the full family's lifestyle.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.760]   It's no longer what is my ideal lifestyle,
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:50.760]   what is your ideal lifestyle,
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.760]   and we're both going to try to do
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.760]   our own planning towards those ideal lifestyles.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.760]   Because what's going to happen is
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.760]   when you're looking for obstacles and opportunities,
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.760]   the other person's opportunities
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.760]   might become an obstacle to you and vice versa.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:03.760]   And then you get resentment
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:04.760]   or at least you get confusion.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.760]   So I like what you said that we're a family.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.760]   That is critical here.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:09.760]   This is a good time.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.760]   This disruption is a good time to say,
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.760]   what is our lifestyle-centric plan?
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   And when you have young kids,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   you really should have three plans.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.760]   That's the way my wife and I did it.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.760]   What is our ideal lifestyle for the pre,
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.760]   we thought it was like the pre-elementary school period,
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.760]   the sort of the preschool and nanny period, right?
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:27.760]   And that was the period we were in
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   when we were doing this initial planning.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   So, you know, given what we have now.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.760]   Then we look ahead to like the elementary school period.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:36.760]   You start to have young kids
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.760]   that are first, second, third grade or this or that.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:40.760]   And then there's this third phase,
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:44.760]   this sort of in high school going off to college phase.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.760]   And then there's a phase after that,
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.760]   but that seems so distant.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.760]   You're like, we'll get to that later.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.760]   And you say, what do we want our lifestyle to be like
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.760]   during those periods?
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.760]   Like, what is it?
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.760]   What's the vision we have?
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:55.760]   And people have all sorts of different visions of this.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   Some people envision my kids having like a real city,
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   like urban upbringing and they're on the subways
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.760]   and we go, you know,
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.760]   take the subway to see the baseball game
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.760]   and going to blah, blah, blah.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.760]   Other people see, man, I really want,
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   when I'm thinking about my kid being in third grade,
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.760]   like I'm there, we pick him up from the bus stop.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.760]   Like they're coming home from the bus stop
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.760]   and like, I'm there and give them snacks.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.760]   And there's like people coming over.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.760]   Like, I don't know, you get these visions.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.760]   Like, what do I want it to be like?
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:25.760]   Then you work backwards from those.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.760]   So you should have a vision for pre-elementary school,
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.760]   during elementary school,
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.760]   and then sort of like late junior high, high school,
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.760]   like what you want those to be like.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.760]   That's what you're planning backwards from as a family.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:39.760]   So it's not about individuals so much anymore.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:42.760]   It's like, what's going to work with stress,
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:47.760]   finances, and the sort of flexibility or time required?
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.760]   Those are all really important.
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.760]   And then there's the bigger things like location.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.760]   All of those factors matter for family-centric,
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.760]   lifestyle-centric plans.
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.760]   Like where do we want our stress?
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.760]   What's our time or flexibility constraints?
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.760]   Is it like we're walking the kids to school
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.760]   and picking them up?
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.760]   Or is it, you know, there's a nanny,
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.760]   but we're home in the evenings?
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.760]   Is it like, how is that?
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:08.760]   Are you figuring that out?
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.760]   The finances, we don't want to be stressed by money.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.760]   So where do we want to be financially?
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.760]   We don't need to be farther than it,
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.760]   but like where's the place that's going to make us
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.760]   with the things we want to do with our family?
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.760]   Like where do we want to be financially?
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.760]   And like, what do we want the environment to be like?
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.760]   So location, like where we live.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.760]   Schooling comes up too.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.760]   Like what type of school do we want them to be going to?
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.760]   All of these factors go in.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.760]   And then you're making a plan as a family,
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.760]   and then you figure out the right configuration
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.760]   to get that done.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.760]   And this might require doing all sorts of like interesting
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.760]   hacking or arrangements with careers and jobs.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.760]   Like, well, you got this skill.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.760]   I have this.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.760]   My skill is actually very flexible.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.760]   Yours is less, but very high paying.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.760]   So I could do mine kind of lesser hours.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.760]   It's very flexible.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.760]   I'm a writer or something like that.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.760]   And that could then cover-- then I could be around
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:55.760]   to pick up the kids.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.760]   But your job is-- you have to be in the office,
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.760]   but it makes a lot of money.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.760]   And if you did that, but we went this path instead
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.760]   of that path, it's not going to be too bad.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.760]   You begin to figure out these different kind
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760]   of configurations.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.760]   You have two people, two skill sets,
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.760]   two sets of career possibilities available,
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:10.760]   and you can start mixing and matching
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.760]   to figure out your vision for the whole family lifestyle.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.760]   So that's what I would say is this is a time to start
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.760]   doing that planning together.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.760]   And there are so many different paths that might come out.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.760]   Like, OK, I'm going to take-- maybe your spouse takes
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.760]   a year off and then goes into this type of career over here,
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.760]   and you switch to this career.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.760]   You move over here where it's much cheaper.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.760]   And I don't know.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.760]   I've seen everything.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   But you don't get to the cool, unique configurations
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.760]   unless you're doing the lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.760]   So that's what I would say, family unit
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.760]   lifestyle-centric planning, three phases.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.760]   It's actually pretty fun to do because you have
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.760]   a lot of possibilities.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   You're two very skilled people.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.760]   You probably have a little financial flexibility.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.760]   You have young kids, which is fun.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.760]   You could figure out something pretty cool.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.760]   I love going through this planning process.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.760]   And we've been executing our plan pretty well.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.760]   And it's unique, I would say.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.760]   It's idiosyncratic.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   People don't really understand what I do for a living,
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.760]   and that's on purpose because there's all sorts of factors
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.760]   I get out of that in terms of flexibility and seasonality,
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.760]   et cetera.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.760]   So it's fun.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.760]   But do the planning as a family.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.760]   And there might be sacrifices involved.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.760]   This is not about making sure both of you
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.760]   have some sort of individual self-actualization
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.760]   to the highest extent.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.760]   You kind of got off that train when you had a family.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.760]   Family happy, that should be the goal.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.760]   All right.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.760]   We've got here a case study.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.760]   These are where people write in to jesse@calnewport.com,
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.760]   and they share their experience putting the type of advice
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.760]   we talked about on the show into practice
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.760]   in their everyday life.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.760]   This is a cool one from Erica.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.760]   It's about commuting, which we mentioned in last week's show.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.760]   We were talking about commuting when we were talking
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.760]   about remote work, so I thought this was an appropriate
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.760]   follow-up case study to last week's deep dive.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.760]   All right.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.760]   Erica says, "On episode 337," that was last week,
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.760]   "Cal mentioned the benefits of having a commute prior to
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.760]   and after work.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.760]   I have developed a great appreciation for my daily
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.760]   commute routine to and from the office.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.760]   I've also done a little bit of lifestyle-centric planning
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.760]   with my commute.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.760]   I started working for a new company in 2024,
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.760]   which reduced my daily commute from over an hour each way
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.760]   to about 20 minutes each way.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.760]   Secondly, I love driving as a hobby,
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.760]   so I found a job where I can drive into the office
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   and have free parking.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.760]   On the way to work, I drink my smoothie
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.760]   and listen to a podcast,
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.760]   Monday is always deep questions.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.760]   Because I'm driving, I'm not using my phone
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.760]   and looking at social media,
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.760]   and so I'm able to get my mind cleared
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:37.760]   out of various nonsense and be ready for work.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.760]   On the way home, I generally listen to music
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.760]   and either go to the gym or go window shopping,
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.760]   like trying out perfumes at various department
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.760]   and beauty stores.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.760]   The commute going home allows me to let work melt away
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.760]   until the next morning.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.760]   Note, I also used a time block planner
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.760]   and a Kanban board to help me feel set for the next day,
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.760]   but the commute is a great shutdown routine.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.760]   When I work at home, I have in the past
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.760]   eschewed simulating a commute,
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.760]   so I feel cranky most of the day.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760]   So I'm trying to use my treadmill
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760]   and my bicycle indoor trainer
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.760]   to do a little bit of exercise in the mornings.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.760]   It helps some, but it's not the same as my morning drive.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   So I found that I work from home as little as possible
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.760]   and will even go into the office
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.760]   even if it's half a day of work.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.760]   While changing locations and adjusting my commute
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.760]   is not the typical big idea
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.760]   lifestyle-centric planning changes some want,
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.760]   this small change has been a very large positive outcome.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.760]   I feel that this one small change
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.760]   has helped my general mood and focus in a large way.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.760]   Well, I like this idea that you do not need
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.760]   big ideas for lifestyle-centric career planning
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.760]   to have a big impact.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.760]   In fact, I often make a contrast
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.760]   between lifestyle-centric planning and the alternative,
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   which is the grand goal approach.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760]   The grand goal approach is like
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760]   I have some big thing I go after
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.760]   and it makes my life magical from there on out.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.760]   It almost never works.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   Lifestyle-centric career planning
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   could lead to some things that in retrospect
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.760]   kind of look radical or interesting,
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   but they don't have to.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.760]   And a lot of the biggest impacts
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.760]   come from these smaller changes.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.760]   So like in Erica's case,
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.760]   shifting to a job with a 20-minute commute,
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.760]   that was a key shift
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.760]   for the things she valued in her lifestyle-centric plan
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.760]   because the commute was actually helpful for her,
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.760]   but an hour-long commute is brutal.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.760]   And so now it was like I can do this commute.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.760]   It's long enough to be effective as a phase transition,
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.760]   but not so long that it's brutal.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.760]   20 minutes is not bad at all.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.760]   Trust me, in Washington, D.C.,
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.760]   20 minutes is roughly what it takes
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.760]   to get out of your neighborhood
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.760]   before you can even get to a major road.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:33.760]   So 20 minutes is not bad at all,
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.760]   just long enough to change your mindset,
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.760]   but not so long that it's a problem.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.760]   So now she could say let me just go to work then.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.760]   I'll go to my office.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.760]   I'll park.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:41.760]   I have a transition.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.760]   Work real hard.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.760]   Shut down.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:44.760]   Complete my time block planner.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.760]   I've got things stored on my boards.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.760]   I can let my mind go
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.760]   and enjoy that commute back,
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.760]   and I'm in a better mood.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   That's a great configuration.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.760]   We forget this in a lot of the discussions
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   about remote work that early on,
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   a lot of the people who were arguing for remote work,
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.760]   it was in part because their commutes were really bad.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.760]   It's a really long commute,
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:02.760]   and it's kind of grinding on me,
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.760]   so it'd be nice not to have to do that all the time.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.760]   But there was a whole middle group of people
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.760]   where the commute's not so bad.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.760]   They're not worried about ...
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.760]   They have a plan for the childcare.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.760]   That's the other thing.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:16.760]   They have a plan for my work ends two hours after school.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.760]   That's figured out.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.760]   And they actually like it.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.760]   So you do the drive.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:21.760]   You're there.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.760]   When you're home, you're home,
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.760]   and you have some separation.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.760]   So that's a great example
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.760]   of sort of small-scale changes from an LCP
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.760]   leading to big positive improvements.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.760]   All right.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760]   We got our final segment coming up,
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.760]   where we'll talk about the books I read in January.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.760]   But first, let's hear from another sponsor.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.760]   So I think one of the harder things about raising a family,
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.760]   we were just talking about families on the call before,
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.760]   is food.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.760]   It is difficult.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.760]   You're trying to find food for your family
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   that is healthy,
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.760]   that doesn't have junk in it,
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.760]   that's not like a bowl of Red Dye No. 5
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.760]   or whatever the thing is they just banned,
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.760]   and floating in the middle is a marshmallow,
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.760]   but also that your family will eat.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.760]   I mean, this is so much of what
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.760]   my life and my wife's life has been about,
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.760]   is like as each kid goes through this certain age band,
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.760]   it's like, "We've got to find food they'll eat.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.760]   It's got to be healthy."
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.760]   And then they'll decide that essentially all food is bad.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.760]   And so food is something you think about all the time
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.760]   if you have a family.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.760]   This is why I like Thrive Market.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.760]   Thrive Market makes it simple to find trusted,
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.760]   family-friendly brands without spending hours
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.760]   in the grocery store.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.760]   From snacks and school lunches to pantry staples,
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:33.760]   everything they offer is 100% non-GMO,
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   and with their on-site filters,
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.760]   you can shop based on what matters most to your family.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.760]   So maybe it's low sugar, or it's gluten-free,
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.760]   or it's organic, or it's high-protein options.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.760]   All of this is just a click away.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.760]   For example, the low-sugar filter is a great one
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.760]   on Thrive Market, because my kids,
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.760]   some days of the week, I mean,
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.760]   essentially their energy level is what you would get
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:02.760]   if you gave a lot of PCP to a hyperactive super criminal.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.760]   They don't need more sugar.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:05.760]   So you get these low-sugar options.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.760]   Let me just look at the low-sugar options,
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.760]   because one of the things we buy a lot of is snacks,
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.760]   snacks for school and for when they come home.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.760]   Great, I could just filter for those
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.760]   and select what it is I want.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.760]   One feature that's really cool
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.760]   is the Healthy Swap Scanner in the Thrive Market app.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.760]   Here's how it works.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.760]   You scan a product that you're used to buying,
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.760]   like, oh, here's a thing I usually buy,
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.760]   and it will instantly recommend a cleaner,
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.760]   healthier alternative.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:33.760]   This is also a game-changer, especially, again,
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.760]   the snack thing is where this is really a cool game-changer.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:39.760]   All right, pretzels, sticks, or whatever.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.760]   We kind of get these, snap it.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.760]   Oh, here is, like, a salty snack that's no GMOs,
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.760]   no, like, less artificial stuff in it.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.760]   So, again, it just makes it easy to get family food
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.760]   for your family that you can trust.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.760]   Cool app, easy to use.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.760]   It's delivered.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:58.760]   That's great as well.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.760]   You're not going to the supermarket and standing there.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.760]   So I've become a big fan of Thrive Market.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.760]   Thrive Market's Smart Cart feature
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.760]   takes the guesswork out of healthy shopping.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.760]   When you create an account,
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.760]   they ask you about your family's needs
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.760]   and automatically build a cart full of cleaner versions
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.760]   of your favorite brands.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:14.760]   I love this.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:15.760]   So tired of going to the store.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.760]   You can tweak it before checking out,
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.760]   but it's a great way to get started,
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.760]   especially if you're trying to phase out junk food.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.760]   So if you're ready for a junk-free start to 2025,
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.760]   head to thrivemarket.com/deep
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.760]   and get 30% off your first order,
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.760]   plus a free $60 gift.
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:33.760]   It's a good promo, actually.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.760]   That's T-H-R-I-V-E, market.com/deep,
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.760]   thrivemarket.com/deep.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.760]   Also want to talk about our friends at Shopify.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.760]   Look, I'm in the, what do you call it?
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.760]   Online world, a podcast, I have a newsletter.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.760]   So I know a lot of people in the online world
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:58.760]   and the people I know who sell stuff online,
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.760]   they use Shopify.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.760]   It is just the industry standard.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.760]   It's a fantastic backend experience for you,
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.760]   the person selling.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.760]   It's a fantastic shopping cart experience
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.760]   for the person buying.
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.760]   Their shopping carts have an incredible conversion rate.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.760]   So you're not going to lose people at that final step.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   They go beyond online selling as well.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.760]   They have point of sale technology.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   So now you have your store that's actually in real life.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.760]   You Shopify can integrate and help you right there.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.760]   I mean, it is a no brainer.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.760]   If you're going to sell things,
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.760]   you need to be using Shopify.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.760]   So you can upgrade your business
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.760]   and get the same checkout that so many people I know use
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.760]   when you use Shopify.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.760]   Sign up for a $1 per month trial period
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.760]   at shopify.com/deep.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.760]   Now you need to type that in all lowercase,
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.760]   but you go to shopify.com/deep
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.760]   to upgrade your selling today.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.760]   That's shopify.com/deep.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.760]   All right, let's move on to our final segment.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.760]   Every month at the beginning of each month,
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.760]   I talk about the books I read the month before.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   As long time listeners know,
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.760]   my goal is to read five books a month.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.760]   So this is our first episode of January or February rather.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.760]   So I will talk about the books I read in January 2025.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.760]   All right, I started with film appreciation book.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.760]   I don't know if it was called "The Film Appreciation Book"
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.760]   or "Film Appreciation Book" by Jim Piper.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:31.760]   I'm an amateur cinephile,
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.760]   so I like to randomly read sort of pseudo textbooks
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.760]   or books about movies.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.760]   And this was like a, almost like a textbook, right?
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.760]   It just went through like a lot of different aspects of film
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.760]   and talked about how they mattered.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.760]   I like this one because it had a lot of pictures and scenes.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.760]   You could go on the YouTube and watch the scenes.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.760]   They had pictures in the book.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.760]   So when they're talking about different types of shots
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.760]   or different types of compositions,
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.760]   I really like being able to actually just see it.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.760]   So it was fine.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.760]   It's one of these like systematic books.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.760]   You're just going to learn a lot of terminology
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.760]   and learn a lot, learn about like a lot of like stuff
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.760]   you should know if you want to know the lingo for film.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.760]   So it was a good one.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.760]   - A lot of your fans are interested in,
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.760]   because it's movie season,
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.760]   is your take on the films of this year?
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.760]   - We should do more film stuff.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.760]   Last year, my wife and I watched all 10 Best Picture nominees.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.760]   I don't know if we're going to do that this year.
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.760]   I've seen a bunch of them.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.760]   - There's been requests.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.760]   - I'm not super excited by,
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.760]   I'm trying to think what in the Best Picture nominations
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.760]   this year that I've been super excited about.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.760]   - Mad Dog saw Dylan like four times.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.760]   - Yeah, that was good.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:37.760]   I saw it in the theater.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.760]   Yeah, Complete Unknown was,
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:39.760]   I thought that was very good.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.760]   That move, that for over two hour long movie,
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.760]   that thing rock and rolled in more ways than one.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.760]   So that thing really moved.
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.760]   Chalamet was great.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.760]   I liked the direction was very good.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.760]   That director also did the Walk the Line,
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.760]   Johnny Cash, which was also very good.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.760]   That's a favorite.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.760]   Dune II I saw last fall, last spring,
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.760]   doing my book tour.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.760]   So I was in Austin doing Ryan Holiday's podcast
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:10.760]   and Chris Williamson's podcast.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.760]   I think those are the two I was doing.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.760]   So I was in Austin and then one of them got canceled.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.760]   I had an afternoon free
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.760]   and walked over to a cool indie theater in Austin
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.760]   and saw Dune II like right when it came out.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.760]   That was cool.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:25.760]   I enjoyed that.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.760]   That was fun.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.760]   So like that was pretty good.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:28.760]   I saw Conclave recently.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.760]   It was okay.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.760]   - I saw that.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.760]   - Yeah, I thought it was,
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.760]   I mean, I liked the high contrast cinematography.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.760]   I thought it was like kind of beautifully shot.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.760]   It was cool.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.760]   It's based off a Richard Harris book.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.760]   What else is out though?
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.760]   I've been hearing bad things about Amelia Perez.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.760]   Like people just don't like it.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:43.760]   - There's the one--
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.760]   - I watched it on Netflix though.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.760]   So it's easy to see.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.760]   I watched Substance with Demi Moore.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.760]   My wife was like, I'm done with this.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.760]   It's a body horror movie.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.760]   She hates that type of stuff.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   You know, where it's like, that was good.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.760]   I was liking that.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.760]   - Who's supposed to win best actor
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.760]   other than if it's not Chalamet?
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.760]   - I don't know.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.760]   I just read an article that said
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.760]   it's like everyone could win.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.760]   - Yeah, it was the one guy, Brody and the other one.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:06.760]   - Yeah, so Brutalist is still hard to,
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:07.760]   it's here in DC.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:08.760]   So I should see it.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:09.760]   It's three hours.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.760]   - Yeah, there's an intermission.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:12.760]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.760]   - I haven't seen it.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.760]   - I gotta get my back in better shape, I think,
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760]   before I see The Brutalist.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:17.760]   Or I have to wait till it comes.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.760]   I'd love to see the,
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.760]   so last year I saw almost everything in the theater.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.760]   And I loved it.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.760]   I couldn't get everything.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.760]   I saw almost everything.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.760]   Brutalist I do want to see.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.760]   And it is playing in a couple places here in DC.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:29.760]   So I should see it.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:30.760]   I like Brody.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.760]   I don't know what else the other nominees were.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.760]   - I don't know either.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.760]   - Which is like a problem, right?
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.760]   That means it's not,
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.760]   it's not a super exciting year.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.760]   But this was the year with less movies
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760]   because of the strike.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.760]   The after effect of the strike two years ago
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.760]   was the things not going in the pipeline
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.760]   then meant last year was
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.760]   just not as many movies were out.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.760]   So I don't know.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   We'll see.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.760]   Maybe I'll end up seeing more of them.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.760]   All right, second book I read.
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.760]   I had originally read this years ago,
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.760]   but I went back and reread
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.760]   Rich Roll's memoir, Finding Ultra.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.760]   He'd actually updated it.
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.760]   So I guess this is the newer version of it.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.760]   It's just a cool story.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.760]   People forget back when Rich Roll,
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.760]   whose show I've done twice now,
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.760]   I like Rich a lot.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.760]   When he was coming up,
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.760]   this is what he was really known for.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.760]   Like today he's known as like
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.760]   the wise old man of the podcast.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:19.760]   I don't mean old.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.760]   He's not that much older than me,
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:21.760]   much better shape.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.760]   But you know,
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.760]   like he seems like an eminence
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.760]   in the podcasting world.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.760]   But he was known for doing
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.760]   these crazy ultra athletic events.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.760]   Like that was his thing was like,
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.760]   I'm going to do,
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.760]   he came out of nowhere
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.760]   and he started at the age of 40.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.760]   At the age of 40.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.760]   Now it's not quite fair
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:40.760]   because he was also like an Olympic hopeful
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.760]   D1 swimmer for Stanford.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.760]   So he's got the genes
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.760]   and there was a part in his life
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.760]   where he was a fantastic athlete,
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.760]   but then he had a alcohol problem.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.760]   And then that swimming fell apart,
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.760]   became a lawyer,
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.760]   finally had to get sober
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.760]   because of like the DUI,
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.760]   like he was going to get sent to jail.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.760]   And finally like rehab stuck.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:01.760]   So he put that addictive personality
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:02.760]   into eating junk food.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.760]   So he was like in bad shape,
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.760]   which is hard to imagine, right?
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.760]   So he's in and there's pictures in the book.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.760]   You should buy the book
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.760]   just to see the pictures of Rich Roll.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.760]   It's a different person.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.760]   Pictures like in his 30s.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.760]   I saw the cover.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.760]   So look at 10 years before that
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.760]   and he's, you know.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.760]   50, 75 pounds heavier or whatever.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.760]   And he just in his 40s.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.760]   So now he's clean,
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.760]   but he's eating junk food all the time.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.760]   Runs out of breath
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.760]   or walking up the stairs or something.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.760]   And it's like I got to change this or whatever.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.760]   And so he just gets into it.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.760]   He becomes a vegan
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.760]   and starts like serious athletic training
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.760]   and ends up
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.760]   becoming like a very successful
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:46.760]   like triathlons
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.760]   and then ultramarathons.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.760]   And then he does this thing
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:51.760]   where he does five Ironmans in seven days.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.760]   So it's like almost one Ironman per day.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.760]   Like he starts doing these crazy challenges.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.760]   The frustrating thing about the book
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:57.760]   is it's like
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.760]   I start changing how I eat
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.760]   and just like all the weight falls away.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.760]   You know, his body is like an athlete's body.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.760]   He starts training
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.760]   and he's like really good at these things, you know.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.760]   But it's a great book.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.760]   And that was his story.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:10.760]   And he was like on the cover of
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.760]   maybe it was Men's Health
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.760]   as the fittest man in the world or something.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760]   Like in his mid to late 40s.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:18.760]   So yeah,
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.760]   he became just like got in super good shape.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.760]   A very inspiring story for me.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.760]   I find it to be an inspiring guy.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:25.760]   I don't,
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.760]   I have not heard what happened with his house
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.760]   in the fires.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.760]   I know they evacuated.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:31.760]   He's in Calabasas,
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.760]   which was in the crosshairs.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.760]   I don't know what happened.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:36.760]   When I,
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:37.760]   I've been to his house once
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.760]   when I did his podcast the first time.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:40.760]   And that,
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.760]   that was after the 2017 fires
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:43.760]   had been kind of recently.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:44.760]   And he showed me,
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.760]   we like went down the road
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.760]   and he showed me like the burn line.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.760]   He's like there it is.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.760]   Like this was really close to my house.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.760]   And I think this one was much worse.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:53.760]   I hopefully,
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.760]   hopefully his house survived.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.760]   But I know they got out of there.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:57.760]   So anyways,
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.760]   it's a great book.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.760]   People forget that backstory.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:00.760]   Rich Roll has an awesome backstory.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:01.760]   He's an awesome guy.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:02.760]   All right.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.760]   Then I got into my,
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.760]   this is my like I need to learn math
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.760]   because my,
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.760]   my back hurts
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760]   and I'm in surgery
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   and my mind still works.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.760]   So that's what I'm going to do.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.760]   So I read Why Machines Learn
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.760]   by Anil Anathaswamy,
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.760]   a well-known science reporter.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.760]   It's a book about
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.760]   the mathematics behind machine learning,
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.760]   sort of starting with the beginning
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.760]   with like perceptrons
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.760]   and then moving all the way up
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:28.760]   to what's happening
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.760]   with like deep learning networks.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.760]   And I don't really know
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:32.760]   who the book is for
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.760]   outside of like me.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:35.760]   Right.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760]   Because it's,
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.760]   it's mathy.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.760]   It's not all the math.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   It's not a textbook.
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.760]   Right.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.760]   So it's like not,
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.760]   not all the math you need to know,
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.760]   but it's also,
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.760]   you know,
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.760]   multivariate derivatives are in there.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.760]   So there's still math,
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.760]   like you got to know math
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.760]   to like follow it.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.760]   But he's just giving you enough math
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.760]   that if you know math,
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:53.760]   you're like,
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.760]   oh,
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.760]   I get a sense of how this works.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:56.760]   Right.
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:57.760]   So it's kind of,
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.760]   I don't know who the audience is.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.760]   But because I'm a computer scientist,
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:00.760]   but I'm not a machine learning person.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:01.760]   So it's like,
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.760]   oh, cool.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:03.760]   This,
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.760]   I see what you're doing here.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.760]   Right.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:06.760]   So like I can come away
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.760]   and understand better
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:08.760]   about like what's happening
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:09.760]   with support vector machines.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:10.760]   Right.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.760]   Why you might want to take
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760]   like a,
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.760]   a particular vector
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.760]   and you want to sample it up
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:17.760]   into a higher dimensional space
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.760]   where you have more of a chance
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.760]   of actually finding a clean margin
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.760]   on your hyperplane
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:22.760]   that you can actually have
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:23.760]   like an optimal boundary on.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.760]   The problem is
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.760]   you can't actually do
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.760]   these optimal hyperplane
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.760]   boundary algorithms
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:30.760]   in these multi,
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.760]   high multidimensional spaces.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.760]   It's too computationally expensive.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.760]   But if you use
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:36.760]   these special types of functions,
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.760]   you can actually compute these,
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.760]   you can compute these planes
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.760]   and discover them
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.760]   without using just like
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.760]   low dimensional computation,
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760]   without actually having to leave
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:47.760]   from the high dimensions
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.760]   and therefore find
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.760]   these really good boundaries
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:51.760]   that would otherwise be hard
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:52.760]   to separate spaces.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:53.760]   Like that's what
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.760]   support vector machines are.
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:55.760]   Like for me,
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.760]   it's useful.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.760]   I can't tell you exactly
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.760]   how the math works,
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.760]   but like I have a sense
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.760]   of like what type of math
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.760]   is involved.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.760]   So I'm a great market
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:06.760]   for this book.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.760]   I know more about the math
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.760]   and it's great too
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:10.760]   to understand why
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.760]   when deep learning came around,
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.760]   it just
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.760]   blew the doors off
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.760]   and frustrated everyone
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.760]   who had been working on the,
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.760]   I call it boring machine learning,
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:19.760]   but this sort of
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.760]   theoretically rigorous,
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.760]   provable,
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:24.760]   this is these algorithms
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.760]   and here's what we're doing
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.760]   and here's how the math works.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.760]   And these guys came along
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.760]   with these multi-layered
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:30.760]   huge number parameter models
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:31.760]   and were like,
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.760]   "I don't know.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:33.760]   Let's just train the hell
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.760]   out of this thing."
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:35.760]   And they were like,
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.760]   "No, this won't work.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.760]   It's going to overfit.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:38.760]   That's not how this works."
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:39.760]   And it just worked.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.760]   They made it bigger
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   and it just got better.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.760]   So it must have been frustrating
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:43.760]   for the mathematicians.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.760]   So it's kind of a mathy book,
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:47.760]   but I got this right.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.760]   This is the part of my recovery
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:49.760]   when my back started hurting
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.760]   and I was like,
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.760]   "Okay, well,
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:52.760]   I can still use my mind."
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.760]   So I got that book
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:54.760]   from one of my labyrinth books
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:55.760]   in Princeton
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:56.760]   over the Christmas break
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.760]   and just enjoyed that.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:20:59.760]   All right.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.760]   Then I also read Burn Math Class,
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.760]   which I actually started this book
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.760]   right before my surgery
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.760]   when my mobility was restricted
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:08.760]   as I was waiting for the surgery
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.760]   and then I finished it in January.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.760]   And this is a crazy book.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.760]   This is Jason Wilkes' book.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.760]   I love it.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.760]   Jesse stole my copy.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.760]   I bought another copy.
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.760]   I don't think he wrote
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:19.760]   everything else about this,
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:20.760]   but it's this crazy program
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:21.760]   of a book
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.760]   where he basically just derives
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:23.760]   from his own first principles
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:24.760]   all of mathematics
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.760]   up to multidimensional calculus.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.760]   And just from scratch,
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.760]   like why,
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.760]   it's not here's a chain rule.
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:32.760]   It's like let's derive,
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.760]   like get to like
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.760]   why the chain rule works.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.760]   So I don't know.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:38.760]   I think it's kind of a tour de force.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.760]   He formatted the whole thing in LaTeX.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.760]   He wrote it in a few months.
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:44.760]   It's a little bit crazy.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.760]   There's these like long extended diagrams
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.760]   between like mathematics
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.760]   and like the author of the book.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.760]   It's a little bit strange,
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.760]   but this mathematical program is fantastic.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.760]   So I followed this all the way up.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:58.760]   I lost steam at the very end.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.760]   I got through like multidimensional derivatives
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:02.760]   for calculus,
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:03.760]   like the last 30 pages
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.760]   I kind of lost steam on,
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.760]   but I got through basically all of it.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:07.760]   Anyways, this was me,
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.760]   like my mind works
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760]   even if my body doesn't.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:10.760]   And I think that book
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.760]   should be more well known.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.760]   It should have had a better title.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:13.760]   This guy, Jason,
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.760]   if you're out there,
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.760]   you're a creative guy.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:17.760]   You're obviously very, very smart.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.760]   Write more books about math.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.760]   Be the Sean Carroll
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.760]   or the Brian Green of mathematics.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760]   You could do it.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.760]   You should find him and tell him that.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.760]   It's a cool book,
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:26.760]   but Burn Math Class
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.760]   is not the right title.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   And then I read
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.760]   The Intentional Father by John Tyson.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.760]   It was a book on parenting adolescent boys.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.760]   My oldest is 12.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:37.760]   I was like, "Oh, I need that advice."
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.760]   So I grabbed this book on Kindle.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:40.760]   It was more Christian than I thought.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.760]   I didn't realize it was like super Christian.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.760]   Not necessarily a bad thing, right?
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.760]   I mean, religions have good ideas for parenting.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:47.760]   I'm still digesting it.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:51.760]   I think Tyson's approach is very structured.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.760]   We are, as a father...
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.760]   So it's about being a father to adolescent boys.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   Right in my wheelhouse.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.760]   It's a very structured approach.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.760]   We're going to do these initiation routines
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:03.760]   and set aside this time
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   and have these conversations every morning.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.760]   It was a lot of structure
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:08.760]   that maybe I'd be comfortable with,
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.760]   but I'm letting the ideas marinate.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.760]   But I'm looking for good parenting books.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.760]   That's a call-out to the audience.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.760]   I'm about to hit adolescence fallout.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.760]   So if people have good books for that,
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.760]   especially like boys, fathers' boys,
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   send those along to jesse@caldewport.com.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.760]   I need to read basically all of those.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.760]   I already see it coming.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.760]   The emotional, everything.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.760]   It's for real, folks.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.760]   All right, that's all I got for today.
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.760]   Thank you for listening.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.760]   We'll be back next week with another episode.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.760]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.760]   Hey, if you liked today's discussion about distraction,
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.760]   you might also like episode 321,
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:51.760]   which is about escaping your phone.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.760]   Check it out. I think you'll like it.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.760]   So there was this period, it was less than a week,
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.760]   but it was a period in which I was constantly using my phone.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.760]   It punctuated everything that was going on in my life.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.760]   And I'll tell you, here's my review of that period.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.760]   It was terrible.
