[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   How much sunlight should we get each day
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.200]   in the shorter days of winter and in the fall?
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.800]   And when should this be done?
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.680]   In the Jeffrey study,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.680]   it was clear that there was circadian regulation.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.880]   As you mentioned, getting that sunlight, excuse me,
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.040]   getting that red light, infrared light into one's eyes
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.840]   early in the day was important.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.520]   If I'm living a standard life of work and job
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.000]   and people are managing kids and all sorts of things,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.720]   sometimes it's hard to get into the sunlight
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.640]   because you're just following a schedule.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.080]   How much time each day do you recommend,
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.920]   independent of anything related to getting sunlight
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.000]   in one's eyes for circadian rhythm setting?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.280]   So how much time, what time of day,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.480]   and what frequency across the week?
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.460]   Excellent question, and you've hit on exactly the issue.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.240]   Based on Glenn Jeffrey's studies,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.680]   based on another study that was actually done in Brazil,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.560]   it was actually an interventional study in COVID
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.560]   that showed that just 15 minutes a day for seven days
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.280]   was enough to actually get people with COVID
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.520]   out of the hospital faster.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.120]   This was a randomized placebo-controlled,
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.080]   double-blinded, amazing study, 940 nanometers.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.640]   So when I talked to Glenn Jeffrey about this,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.040]   he says he sees it in humans, he sees it in bees,
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.000]   he sees it in insects, it's all the same.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.920]   The mitochondria behave exactly the same.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.920]   When you say 940 nanometers,
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.960]   you're talking about long wavelength,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.440]   like coming from an artificial source?
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.320]   Correct. Okay.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.560]   Yeah, that was 940, and it was actually very low.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.480]   It was about 2.9 milliwatts per square centimeter.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.520]   So lower energy.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.520]   Most people are not going to own a far-red
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.160]   or an infrared light.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.200]   So I just want to emphasize again for people,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.920]   you can get that wavelength
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.160]   and all the other relevant wavelengths from the sun.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.000]   Exactly.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.320]   That's your red light therapy, folks.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.840]   Exactly, and this is what I'm trying to say.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.080]   It's like, this is not like some powerful laser
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.080]   that they were using.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.880]   This is 2.9 milliwatts.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.160]   I mean, sunlight,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.160]   all sunlight is about 100 milliwatts per centimeter squared.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.880]   By time it reaches-
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.720]   Through the atmosphere.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.560]   Through the atmosphere.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.640]   Yeah, so 130 when it hits the atmosphere.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.680]   By the time it hits you, it's about 100.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.680]   If you're looking at just infrared light,
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.440]   we're talking about 20 milliwatts per square centimeter.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.720]   And so this was 2.9 at a very specific wavelength.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.880]   So something that's completely doable, okay?
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.720]   And so what they did,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.480]   it was 15 minutes a day for seven days.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.240]   And what Glenn Jeffrey was telling me is that Roger,
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.720]   he says, "Roger, it doesn't matter if it's in insects,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.760]   "if it's in bees, if it's in humans."
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.600]   Once you hit a certain point, 15, 20 minutes,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.120]   diminishing marginal utility.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.520]   The improvement after that point is so minimal
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.960]   that you only need about 15 to 20 minutes.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.800]   That's why he was able to do his experiment
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.560]   in the eye for three minutes was all that was necessary.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.080]   So is this 15 minutes outside
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.960]   in the first three hours of your conventional day,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.780]   as I call it?
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.620]   'Cause people will say,
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.200]   "Well, the sun comes up later this hour."
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.440]   Conventional day, meaning after the sun
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.240]   has crossed the horizon, he has risen.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.400]   I don't think it matters.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.600]   I don't really think it matters.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.520]   I think what would matter
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.920]   is if there's a lot of ultraviolet light,
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.400]   which would be when the sun is high.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.080]   And for people who are skin sensitive,
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.920]   that could be an issue.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.840]   But if you're covering up, it doesn't matter.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.180]   And here's the issue.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.000]   The issue is that when you need it the most
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.520]   in the wintertime is when it's the hardest to get.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.120]   So you really have to make a concerted effort.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.200]   And for a lot of people,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.920]   and this is what happens probably right after November
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.840]   and probably going through to mid-January
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.000]   is this is what happens.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.760]   People get up in the morning, they go to their car,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.640]   they get into their car, they drive to work,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.200]   the sun's not up yet.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.000]   They get to their work, the sun comes up,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.320]   but they're inside.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.120]   Then what happens is they get done with work.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.520]   The sun is already down.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.360]   They come home from work.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.200]   And so there literally is weeks on end that occur
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.000]   where they're not even getting 15 minutes of sunlight.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.520]   And I think this is the reason why
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.680]   we have the influenza surge at this time.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.860]   If you look to see, the EPA did a study
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.080]   and they looked at Americans.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.660]   93% of our time is spent inside.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.680]   86% inside a building, 6% to 7% inside of a vehicle.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.540]   - And this is a relatively new thing.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.120]   I mean, certainly when I was growing up,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.320]   if I came home and had a snack after school,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.080]   I was getting kicked out of the house to go outside.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.540]   It was routine for parents to tell kids
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.260]   they had to go outside.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.720]   And I think there's also, it's also the case,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.800]   as you mentioned, that we're working later
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.920]   or at least on devices later into the evening,
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.880]   which means there's more exposure to short wavelength light
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.540]   from devices and artificial sources.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.660]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.200]   So my recommendation,
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.060]   which is what the original question was,
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.540]   is take your lunch break outside.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.900]   It's something as simple as getting outside,
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.140]   even if it's at lunchtime.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.340]   Yes, the ultraviolet is probably the highest at that point.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.740]   But if that's the only time
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.020]   that you're gonna get sunlight, take it.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.660]   Now for some, you know, we can say this,
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.440]   I can say this, I live in Southern California.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.660]   I'm blessed by 300 and some odd days of sunlight every year.
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.000]   What do you do when you're in Boston?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.260]   What do you do if you're in New York?
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.020]   What do you do if you're in England and Sweden
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.100]   and these places where there isn't a lot of light?
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.180]   Well, there's a study that was done
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.700]   looking at infrared lamps, right?
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.260]   So you've gotta be careful there
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.260]   because if the infrared lamps are too high in amplitude,
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.220]   this result from infrared light in the body
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.540]   is something known as a biphasic response.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.640]   And that's really important to understand.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.980]   Don't come into this
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.500]   if you're gonna get a red light therapy
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.460]   and think that more is better
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.580]   because more may not be better.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.300]   You actually could do detriment
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.260]   if you have the red light at too high of a level.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.380]   So I would match it to what we're getting from the sun.
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.460]   As you said, the sunlight is your best infrared or red lamp.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.580]   So there was a study that was done looking at well-being
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.420]   and they did a red light lamp, infrared light.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.820]   So it was coupled with 850, I think was the nanometer.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.540]   So that is definitely in the infrared spectrum.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.540]   - Yeah, you can't see that.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.380]   - You cannot see it.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.820]   And they had it set up at a desk
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.140]   that some guy was sitting in front of
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.700]   for four hours a day for eight weeks.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.020]   And they did the study and they did it in the summertime
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.340]   and they did it in the wintertime.
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.060]   And this is really telling.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.460]   There was no effect on the subject
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.260]   when they looked at those that had it in the summertime.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.940]   I would say probably because they were getting plenty
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.940]   of infrared light elsewhere.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.380]   They only showed a statistically significant effect
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.900]   in the wintertime.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.420]   And so if you look at influenza,
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.900]   I would even go beyond that.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.660]   Look at a chart of the United States
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.700]   throughout the entire year
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.380]   and look at all of the natural causes of death,
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.980]   not just influenza and pneumonia.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.340]   Look at cardiac disease.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.700]   Look at kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.460]   All of those deaths go up all at the same time
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.140]   and they all go up about one to three weeks
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.500]   after the shortest day of the year.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.580]   And they all come down and they all are at the nadir
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.820]   about one to three weeks after the longest day of the year.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.460]   When you see that and you just start to just digest
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.060]   what you're seeing there,
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.660]   and then you start to understand
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.180]   that infrared light from the sun,
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.380]   which we have filtered out with LEDs and all this,
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.620]   we can get to that, all of that's gone,
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.700]   that we're spending 93% of our time indoors.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.940]   Put that all together and the fact that infrared light
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.380]   helps the mitochondria and the fact that the mitochondria
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.100]   is at the sort of the core of all of these chronic diseases
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.100]   that we're battling.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.860]   It really wakes you up and you start to realize
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.740]   that maybe the lowest hanging fruit
