[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   number 11 and great to have you all on this live webinar.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.360]   Thanks so much for joining us.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.600]   I hope you had a great week and that you're trusting in the Lord
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.760]   for your life and for the lives of those whom you love,
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.880]   and that you're just walking in the blessings of Christ.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.400]   It's been a busy and a full week and a busy and a full day here at Kindred,
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.800]   and I know that that's true for all of you as well,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.320]   but we do look forward to a wonderful hour here looking at theology exam number 11.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.560]   We're looking at the subject of man as male and female,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.720]   theology exam number 11,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.320]   and I think this is going to be a good study for us tonight.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.800]   For our opening devotional tonight,
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.600]   I'd like to take us to Matthew Chapter 3, verses 16 and 17.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.040]   It might be an unexpected passage to look at dealing with the subject of man as male and female,
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.760]   but I trust you'll see the connection.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.840]   I want to introduce this topic in a roundabout way,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.880]   and I think you'll see the connection to our study tonight.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.280]   But this is from Matthew 3,
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.160]   verses 16 and 17,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.520]   which is the scene of the baptism of Jesus,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.000]   and the text reads in verse 16,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.720]   "And when Jesus was baptized,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.040]   immediately he went up from the water,
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.560]   and behold, the heavens were open to him,
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.080]   and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.120]   Behold, a voice from heaven said,
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.120]   'This is my beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased.'"
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.160]   That is a beautiful picture of the persons of the Trinity.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.040]   You have there the Son, Jesus Christ,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:11.080]   in the Jordan River being baptized by John the Baptist at the beginning of his public ministry.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.120]   You have the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on the Son,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.080]   Jesus Christ, and we see that the Son in his earthly life and ministry was empowered by the Spirit,
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.280]   was led by the Spirit of God,
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.480]   and then we see the affirmation of the Father where it says,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.720]   "Behold, a voice from heaven said,
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.160]   'This is my beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased.'"
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:53.160]   This isn't the last time that the Father is going to express his delight in the perfections of his Son.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.240]   You'll remember in Matthew 17,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.000]   there's the passage of Christ's transfiguration where the Father says,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.560]   "This is my beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.520]   Listen to him."
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.480]   So you'll remember from our study on the Trinity,
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.320]   God is three persons,
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.400]   each person is fully God,
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.480]   and yet not three gods,
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.440]   there's one God,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.040]   Triunity or Trinity.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.400]   So you see God the Father expressing his delight in the person of God the Son.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.440]   "This is my beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased."
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.240]   So you have your distinction.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.040]   You have Jesus the Son being baptized,
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.280]   you have the Spirit of God descending on the Son,
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.000]   you have the Father declaring his joy in the Son,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.600]   and yet at the same time,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.760]   you have essential harmony or essential unity.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.160]   You don't have any type of competition,
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.480]   you don't have any type of friction between the persons of the Trinity,
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.400]   you have each person working in perfect harmony and unity.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.240]   That is a beautiful picture of the relationships that
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.400]   exist within the unity of the Trinity.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.440]   So just think through with me for a minute
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.640]   the relationships between the Father,
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.960]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.720]   The Son, as you know,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.560]   comes in obedience to the Father's will.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.840]   He submits to the Father,
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.080]   and he accomplishes the Father's plan of redemption.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.240]   We have passages like John 4,
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.360]   verse 34, where Jesus said,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.440]   "My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work."
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.040]   So this coming of the Son,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.200]   Jesus Christ to this world is not of the Son's initiative,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.480]   it's the Father's initiative.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.040]   The Son comes to fulfill the plan of the Father.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.440]   John 8, verse 42,
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.400]   Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father,
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.760]   you would love me for I came from God and I'm here.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.840]   I came not of my own accord,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.600]   but he sent me."
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:33.200]   So the Son comes to this earth in submission to the Father's will.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.360]   At the Garden of Gethsemane, you remember Jesus was praying,
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.320]   "My Father, if it is possible,
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.680]   let this cup pass from me,
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.640]   nevertheless, not as I will,
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.840]   but as you will."
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.760]   So you have two persons of equal essence.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.840]   The Father is fully God and the Son is fully God.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.680]   The Son is co-equal with the Father in essential deity,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:07.720]   and yet the Son comes in perfect submission to the Father's authority.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.680]   Then you have the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.760]   How does the Holy Spirit work in relation to the Son?
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.360]   Well, if you read the gospel records,
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:29.640]   you know that the Spirit comes and empowers the Son and his public ministry.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.040]   Jesus comes to this earth,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.240]   the Spirit empowers the Son,
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.840]   and the Spirit leads the Son through his earthly ministry.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.400]   Luke 4, verse 1 says,
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.600]   "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.960]   returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness."
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.080]   So the Son is led by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.480]   Verse 14, "Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee and report about him,
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.760]   went out through all the surrounding country."
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.520]   Verse 16 says, "He came to Nazareth where he had been brought up,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.720]   and as was his custom,
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and he stood up to read,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.000]   and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.640]   He enrolled the scroll and found a place where it was written,
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.480]   'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.240]   because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.'"
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.040]   So the Son is the Messiah, the anointed one.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:42.360]   He is anointed by the Holy Spirit and the Spirit empowers the Son.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.680]   Watch this, "In order to fulfill the Father's plan,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.640]   in order to fulfill the Father's will."
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.640]   So we could say that the Spirit comes in submission to the Son,
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:03.200]   so that the Son will fulfill his submission to the Father.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.240]   Many passages speak of this relationship.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.000]   "In this day and age, the Spirit fills the Church of God,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   empowers the Church to minister the gospel of the Son."
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.240]   John 16, verse 13, "When the Spirit of truth comes,
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   he will guide you into all the truth,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.920]   for he will not speak on his own authority,
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.000]   but whatever he hears, he will speak,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.640]   and he will declare to you the things that are to come.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.280]   He will glorify me, that is Christ,
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.200]   for he will take what is mine and declare it to you."
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.560]   So the Spirit's goal in this day and age is to shine
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.480]   a giant spotlight on the Son and his perfect work,
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.680]   and glorify the Son.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:54.040]   The Spirit is delighted whenever the Son is exalted,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.960]   as is the Father is delighted in that as well.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.360]   So you have this beautiful relationship
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.320]   between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.640]   You have essential unity.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.200]   Remember, each person is fully God,
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.920]   yet you have these distinction of roles.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.120]   You have the Spirit submitting to the Son
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.680]   and desiring that the Son receive all glory and praise.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.040]   You have the Son submitting to the Father
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.160]   and coming in obedience to the Father's will.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.680]   You have essential unity and yet distinction of roles,
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.560]   what theologians call ontological equality,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.400]   that is equality of essence and economic subordination,
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.200]   that is submission in terms of roles,
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.240]   as the Son submits to the Father and the Spirit to the Son.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.920]   So Bruce Ware has said it well when he said this.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.640]   "God works as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit,
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.760]   with each person accomplishing the specific work
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.360]   that each one is responsible to do."
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.960]   Within the carrying out of these roles,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.920]   there seems to be a clear relationship
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.240]   in which the Father is supreme in authority,
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.280]   the Son submits fully to the will of the Father,
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.160]   and the Spirit seeks to carry for the work of the Son
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.560]   to the ultimate praise of the Father.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.400]   The distinctions in their work, then,
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.640]   must be recognized if we are to understand,
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:42.200]   rightly, the outworking of God's purposes and plans.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.360]   Now, I know what many of you might be thinking
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.480]   on this webinar.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.200]   You might be saying, "But Dan,
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.280]   we finished the doctrine of the Trinity, right?
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.400]   I mean, we finished the doctrine of God.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.560]   We're on to anthropology, the doctrine of man.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.520]   You know, my essay's done on the Trinity.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:04.160]   Why are we going back to the doctrine of the Trinity?
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:10.400]   Why is it important for us to review this doctrine?"
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.040]   And I wanted to approach the subject of gender,
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.240]   male and female, and the relationships
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:23.560]   that exist between genders
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.080]   by starting with the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.720]   I think we need to start here.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.680]   I think as we talk through the whole issue
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.080]   of complementarianism,
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.360]   the truth that male and female are equal in value,
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.080]   in worth, in dignity,
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.880]   and yet play different roles in the family and the church,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.120]   I think we need to start with how the persons of the Trinity
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.520]   relate to each other and respond to each other
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:01.320]   just to put this whole discussion in its proper context.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.560]   I want to start here because I believe
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.560]   that if we don't start with God
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.960]   and with the persons of the Trinity,
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.440]   and if we just teach, you know, bare complementarianism,
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.080]   we teach the functions
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.920]   and we teach the roles that are taught in Scripture
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.760]   without putting it in context of man
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.800]   is made in the image and likeness of God.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.080]   We are made to reflect God's beauty.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.360]   We are made to reflect God's glory,
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.120]   to live in relationship with him,
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.320]   and to reflect something of the beauty of who he is.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   And so if we don't start with God
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:50.120]   and how the Father, Son, and Spirit relate to each other,
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.280]   then you might agree with the teaching of complementarianism.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.720]   You might say, "Well, I agree that, you know,
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.120]   husbands should be leaders of their wives
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.080]   and wives should submit to their husbands,
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.600]   and I agree that pastors should be,
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.480]   and elders should be male,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.200]   and that females shouldn't preach in the church."
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.520]   I mean, you may agree with the bare facts
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.560]   of complementarianism,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.600]   but if you don't see it in context of the relationships
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.800]   that exist within the unity of the Trinity,
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.640]   then you're not going to love complementarianism.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.760]   You're not going to delight in it.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.960]   You're not going to find something
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.320]   that's beautiful and wonderful
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.120]   in the roles that God has designed
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.280]   unless you see how those roles reflect
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.680]   something of the beauty of the Triune God himself.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.280]   And I think that's why it's important to start again
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.120]   with the doctrine of the Trinity
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.560]   and then reason from there.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.480]   If God is three persons
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.440]   and the Father is co-equal with the Son
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.360]   and co-equal with the Spirit,
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.720]   and yet the Son delights to submit to the Father
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.640]   and the Spirit delights to submit to the Son,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.320]   then does it not follow from who God is
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.320]   that male and female can be equal
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.640]   in value, dignity, worth, and rank,
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.280]   and yet play different roles in the church
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.400]   and in the family,
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.840]   and that those distinctions
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.960]   would not just merely be functional?
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.440]   That is, it's not just meant to serve a practical end,
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.280]   even though there are practical benefits
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.760]   from those types of role distinctions.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.400]   It's not merely functional.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.920]   That's not our argument.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.920]   It's reflective of the person
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   of who God is himself.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.640]   It is something that is beautiful
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.440]   because it reflects something of God's likeness.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:13.440]   And if you take away the idea of complementary roles
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.680]   in the church and in the family,
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.080]   and you say that male and female are equal,
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.280]   therefore they're interchangeable,
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.680]   that they don't have distinct functions and roles,
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.320]   then you lose something of how male and female
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.320]   can reflect the likeness of the triune God himself.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.560]   I'd pray that the result of our study tonight,
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.040]   that you wouldn't just be able
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.280]   to recite the bare facts of complementarianism
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.000]   or to say that you intellectually agree
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.440]   that these teachings are true.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.600]   My prayer is that as you see this in context,
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.000]   that you would cherish this doctrine,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.960]   that you would love it,
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.600]   that you would see something of the beauty of it,
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.960]   that it would be precious to you.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.480]   My prayer is that you would understand the texts
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.640]   which teach complementarianism versus egalitarianism
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.640]   and be able to defend distinction of roles from scripture.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.120]   But I hope that you and I go beyond that
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.000]   and that we would love this doctrine,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.040]   not only because it's taught in the word of God,
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   but to submit to God-given authority
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.480]   is to be like Christ himself.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.480]   And to understand equality yet diversity of roles
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.400]   is to see something of the beauty of God himself.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.960]   And so I wanna talk through that with you tonight.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   Just some practical, just some implications here.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.400]   I'm gonna skip some of this language.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.120]   But as I was just thinking through this
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.600]   and this is fresh on my mind
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   and on just how does this impact our lives
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.640]   and how does this impact my life and yours?
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.960]   I was just thinking through some fresh implications.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.720]   Number one, and I believe this,
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.280]   you're only a leader when you yourself are able to submit.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.280]   And that's, I think, a good encouragement for not only men,
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.960]   but women as well who are in places of authority.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   We are all called to submit to someone
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.340]   that God has placed over us.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.880]   And I've just been reminded of this myself
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.880]   that I'm only a leader as much as I am able to submit.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.340]   I'm called to submit to God's word.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.520]   I'm called to submit to Christ
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.520]   as Christ's authority is real in my life.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.840]   And I submit to Christ as I study his word.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.680]   I'm called to submit to my fellow elders and pastors
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.920]   in the local church.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.720]   I'm called to submit to governmental authorities.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.360]   I'm called to submit even in the sense
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.840]   of submitting with accountability to church membership
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.840]   and the members of the church who hold me accountable.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.840]   I'm called to submit to God-given authority.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.800]   And I can't say to my wife or to my children
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   or to members of my church as a pastor,
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.880]   I can't say to them, well, you need to submit to me
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.800]   unless I myself am submitting to the authorities
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.360]   that God has placed over me.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.760]   And that's just something that's fresh
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.280]   and really real a reminder on my heart
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:04.040]   that a leader is called to submit.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:09.040]   And when a leader submits to the authorities over him,
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.980]   then he makes it a joy for people to submit to him.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.020]   If I'm submitted to God's word and submitted to Christ,
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:24.020]   then my wife will find submission to me and marriage a joy.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.880]   And if I'm not submitted to God's word,
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.000]   then submission to my leadership in the home
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.420]   will be very burdensome for my wife and for my children.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.560]   And so you're only a leader
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.200]   when you yourself are able to submit.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.380]   Number two, this is just some fresh reflection on this.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.860]   True submission is not inferiority.
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:53.980]   It's not inferiority.
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.980]   It's equality of value, equality of rank,
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:04.140]   equality of dignity.
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.760]   It's being equally made in the image of God.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.220]   I mean, there is equality
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.840]   and then there is distinction of roles.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.100]   And so to be brought into submission
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.820]   to what God has placed over you
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.380]   is not to embrace inferiority.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:31.740]   Again, this is just some fresh reflections on this theme.
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.900]   I think there is, I mean, thinking through the whole topic
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.760]   of parenting adult children,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.700]   because that's a common counseling issue
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.820]   as well as something that's real in my life.
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.020]   I have two, I'm a brand new,
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.780]   I'm a rookie to parenting adult children,
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.780]   but I do have boys who are newly young adults.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:01.540]   And I think in parenting adult children,
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.260]   you have children who were once
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.700]   under your authority functionally,
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.740]   and now they are not under your authority.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:16.740]   They are, in some sense, they are now equals.
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.900]   There's more emphasis on the quality
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.740]   of being made in the likeness and image of God
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.580]   and less emphasis on the functional subordination
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.220]   that they have under your leadership.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.980]   And I believe that many parents struggle
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.080]   with this transition because they're still trying
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.340]   to relate to their children in terms of authority
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.940]   and control rather than developing that relationship
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.220]   as those who are equally made
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.100]   in the likeness and image of God.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:54.020]   And it just relates to this whole theme of there is both,
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:59.320]   equality of being equally made in God's likeness
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:04.660]   and there is functional subordination in the plan of God.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:11.100]   And then number three reflection is true submission
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:16.020]   is heart submission, it's heart submission.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.000]   The son didn't say to the father, well, I'll do it,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.360]   but I hate submitting to your authority.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.840]   He said, my food is to do the will of him
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.840]   who sent me and accomplish his work.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.360]   The son submitted with a full heart to the father
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.120]   because the son delighted
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.740]   in his relationship with the father.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.360]   So let me just talk to you guys
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.800]   as biblical counselors in training for a moment.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.440]   Much of biblical counseling is marriage counseling.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.800]   I think it's estimated in most counseling centers,
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:00.800]   60% of biblical counseling is marriage counseling.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.480]   Much of marriage counseling is due to a misunderstanding
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:13.600]   and an abuse of complementarian roles in marriage
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:22.120]   that somehow the husband has heard
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.200]   that he's the head of the home
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.200]   and he didn't hear the other part of Ephesians five
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.440]   that says that being the head of the home
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.120]   means you love your wife as Christ loves the church
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.900]   and you lay down your life for her.
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.560]   But he heard the first part that he's the head of the home.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.280]   And so he's calling the shots
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.080]   and he's telling people what to do.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.080]   And he's the boss and he'll justify it
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.520]   using some biblical text saying,
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.620]   well, see the Bible says that I'm the leader of the home.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.320]   So everyone needs to submit to me.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:01.480]   And then you have distortions on the wife's end as well.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.080]   But you see how this works that much of marriage counseling
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.240]   is helping people think through these roles
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.480]   and exactly the topic that we're looking at tonight
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   on a complementarian understanding of gender roles
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:22.200]   and thinking through that biblically and clearly.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.380]   And I think that's why this topic is so important
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.360]   for our training in biblical counseling.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.440]   That's why ACBC wants you to write this essay.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.520]   It's so practical.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.880]   And you're gonna have a hard time shepherding people
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.040]   through the abuses of this doctrine
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.520]   if you don't clearly understand the teaching yourself.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.960]   Would you see when the son submitted to the father,
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.800]   it's not just merely he did the father's will,
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.440]   but he delighted to do the father's will
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.720]   because he delighted in the father.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.520]   He delighted in that relationship.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.280]   He loved the father and the father delighted in him.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.640]   And it's out of that mutual joy and delight
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   in the perfections between the persons of the Trinity
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.640]   that came this wonderful submission where Jesus said,
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.100]   my food is to do the will of the father.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.600]   And what you see in a lot of marriages
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.400]   is you see people trying to force the function.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.760]   They're trying to force submission and headship,
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.520]   leadership and submission,
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.220]   apart from that mutual relationship of delight and joy.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:38.480]   And just saying it's because I delight in my wife
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.440]   that I lay down my life for her and vice versa.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.280]   It's because the wife says I delight
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.520]   in my husband's love for me.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.280]   And I delight in my relationship with him
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.560]   that I will joyfully submit to his leadership over me.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.920]   I think those are the things that we need to think through
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.320]   as biblical counselors.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.320]   And we wanna train counselors that understand this doctrine,
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.160]   can shepherd people through it
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.920]   and also live it out themselves.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   I think that where true submission is heart submission
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:21.600]   is where the rubber meets the road for all of us.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.280]   I think this is just,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.600]   I mean, all of us can be like that kid who said,
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.600]   I'm sitting down on the outside
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.480]   and I'm standing up on the inside.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.040]   And that's not true submission.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.880]   That's not the submission of Christ.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.840]   And this is something that is challenging for all of us
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.920]   and where we wanna lead our counselees
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.700]   as well as our own lives.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.560]   So let me read the exam question.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.320]   And then there's a typo here,
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.360]   but you guys will get the point here.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.520]   Describe the biblical understanding
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.920]   of manhood and womanhood
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.840]   from an egalitarian and complimentarian perspective,
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.080]   explain which view you embrace
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.960]   and outline which you believe to be most biblical.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.760]   Let me pray for us and then we'll get into the outline,
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.080]   but let me pause here and let me pray for our time.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.240]   Father, thank you for just this reminder
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.320]   of the beauty of who you are
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.440]   and the beauty of the relationships that exist
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.860]   between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.440]   We just praise you that Lord,
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.080]   we are made in your image and likeness
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.400]   and made to reflect your glory and beauty.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.800]   And we pray that Father,
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.560]   you would help us to understand gender roles
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.800]   as defined by scripture,
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.400]   not just so that we would grudgingly obey,
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.880]   but so that we might delightfully submit to your plan
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.920]   and that there would be something of a reflection
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.960]   of your glory in our marriages and our homes
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.800]   and in our churches.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.880]   And so bless our time tonight.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.460]   Thank you for each of my brothers and sisters
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.560]   who are working their way through this essay
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.080]   and pray that you would give them clear understanding.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.000]   We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.080]   Okay, on page one, just a brief overview.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.640]   We have some good material there.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.520]   I'm gonna let you read through that on your own,
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.460]   just a number of good works that you can look at.
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:43.320]   But let me move to the second page of your handout
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.880]   and take a look at man as male and female.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.080]   I'm not gonna go through this handout in slavish detail,
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.280]   but I will make a few points that will be helpful
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.840]   for the writing of your essay.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.740]   So why is this topic so important?
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.600]   Genesis one, verse 27,
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.120]   God created man in his own image, in the image of God,
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.180]   he created him male and female, he created them.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.520]   Genesis five, verse one, when God created man,
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.560]   he made him in the likeness of God, male and female,
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.960]   he created them and he blessed them
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.140]   and named them man when they were created.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.120]   Pretty simple, right?
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.040]   I mean, I think it's pretty clear, pretty straightforward.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.760]   It's amazing how much confusion there is in our society
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.200]   over this issue, how you got from male and female,
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.520]   he created them to the whole mess that we're in
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.820]   in our society over gender.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:47.640]   I don't know how we got here except for the doctrine of sin
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:52.000]   and rejection of the word of God, but here we are.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.720]   Would you agree that our society is confused about gender?
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:03.120]   I think that this is from an LA Times article
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.360]   on August 6th, 2015.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.040]   It's not on your handout, but let me read this.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.560]   It says, "Starting this fall, students applying
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.840]   to the University of California will have the option
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.080]   to choose among six gender identities
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.180]   listed on undergraduate admissions forms.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.480]   Male, female, trans male, trans female,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.040]   gender, queer, gender non-conforming."
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:36.980]   And then the sixth option is just different.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.700]   Different identity.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.580]   The identity choices official says,
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.980]   so this is state of California and this is the UC system.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.460]   So really smart people run this system,
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.800]   at least from a secular point of view.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.740]   And yet they have a lot of confusion about gender.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.380]   The official said that the identity choices are intended
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.280]   to help serve the student body of each campus.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.020]   One spokesman said, "When a university
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.540]   has better information on their student population,
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.740]   better decisions can be made without allocating
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.900]   the resources to support students."
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:18.980]   And just a whole lot of confusion on this issue.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:19.940]   And that's five years ago.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.940]   I think the choices have possibly expanded since then.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:31.420]   The California education code says that gender means sex
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.580]   and includes a person's gender identity
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.440]   and gender expression.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:43.100]   Gender expression means a person's gender related experience
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.700]   and behavior, whether or not stereotypically associated
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.620]   with a person's assigned sex at birth.
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:54.340]   So the California education code defines gender
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.340]   as one's chosen subjective self-expression,
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.760]   not that which is defined by biological sex.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:10.160]   So just a whole lot of confusion on this issue.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.480]   And then contrast that to the clear teaching of scripture,
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.480]   male and female, he created them.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.040]   And again, in Genesis five, verse one,
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.120]   male and female, he created them.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.160]   So we have to be clear because society is not clear.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.820]   We need to know what we believe
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:38.820]   because this is a very muddled in the world that we live in.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.640]   So the second issue would be the choice of the church,
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.760]   the choice of the church.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.720]   So we have two viewpoints and this is on your handout,
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.080]   the viewpoint of egalitarianism.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.660]   Egalitarianism would say that male and female
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.900]   are equal before God in their personhood,
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.500]   and there are no gender-based distinctions
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.900]   as to what roles male and female can fulfill
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.460]   in the family and in the church.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:14.740]   So the basic issue here is egalitarianism would say
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.740]   that male and female are equal,
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.060]   therefore they're interchangeable.
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.440]   There's no gender-based distinctions.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:30.780]   They would argue that gender-based distinctions
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.700]   are a result of the fall of man into sin.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:39.660]   And therefore, since we are in Christ,
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.740]   there's either a male or female,
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.660]   Genesis, Galatians three, verse 28.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:50.660]   And so these gender-based distinctions have been reversed.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:55.460]   They've been reversed through salvation in Christ.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:00.460]   And so that would be the viewpoint of egalitarianism.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.820]   Male and female are equal,
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.900]   and therefore they are interchangeable.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.340]   Complementarianism would be the viewpoint
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.580]   that male and female are equal before God
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.460]   in terms of dignity, personhood, and value,
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.340]   and they fulfill complementary roles
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.800]   in the family and in the church.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.700]   So I said, egalitarianism would say
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.380]   that gender-based distinctions are a result
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.920]   of the fall of man into sin.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:34.140]   Therefore in Christ, those distinctions are reversed.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:39.100]   Complementarianism teaches that gender-based distinctions
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.540]   were part of the original created order
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.420]   and were designed by God
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:48.420]   and were pronounced by God in the Genesis account
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.580]   to be very good.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.700]   God looked at all that he had made
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.200]   and he declared it to be very good.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:02.840]   The gender distinctions of male and female are good.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.620]   They're an expression of the goodness of God.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.460]   To assault or attack gender-based distinctions
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.820]   in our day and age is really to argue
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.860]   against the goodness of God.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:21.060]   I mean, every man should wake up every morning
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.540]   and say it's good to be a man.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.660]   It has biblical warrant to say that.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.420]   Every woman should wake up every morning
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.660]   and say it is good to be a woman.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:35.660]   I mean, that is the implication of Genesis chapter one.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.720]   God saw all that he had made
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.860]   and declared it to be very good.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:46.320]   And so complementarianism teaches
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.820]   that because gender-based distinctions
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.900]   were part of the created order,
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:59.320]   that salvation in Christ brings a reversal
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.860]   in the distortion of the roles.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.360]   It does not obliterate the distinctions themselves.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.720]   And you can read, if you wanna go deeper on this,
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.360]   you can read Wayne Grudem's
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.340]   Rediscovering Manhood and Womanhood.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.860]   He walks through the arguments that egalitarians make.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.620]   And I have a summary of that on your handout.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.020]   If you want that more in depth,
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.340]   you can look at his book,
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:27.500]   "Rediscovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood."
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.800]   But that's the basic argument.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:36.620]   The theological argument is where gender-based,
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.540]   gender distinctions part of the original created order
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.860]   or were they a result of the fall of man into sin?
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.140]   And Grudem does a good job arguing the point
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.540]   that gender distinctions were part
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.260]   of the original created order.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.760]   By the way, I know we differ a little bit
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.620]   on some of the chapters
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:59.820]   in Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology as ACBC.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:04.220]   But on this particular subject,
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.220]   I think Grudem has some of the most helpful
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:12.220]   materials out there just presenting a complimentarian view
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:17.220]   of gender roles and doing that with clarity
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.060]   and with precision, answering the arguments biblically,
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.420]   as well as being very balanced
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.620]   and pastoral in his presentation.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:31.420]   Now, the kindred doctrinal statement
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.180]   is really lifted from the Danvers statement.
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:39.340]   You'll find this exact same language in the Danvers statement
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.100]   that I gave to you on your Dropbox.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.720]   The Danvers statement was a statement written
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.140]   by the Council of Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.980]   And they have a very clear expression
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.980]   of what we mean by complimentarianism.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.980]   Let me read this for you.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.300]   They say that, "In the family,
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.180]   "husbands should forsake false,
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.680]   "harsh or selfish leadership
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.160]   "and grow in love and care for their wives.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.740]   "Wives should forsake resistance
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.620]   "to their husband's authority
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.360]   "and grow in willing, joyful submission
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.640]   "to their husband's leadership.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.620]   "In the church, redemption in Christ
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.080]   "gives men and women an equal share
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.200]   "in the blessings of salvation.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.740]   "Nevertheless, some governing and teaching roles
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.560]   "within the church are restricted to men."
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:32.880]   Now, on that page there on your handout,
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.600]   I would just circle the words family and church.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.400]   Okay, family and church.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.500]   Under the definition of complimentarianism,
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.760]   they fulfill complimentary roles
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.860]   in the family and in the church.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.300]   And then in the statement from the Danvers statement
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.060]   on Council of Biblical Manhood and Womanhood,
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.820]   the first statement, "In the family,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.620]   "husbands should forsake harsh or selfish leadership."
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:38:59.640]   And the second paragraph,
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.440]   "In the church, redemption in Christ
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.280]   "gives men and women an equal share
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.180]   "in the blessings of salvation."
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.660]   Our understanding of complimentarianism
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:14.140]   is that it is restricted to the family and the church.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:19.140]   Those are the two specific applications of gender roles.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:25.580]   It's not the idea that all men have leadership
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:30.260]   over all women or all women
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.620]   should have a submissive attitude to all men.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.580]   It's restricted in its application
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.220]   to the church and to the family.
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.420]   I remember working with one single brother
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.280]   in the church many years ago who had this idea
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.940]   that all women in the church
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.620]   should have a submissive attitude to him
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.100]   even though he wasn't married simply because he was a man.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.460]   And you can see that, I mean,
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.680]   the terrible implications of that kind of attitude
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:09.680]   and how I as a pastor needed to help him with that to say,
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.860]   it's not all women need to have
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.540]   submissive attitude to all men.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.960]   It's if you're married,
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.820]   then your wife is called to submit to you as a leader,
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.260]   but it's not this general idea.
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.940]   I think that's more of an Islamic idea
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.380]   of all women submitting to all men.
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.820]   I can tell you that when I worked in accounting
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.620]   at an accounting firm,
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:39.620]   I had a manager and a partner who were over me, both female.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:44.180]   And in that context,
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.380]   God had called me to submit to them
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.380]   as those who were over me in that company.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.420]   And it was a joy to do that.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:58.280]   They were great bosses and that was not a burden at all,
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.300]   but it's just the family and the church.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.540]   I think our definition of complementarianism
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.960]   would highlight those two applications.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.860]   And you wanna be on guard against a widening
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.300]   of the application to spheres
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.840]   that are not really addressed by scripture.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:21.420]   I'll go to bat for the church and the family.
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.700]   I believe that elders are to be men
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.180]   as qualified and defined by scripture.
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.420]   I believe that 1 Timothy 2,
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.420]   that a woman shouldn't preach in mixed settings over men
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.180]   and exercise authority over them in that way.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.240]   I believe that husbands are the head of the home
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.140]   and that they should love their wives
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.140]   as Christ loves the church
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.920]   and that wives should submit to their husbands
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.160]   as to the Lord.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.420]   And aside from that,
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.380]   I don't have a biblical warrant
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:42:00.380]   to widen the application of complementarianism
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.460]   to a wider sphere.
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.100]   And so you just wanna be on guard and careful of that.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.740]   It's not that all men everywhere
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.980]   have authority over all women,
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.480]   simply by virtue that they are men.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.140]   So if you move to, let me move to page three here
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:27.140]   and just give you some key truths on complementarianism.
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.580]   First is that gender is a creation of God.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.060]   I think we see that very clear,
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.140]   male and female made to be distinct.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:41.220]   Male and female are equal but not identical.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.220]   We do harm when we seek to eliminate the differences
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.320]   between male and female.
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:53.020]   And male and female are,
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:56.540]   were meant to be complimentary.
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.900]   If you look at the bullet point at the bottom of page three,
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.300]   Genesis two, verse 18,
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.820]   then the Lord God said,
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.780]   it is not good that the man should be alone.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.260]   I will make him a helper fit for him.
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.100]   The Hebrew term Ezer,
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.620]   a lofty word used to describe God himself.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.860]   It's not a demeaning term.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:17.540]   It's just, it's a term of strength.
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.760]   And it says for Adam,
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.740]   there was not found a helper fit for him.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.300]   So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.140]   And while he slept,
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.780]   took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.280]   And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man,
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.420]   he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.460]   And the man said, this at last is bone of my bones
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.340]   and flesh of my flesh.
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.880]   He shall be called woman because she was taken out of man.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.220]   Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:51.220]   and hold fast to his wife and they shall become one flesh.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:54.500]   So beautiful creation of God,
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:58.340]   male and female made to be complimentary.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:03.100]   If you move to the next page there on page four,
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.300]   Richard Davison writes,
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.020]   by building Eve from one of Adam's ribs,
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.100]   God appears to be indicating the mutual relationship,
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.820]   the singleness of life,
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:15.360]   inseparable unity in which men and women are joined.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.740]   The rib means solidarity and equality.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.140]   The phrase bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.580]   indicates that the person described
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.020]   is as close as one's body.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.540]   It denotes physical oneness and a commonality
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.420]   of concern, loyalty, and responsibility.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.820]   And as Peter Lombard has written,
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.980]   Eve was not taken from the feet of Adam to be a slave,
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.860]   nor from his head to be his ruler,
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:40.980]   but from his side to be his beloved partner.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.660]   The distinction of male and female
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.980]   is declared to be very good.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.980]   Genesis one verse 31,
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.460]   God saw everything that he had made and behold,
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.340]   it was very good and there was evening
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.820]   and there was morning the sixth day.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:00.780]   So if you look down on page four to letter B,
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.540]   you see there that a distinction in roles
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.060]   is intrinsic to the nature of God himself
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.660]   and therefore part of the image of God.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.700]   That was my purpose in reviewing in our devotional,
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:16.700]   the persons of the Trinity, father, son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.820]   Each person is fully God,
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.840]   yet there are not three gods, but one God.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:27.060]   And if you move to the next page,
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.900]   you find those terms ontological equality,
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.580]   which means equality of essence.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.120]   The father is equal to the son in terms of essence,
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.940]   attributes and nature of divinity,
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.620]   and then economic subordination
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.760]   in terms of function, role, or activity.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.440]   The persons of the Trinity differ
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:50.060]   in how they relate to each other and to creation.
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:57.020]   So moving to the box on page five,
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.940]   if equality and submission are both intrinsic
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:01.820]   to the nature of God as a Trinity
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.180]   and man is made in the image of God after his likeness,
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:09.340]   then we would expect to see some type of distinction
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.940]   in role between male and female.
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:15.100]   And that is exactly what we do find,
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.140]   1 Corinthians 11, verse three.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.460]   "But I want you to understand
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.280]   "that the head of every man is Christ,
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.900]   "the head of a wife is her husband,
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.220]   "and the head of Christ is God."
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.820]   Head means authority in verse three.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.840]   Grudem does a great job defending that.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.660]   There's been kind of attacks on that teaching.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.860]   Some would wanna redefine the term head,
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.760]   meaning source, instead of authority,
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.100]   but it's pretty clear in 1 Corinthians 11, verse three,
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.100]   that the head of every man is Christ,
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.400]   and that means authority.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.740]   The head of Christ is God, that means authority as well.
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.340]   And then the head of a wife is her husband.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.700]   Some would say in 1 Corinthians 11, verse three,
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:05.440]   that that's talking about a cultural issue
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.520]   that was relevant to the early church,
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.000]   but it's not relevant today.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.240]   And I would just walk you through this in saying,
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.280]   you know, that first statement,
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.900]   the head of every man is Christ,
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.040]   I mean, we just asked the question,
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.160]   is that a cultural statement?
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:28.000]   I think that's a theological statement, not a cultural one,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.680]   that the authority of every man is Christ.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:36.980]   That's not just relevant to the first century early church,
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:41.600]   that's relevant to all peoples everywhere.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.160]   And if you look at the third statement,
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.200]   the head of Christ is God,
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.160]   and that's talking about the relationship
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:51.320]   of God the Father and God the Son.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.280]   We would also have to conclude
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.720]   that's not a cultural statement,
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.480]   that's not just something that was relevant
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.400]   to the early church,
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:02.400]   that's relevant to people everywhere in all times.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.000]   And so how do you take that middle statement,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.920]   the head of a wife is her husband,
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.560]   and conclude that that's a cultural statement
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:18.560]   that was only applicable to the early church?
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.200]   If we're consistent and we say
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.920]   that the top statement is universal,
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.760]   and the bottom statement is a universal truth,
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.640]   then we have to be consistent
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.920]   and just interpret the verse in its context.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.140]   And we have no warrant to take that second statement
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.740]   and make that into a cultural statement
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.860]   that's not applicable to every generation.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.560]   The head of a wife is her husband,
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.560]   that's talking about the same concept
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.100]   of as the first and third statements,
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.080]   head means authority,
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.880]   and 1 Corinthians 11 goes on
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.800]   and talks about head coverings
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:07.400]   and just the symbol of authority
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.720]   that they were in that day.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:14.720]   And I'm not gonna be able to get into that subject tonight
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:18.080]   with the five minutes I have remaining,
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.560]   but it is a worthy study.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.800]   But it goes back to verse three
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.760]   that the head of a wife is her husband.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.320]   So I have a summary there of Wayne Grudem's,
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.720]   how he deals with the topic of egalitarianism
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.360]   versus complementarianism.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:43.920]   Okay, let me walk through some counseling scenarios
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.280]   and just try to whet your appetite
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.800]   for how this is practical in counseling.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.520]   I think this was something that was,
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.560]   some scenarios I'll walk through with me
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.600]   from Dr. Robert Jones
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.400]   of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.640]   I'm just talking through,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:06.120]   how do we see complementarianism gender roles
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:11.040]   show up in the counseling room and counseling ministry,
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.840]   and how do we address those things biblically?
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:18.280]   Well, you have some husbands who,
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.660]   I mean, let's just face it, they're tyrants, okay?
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.880]   They've taken this whole idea of headship
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.880]   and they've divorced it from the biblical context.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:33.920]   They don't see headship as an opportunity
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.040]   to express Christ-like servanthood
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:41.040]   and Christ-like sacrificial love.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.760]   They're taking kind of this military context
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.680]   of being the authority
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:52.680]   and then bringing that to their homes.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.100]   And so they're the commander
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:58.820]   of their wives and their children.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:03.820]   And so they're tyrants, they're the big boss at home.
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.700]   I'm the head of the home
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:10.460]   and that means everybody needs to do what I say.
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.120]   I think you know what I'm talking about there,
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:19.120]   and we know that situation that shows up often.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:22.600]   But then you have on the other side,
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.340]   the other extreme on the right-hand side,
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.560]   husbands who are passive.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:30.200]   And so they never take leadership.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:39.280]   It's a let go, let God type of issue.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.100]   They don't find jobs.
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:45.480]   They don't think of ways to improve the lot of the family.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.520]   They don't think of ways to shepherd their wives.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.040]   There's many ways that this shows up.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.920]   And I don't mean passive in terms of personality,
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.680]   I mean passive spiritually,
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.000]   passive in terms of their leadership role.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.120]   I've seen husbands who have very quiet personalities,
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.740]   but man, they're leaders in the home.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.080]   They know how to lead their wives
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.540]   and they know how to lead their kids
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:11.720]   and their kids respect them.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:16.920]   And then I've seen husbands who are very loud
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.280]   and kind of very outgoing personalities
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.920]   and yet spiritually, they're very passive at home
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.800]   and they don't know how to lead their wives
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.680]   and lead their children.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.360]   So it's not a personality issue of loud versus quiet.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.240]   It really is taking spiritual leadership
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.840]   versus being spiritually passive.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.720]   So you have these two extremes
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.480]   and then you've got this whole spectrum
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.400]   of everything in between, okay?
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:47.220]   So you have husbands who gravitate more to the left
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:51.500]   where they're just gravitate more toward cold authority.
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:56.000]   And then you have husbands that gravitate more to the right
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   and really take a passive role in their homes.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.300]   And that's just sort of some categories
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.700]   to put some counseling scenarios in.
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.180]   And then what about the wives?
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:18.180]   So you have on one hand down at the bottom left,
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:21.740]   you have wives that are dominant.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.780]   So let's just face it.
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.780]   We have women who they have taken authority in their homes.
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:32.000]   And again, it's not a personality issue.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   I have seen wives who are very outgoing and vivacious
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.100]   and just personality wise,
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:46.000]   they are louder than their husbands are.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.500]   But spiritually speaking,
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.260]   they are submitted to their husbands
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:56.180]   and they follow his leadership and vice versa.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.660]   So this is not a personality type.
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:59.900]   This is a spiritual issue.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:04.540]   You have wives that really are taking leadership
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.380]   of their homes.
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:10.020]   You see, I mean, you hear wives say,
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.060]   well, he's not leading.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.100]   So somebody needs to lead.
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:17.780]   And so I'm gonna do it and other things as well.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.060]   And so you have that on the left-hand side.
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:22.660]   And then you have on the right-hand side,
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.060]   and we can use the word doormat.
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:28.480]   I think the Denver statement has the word servile,
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:32.620]   not biblical submission,
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:37.620]   which is strength that is submitted to God-given authority.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.820]   If you look at the Proverbs 31 woman,
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.080]   she was not a doormat.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.700]   She was not servile.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:47.860]   I mean, she was strong.
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.040]   It says even her arms were strong,
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.280]   spiritually strong, physically strong.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.860]   She ran a business.
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:57.060]   She invested money.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.820]   She had spheres of authority.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.240]   Why spheres of authority?
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:04.280]   I mean, I always get very concerned
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.860]   when I see husbands who have to make
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:09.180]   every single decision in the home.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:13.460]   That's not the Proverbs 31 woman.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:17.740]   She had wide spheres of authority
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:19.940]   that were submitted to her husband, to be sure.
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:24.940]   But she considered a field and bought it.
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:30.380]   Doesn't say that she asked her husband if she could buy it.
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.540]   I mean, there was just freedom there.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:35.100]   And when you see that in healthy, godly marriages,
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:40.100]   you see this trust and this built up respect
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.980]   where a wife is submitted to her husband's authority,
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:47.620]   but has wide spheres of authority herself
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:50.180]   that she can run in.
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.300]   So the Proverbs 31 woman was not a doormat.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.060]   But you have these extremes.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.240]   So counseling scenarios, this is just practical.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.460]   I'm not gonna go to Matt for this
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:06.340]   in terms of defending the biblical exegesis of this.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.980]   But I think it was helpful for me to think through,
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:11.260]   and hopefully it's helpful for you as well.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:14.500]   First, so you have that spectrum as well
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:18.260]   in the middle between dominant and doormat.
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:21.520]   So first scenario is what do you have
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.800]   when you have a husband who's a tyrant
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.840]   married to a wife who is dominant?
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:33.380]   What do you have there?
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:37.260]   Well, you can, I mean, you can imagine.
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.980]   You've got a whole lot of conflict
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.740]   in that type of scenario.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:47.740]   So I just put, kaboom, you've got some explosiveness there.
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:53.340]   If not harnessed by the Spirit of God,
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:57.100]   if not brought under biblical submission,
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.640]   you're gonna have a lot of conflict
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.480]   in that type of situation.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:06.520]   What do you have in the second scenario
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.080]   where you have a passive husband
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:13.080]   married to a wife who is a doormat or servile?
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:19.320]   You have a marriage that's not really going anywhere
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:24.220]   and a marriage in need of the husband
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:27.260]   to take biblical initiative.
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:33.260]   And then you can look at the different scenarios here.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.220]   You have a husband who's a tyrant
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:38.760]   married to a wife who's a doormat.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:43.060]   So he's calling the shots.
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:45.760]   And then you've got this other scenario here,
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.660]   a wife who's dominant married to a husband who's passive.
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:49.760]   Remember, this is a spectrum,
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.860]   so we see everything that's in between.
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.660]   Now, so the question is, I mean,
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:57.180]   those are just some counseling scenarios
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.780]   that you might come across.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.460]   And the question would be,
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:03.220]   how does a biblical understanding of complementarianism
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:07.060]   address these counseling scenarios?
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.740]   Well, the standard is Christ.
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:12.900]   I mean, in the end, the standard is Christ.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:14.940]   Both a husband who's a tyrant
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.700]   and a husband who is passive
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:18.660]   need to become more like Christ.
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:21.460]   Both a wife who is dominant
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:26.460]   and a wife who is a doormat need to become like Christ.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:31.240]   And when you have a husband who becomes more like Christ,
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:34.060]   what you see is that the husband
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:37.220]   is neither a tyrant nor passive,
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:39.940]   but develops a loving servant leadership.
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:44.500]   He leads, but it is a Christ-like leadership.
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:48.540]   It is a leadership that exercises self and love.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.740]   It is a leadership that gives up its rights
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.740]   and its privileges on behalf of his wife.
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.820]   It's a love that nourishes and cherishes.
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.740]   First Peter three, verse seven,
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:05.960]   which is my most frequently used verse
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.660]   when I counsel husbands,
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:11.840]   I live with your wife in an understanding way.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:16.940]   I should use that verse more than I use Ephesians five,
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:20.000]   because men, I think that's really practically
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:20.840]   where they're at.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.940]   They don't know how to understand their wives.
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:27.120]   They don't know how to listen to their wives
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:31.260]   and minister in a way that shows understanding.
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:34.240]   And most wives don't want their husbands
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.420]   to fix all the problems.
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:38.740]   They just want their husband to live with them
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.660]   in an understanding way.
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.480]   And that's what first Peter three, seven calls for.
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.700]   So you have a husband who becomes more like Christ
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:50.280]   and he develops this loving servant leadership.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:56.020]   And then you have a wife who is not dominant
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:58.260]   and who is not a doormat,
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:02.780]   but who exercises an intelligent, joyful submission.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.340]   Again, the standard is Christ.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.220]   Christ was not a doormat.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:11.880]   Christ was strength under control.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.820]   It was strength that was submitted to his father
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:22.020]   in joyful submission.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:26.700]   And you have a husband and wife moving
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.500]   toward this middle ground in both cases.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:34.320]   Now, in that case, when you have a loving servant leadership
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.660]   combined with intelligent, joyful submission,
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.700]   you have a biblical marriage.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:44.660]   You have both husband and wife living
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:48.380]   according to their God-given roles.
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:53.380]   And you have this beautiful complimentary relationship
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:01:00.180]   that respects each other as full equals
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:05.060]   in terms of dignity and worth,
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.980]   and yet playing different roles.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:11.180]   You have Christ likeness on both sides,
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.140]   one exercising a Christ-like sacrificial love,
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:18.500]   the other exercising a Christ-like submission.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:23.500]   And you have a wonderful expression
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.940]   of the fruit of the spirit,
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:28.580]   both by husband and by the wife.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.300]   Practically speaking, what this means for me
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.440]   when I counsel with married couples,
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:42.100]   rarely do I go to roles as the first order business.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:47.100]   So if the husband is walking in the flesh
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:51.620]   and the wife is walking in the flesh,
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.100]   and they're both being selfish,
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.860]   and they're both not being filled with the spirit,
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.820]   they're both not forgiving each other
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:59.500]   or respecting each other.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.660]   And I just come in, in my first counseling session,
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.980]   I say to the husband, "Well, you need to lead."
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.180]   And I say to the wife, "You need to submit."
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.040]   I'm not gonna get anywhere with that couple.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.540]   And both are gonna take, first of all,
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.460]   they're gonna listen to what I'm telling the other person,
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.500]   because the husband is gonna say, "Yeah,
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.420]   so you need to submit."
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.620]   And the wife's gonna say to the husband,
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.920]   "Yeah, you need to lead."
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.560]   And they're both just gonna exercise that
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.460]   in a fleshly, selfish way.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.700]   So rarely do I go to that as a first order business.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:39.380]   I really don't get into roles until I see forgiveness
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.700]   starting to flow between husband and wife,
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.120]   until I start to see the fruit of the spirit,
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.420]   a merciful, gracious attitude toward each other.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:51.300]   It's as you're working on those general ideas
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.460]   of just submission to the word, submission to the Lord,
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.140]   of being humble toward one another,
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.040]   and you start to see those things to grow,
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.940]   then you can introduce a distinction of roles,
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.500]   because now they're going to embrace that in a godly way.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.620]   But be careful of,
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.560]   I think that's a caricature of biblical counseling,
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.540]   is the husband and wife comes in for biblical counseling,
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.900]   and we just tell the husband to lead
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:17.980]   and the wife to submit.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.540]   Rarely does that yield good fruit.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.900]   So those are some counseling scenarios to think through
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.060]   in relation to the subject.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.640]   I hope that's helpful for your study.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:32.580]   Okay, what I'm gonna do is, I'm out of time,
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:34.380]   so I'm going to pray for us,
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.940]   and you can be free to leave.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.360]   Thank you again for joining us this time.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.740]   I'll hang around for five, 10 minutes.
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:40.620]   If you have any questions,
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:44.380]   I'll be happy to answer that according to the essays
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:47.340]   or anything else that I could help with.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.900]   But thank you again for joining us,
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:53.700]   and we're just blessed by your faithful study.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.160]   I pray that this is a help to you,
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.660]   and that you'll continue to grow
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.460]   in the knowledge of God's word.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.980]   So let me pray for us.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   Father, we do pray this for our churches
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.580]   and for our families, for our marriages.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.060]   We just do pray that,
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:12.620]   Father, you would fill us with the fruit of your spirit,
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:16.580]   and that the roles that you have assigned
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:21.360]   in the family and in the church would not be a burden,
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.120]   would not be exercised in a fleshly manner
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.040]   or a selfish manner,
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.540]   but Lord, that there would be the true fruit of Christ
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.380]   in each of our lives.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.120]   Lord, none of us can study these things
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.000]   without being convicted ourselves.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.160]   Father, we need to change.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.640]   Lord, I think of the authorities
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.960]   that you have placed over me,
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.380]   and just, Lord, how many times my submission
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:56.320]   is not a heartfelt submission, a joyful submission,
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.180]   but is a grudging, complaining type of submission.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.540]   And Lord, I believe that's true of all of us,
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:10.400]   that we need to grow in our submission to you,
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.560]   our submission to your word.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.740]   And Lord, as we grow in those graces,
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:20.740]   that we can call others to submit in their spheres of roles
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:24.580]   and where you have placed them,
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.220]   for we are models of that ourselves.
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:30.100]   So I just pray that that would be the fruit of our study.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.660]   I pray that you would help my brothers and sisters
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:37.660]   to continue to work hard and to read,
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.780]   to think, to write, to clarify in their own mind
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.140]   what they believe.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:47.320]   Just pray that you would bless this study
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.860]   and bring much fruit from this time
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.140]   that would abound to your glory.
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.140]   We thank you again and pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.380]   - All right, amen.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:58.300]   God bless you all.
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.240]   Thanks for being here.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.300]   If you have any questions, feel free to use the chat
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.740]   and I'll try my best to answer them.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:10.740]   Otherwise, we will see you next Sunday at five o'clock.
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:12.520]   So God bless you guys.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:17.520]   and I'll try my best to answer them.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:33.580]   - Yes, so we had a question that came in.
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.560]   Practically, what kind of homework would you give
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.300]   a married couple that is not following their roles?
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:42.660]   Should marriage counseling be counseled by a married couple?
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.080]   Great question.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:49.620]   I think my general approach has been
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:55.420]   to get through the principles of peacemaking
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.100]   before I get into roles.
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:02.680]   So I would go from Robert Jones' "Pursuing Peace,"
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.380]   which talks about the principles of peacemaking
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:11.520]   before I went to "Strengthening Your Marriage" by Wayne Mack.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.340]   Probably in a marriage counseling situation,
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:17.940]   that would be the order I would follow.
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:24.140]   I've just seen that happen where once you get into roles
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.540]   and you haven't dealt with those issues of the heart,
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:31.540]   of humility and forgiveness and loving one another,
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.680]   then, I mean, you've heard it.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.740]   It's actually true that people go to marriage seminars
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:44.820]   and where the roles of husband and wife are preached
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.920]   and the wife takes really good notes
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.140]   of what the husband should be doing
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:49.540]   and the husband takes really good notes
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.720]   of what the wife should be doing.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.720]   And now they've just got more ammo to judge each other.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.440]   And so you really wanna deal with those heart issues,
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.700]   the general heart issues of just humility, forgiveness,
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:07.180]   servanthood, and then if those things are in place,
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:10.420]   then I think "Strengthening Your Marriage" by Wayne Mack
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:15.020]   is a great introduction to roles.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.360]   He's got a great chapter on the husband's responsibilities
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.620]   and the wife's responsibilities.
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:25.620]   And then Stuart Scott's "The Exemplary Husband,"
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:30.940]   as well as Martha Peace's "The Excellent Wife."
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.960]   I would give those in bite-sized pieces.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.900]   I think that's a lot to, you know,
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:39.960]   you could really overwhelm a counselee
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.180]   if you assign the entire thing, but, you know,
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:45.240]   bite-sized pieces, I'll use the chapter
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.580]   from Stuart Scott's book.
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:50.820]   He has one chapter on 1 Peter 3, 7,
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.260]   living with your wife in an understanding way.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:54.700]   And I'll just assign that chapter
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.020]   and really just hit that issue
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:59.660]   because I find that that's a very common issue
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.500]   is husbands have a hard time listening to their wives
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.960]   and really understanding them.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.740]   And so there's listening to fix the problem
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.140]   and then listening to understand.
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:15.380]   And most of us husbands try to listen to fix the problem
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:20.380]   instead of listening to understand our wife's perspective.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:23.880]   So those are some of the homework.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:28.620]   I never counsel anyone in marriage counseling
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.380]   where I'm not convicted myself
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.580]   of things that I need to grow and change in.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:35.820]   So those are, that's kind of the joy
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:39.060]   and also the double-edged sword of biblical counseling
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.640]   is you give out God's word
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.780]   and you're also convicted yourself.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.280]   So great question.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.540]   Another question came in.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:51.760]   How do you help them counsel to see growth in other areas
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.360]   before they focus on leading and submitting roles?
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.980]   Yeah, great question.
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.380]   I mean, the first, practically speaking,
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:02.340]   the first thing is forgiveness.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.300]   I mean, you have to have forgiveness
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.100]   in a marriage counseling situation.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:12.100]   Forgiveness because what that does
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:16.720]   is it gives the husband and wife space to change.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.620]   If you don't have forgiveness
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:22.900]   and they're not taught in the principles of forgiveness,
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.660]   unconditional forgiveness,
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:27.740]   heartfelt forgiveness that's not dependent
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.020]   upon the other person's repentance,
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.700]   as well as conditional forgiveness,
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:38.700]   forgiveness that reconciles when the other person repents,
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:45.780]   then you're not gonna have space in the relationship
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.200]   to really grow and change.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.940]   And so the first thing is forgiveness.
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:54.360]   And then the second thing I would go to is humility.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.020]   Stuart Scott has a great chapter in his book,
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:02.620]   "The Exemplary Husband" on pride and humility.
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:04.860]   And then he's got this checklist of,
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:08.540]   I think it's 50 or something like that,
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.380]   50 ways to know that you're proud
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.060]   and the 50 ways to know that you're humble
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:12.980]   and you're supposed to go through it
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.440]   and you're supposed to evaluate yourself.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.320]   And then if you're really humble,
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.220]   you have your wife evaluate you on those issues.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.180]   I don't know how you get through that questionnaire
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:25.180]   without just being convicted of your sin.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:29.980]   I always give that to guys and just warn them,
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:32.800]   beware, conviction is coming.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.300]   But if you have forgiveness and humility in place,
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:42.300]   and then you've got some gracious attitudes,
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.220]   I think in Bible believing churches like ours
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.820]   that hold to a high view of scripture,
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.380]   you can have a lot of couples who hear these things
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.840]   in a legalistic way.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:57.780]   And they really harshly judge their spouses
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:02.880]   for failing to meet these standards.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:05.960]   And so Dave Harvey's book,
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.060]   I think it's called, "What Did You Expect?"
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.140]   He's got a book on marriage.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.860]   The name is escaping me right now,
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.900]   but I think it's, "What Did You Expect?"
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.740]   No, that's Paul Tripp's book.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.540]   Anyway, Dave Harvey has another book,
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:21.980]   "Married to Another Sinner" or something like that.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:26.880]   But that's a book that really we use in counseling
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.180]   just to, yes, "When Sinners Say I Do."
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:30.220]   Excellent, thank you.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:34.380]   He's got an excellent, that's a book we use
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.360]   when we see that legalistic attitude
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.740]   that's really harshly judging the other spouse.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:44.420]   Our counselors will use "When Sinners Say I Do"
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:49.060]   because he gets more into the issues of grace
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:54.060]   and mercy and kindness in the relationship.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.880]   Doesn't talk about roles too much.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.260]   I mean, I don't think he talks about roles at all,
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:01.700]   if I remember it correctly,
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:04.740]   but he really gets after those legalistic,
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.940]   prideful attitudes.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.020]   And we just found that if those legalistic,
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.100]   prideful attitudes in marriage exist
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.860]   and you go straight to roles,
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:16.720]   you're pouring fuel on the fire.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.540]   They just got more ammo now to judge
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.820]   and criticize each other.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.340]   So you gotta get after humility, grace,
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.020]   kindness, forgiveness.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:26.580]   Those are all just general things.
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.900]   And then when you see that, you can grow,
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:32.140]   you can teach roles on top.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.660]   And that's a general approach.
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.460]   You think through that on your own.
[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:37.840]   That was a general approach taught to me
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.620]   by Robert Jones at Southern Seminary.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:44.300]   I've thought through that and put that into practice
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:49.300]   and found that that's helped change my marital counseling.
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:53.420]   I think in the early days in marital counseling,
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:57.620]   I would go straight to roles and you need to submit
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:59.380]   and you need to lead.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.860]   And really a lot of it backfired
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.260]   and I was wondering why.
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:07.020]   I think 'cause, oh, you gotta actually help people
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:10.180]   be like Jesus and be humble before you do that.
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.500]   So, great question.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.860]   Another question came in.
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.740]   There's a lot of needed teaching on roles
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.060]   during premarital counseling.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:20.860]   What resource do you use for premarital counseling?
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:27.500]   Yeah, each of our pastors do premarital counseling.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:30.180]   We do it a little bit differently.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:33.340]   Wayne Mac's "Strengthening Your Marriage"
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:36.220]   is one of my go-tos on marital counseling
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:41.220]   just 'cause it really hits a number of those issues.
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:46.220]   I think that John Piper's "A Momentary Marriage"
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:51.860]   is a very good resource just that it highlights
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:53.480]   the one flesh relationship,
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.400]   the permanence of the one flesh relationship.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.700]   I think that's really necessary for premarital.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:00.540]   I think most people are not thinking
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.940]   of their marital covenant too seriously
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.620]   and he just has a way of sobering you up
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.380]   of this is the reality of what it is.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:10.860]   And those are some resources.
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:13.620]   And then "Pursuing Peace," I give that to everyone
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:16.860]   who's getting married and I just let 'em know
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.820]   whether you think you need this or not,
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:22.740]   you're gonna thank me later 'cause that's a great resource
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.380]   on just conflict resolution.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:28.460]   Those are three good works that I would go to
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:33.460]   and then just talking through those issues.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.460]   Wayne Mack's book is a little,
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:37.940]   the homework there is a little much
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:39.860]   but if a couple can get through it
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:43.220]   then I think they'll be ready to get married, so.
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:47.980]   Wonderful, great questions.
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:50.660]   So hope this helped.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:53.180]   "Book titles and authors."
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.620]   Yes, I will do that.
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:55.460]   Excellent.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.300]   Okay.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.740]   Well, hey, God bless you guys.
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:04.460]   Thank you so much for your faithfulness.
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:07.540]   We're encouraged at your study and your faithfulness.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:08.980]   Hope you have a great week.
