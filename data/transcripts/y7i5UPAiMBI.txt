[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   Well, after you write a book and the book gets published,
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.080]   what follows is a season of travel.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.000]   You get asked to speak at churches
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.240]   and speak at conferences on the topic of your new book.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.460]   That's generally how it works.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.080]   And I wrote a little book on life inside our media culture.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.040]   It's called "Competing Spectacles" is the title.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.500]   And once that book was out,
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.800]   I got asked to speak on the topic,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.240]   to explain what it means to live out the Christian life
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.640]   inside this age of viral video, addictive gaming,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.220]   blockbuster movies, and endless feeds of new social media.
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.560]   And as I labor to summarize my main points
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.320]   into one message, I returned over and over again
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.960]   to what has now become for me the most important verse
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.960]   in the whole Bible on why we have attention.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.160]   Why did God make us to focus on things?
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.140]   Why do we have an appetite for media?
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320]   Why are we the only creatures who can be glued
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.620]   to a screen all day long?
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.540]   The answer is in Hebrews 2, 1,
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.240]   a verse that follows right after Hebrews chapter one,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.920]   an entire chapter full of the supremacy of Christ.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.340]   And following that chapter on Christ's supremacy
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.000]   comes the first verse of chapter two, which says this,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.840]   "Therefore," so in light of all the crisis for us
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.840]   in chapter one, "Therefore, we must pay much closer
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.300]   "attention to what we have heard,
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.620]   "lest we drift away from it."
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.280]   It's an incredibly relevant and important text
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.560]   for us inside the attention economy, as it's now called.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.520]   Well, my friend Dan here at Desiring God
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.840]   was listening through the John Piper Sermon Archive,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.760]   and he recently sent me Pastor John's sermon
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.200]   on Hebrews chapter two, verse one,
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.660]   a sermon I had not heard before until recently,
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.640]   and lo and behold, in his sermon,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.200]   he connects Hebrews 2, 1 to our media diets.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.840]   Here now is Pastor John.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.300]   - It's a remarkable thing to me that in chapter one
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.160]   of Hebrews, there's no command to us.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.820]   We are not told to do anything in chapter one.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.120]   Chapter one is all celebration,
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.800]   all declaration to this effect.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.640]   In former times, God spoke in a lot of different ways
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.600]   through the prophets.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   Now, in these latter days, he has spoken to us by a son,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.720]   and then the rest of the chapter is to describe the son.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.280]   He's the heir of all things.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.480]   He upholds the universe with the word of his power.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.880]   He created all things.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.600]   He's the radiance of God's glory.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.440]   He's the exact representation of the father's nature.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.560]   He made purifications for sin.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.160]   He sat down at the right hand of the majesty.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.720]   He is over all angels, dispatching them
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.920]   to do his bidding among the saints.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.600]   He is worshiped by everything in the universe
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.400]   except his father.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.600]   He is God.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.480]   That's chapter one.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.480]   No commandments, no duties, just truth.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.560]   Just glorious, Christ-exalting revelation
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.520]   of God's final decisive word, Jesus Christ.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.800]   You remember a couple of weeks ago when I called it
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.960]   the final decisive word because it says,
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.120]   in these last days, he has spoken to us by a son,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.960]   and that the reason it's the last days
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   is because there's no third chapter of revelation.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.640]   You got an Old Testament period of revelation,
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.260]   then you've got Christ in the last days,
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.840]   and then eternity in glory.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.320]   There's no third era by which God does a new thing
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.520]   besides Jesus in speaking to the world.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.560]   It does not mean that subsequent to Jesus,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.680]   God can't communicate with us.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.100]   It means all of his communication flows from Jesus,
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.160]   points to Jesus, is measured and proved by Jesus,
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.420]   orients around Jesus.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.120]   Jesus is God's decisive word to the world.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.400]   It's the last word that he has to say.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.160]   Do you see the logical connecting link between chapter one,
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   the revelation of God's decisive final word in Jesus,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.080]   and the first commandment of the book,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.840]   verse one of chapter two,
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.760]   we must more closely listen to,
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.520]   or take heed to, or attend to what we have heard.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.880]   And the logical link is for this reason.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.600]   All of chapter one is designed to buttress
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.960]   the first commandment of chapter two, namely listen.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.260]   Everything he said about Jesus in chapter one
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.120]   was meant to say, "Wake up, listen, listen.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.760]   "Don't drift, listen.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.480]   "Take heed, look, zero in."
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.360]   That's why that little connecting phrase,
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.080]   and if you have an NIV, your little therefore,
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.160]   five words into the sentence or so, says the same thing.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.720]   Therefore, that is because of all that you've seen
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.800]   in chapter one, for this reason,
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.740]   or therefore, we must pay closer attention
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.600]   to what we have heard.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.020]   So if you boil down all of chapter one,
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.520]   and the first verse of chapter two
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.720]   into one simple sentence, it goes like this.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   Since God has spoken in these last days by a son,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   therefore, we must give close heed to what we've heard.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:26.400]   The dignity, the majesty, the glory of the word spoken,
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   Jesus, increases the sense of seriousness of the command.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.720]   Listen to him, listen to what he has said.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.600]   Now, it may seem strange to you, I don't know,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.880]   where you are in your listening to Jesus,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.640]   that so much weight would be put on the simple command,
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.920]   give heed to Jesus, listen to Jesus.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.920]   Pay close attention to what you've heard
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.640]   in this final decisive word that God spoke in Jesus.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.720]   But it isn't surprising to me,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.600]   because I know my bent not to listen.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.320]   Let me ask you this, what are you listening to?
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.520]   Everybody's listening.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.220]   Even deaf people listen to something.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.380]   Everybody's listening.
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.920]   If you wanna listen to a music group, you make provisions.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.060]   You have a tape deck in the car, and you have a tape.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.920]   If you wanna listen to the news, you make provisions.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.040]   You have a radio in the kitchen,
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.760]   or you make sure the TV is on
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.360]   at the right time in the evening.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.300]   You make provisions, you take steps,
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.120]   so you can listen to what you want to listen to.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.120]   If you wanna listen to the latest tale told by John Grisham,
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.500]   think of this, 'cause I walked into the Gatwick Airport
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   in London, and in the London Airport bookstore,
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.400]   there's walls of John Grisham novels,
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.960]   with big signs that says,
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.000]   "The most popular author in the world."
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.640]   So I saw every other person had Rainmaker,
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.240]   and on the plane it looked like.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.080]   If you wanna listen, if you wanna listen,
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.080]   you buy, you move, you get, you position yourself,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.400]   you take steps, you make provisions,
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.480]   so that you can listen if you wanna listen.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.960]   And everybody's listening to something,
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.360]   and I'm asking you, what are you listening to?
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.880]   If you wanna listen to a missionary,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.600]   who's in a hard place, like Liberia,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   or Sierra Leone, or Zaire, or Congo,
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.440]   you buy a computer and get on email,
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.160]   you download a couple times a day
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.520]   to make sure you don't miss it
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.440]   more than a couple hours worth.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.000]   You take steps, if you wanna listen,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.120]   you take steps and you listen,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.680]   and everybody's listening,
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.280]   and I'm asking, what are you listening to?
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.600]   What are you listening to?
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.760]   The first commandment,
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.680]   the first commandment in the book of Hebrews is listen.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.600]   Listen, please listen to Jesus.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.280]   Don't drift away.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.520]   Don't turn the radio up so loud.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.840]   Don't turn the TV on so long.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.400]   Don't read the novel so consistently
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.960]   that you don't tune in over and over and over
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.360]   to see and consider and hear Jesus.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.600]   That's what he's pleading,
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.280]   and that's what I'm pleading this morning.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.320]   The whole first chapter is written without any command
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.600]   in order to make the command light and easy.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.760]   This is not hard, folks.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.440]   Listening is easy.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.000]   That's why we do it all day long.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.640]   It's easy.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.080]   Having the radio off in the car
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.760]   is harder than having it on.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.200]   Test yourself.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.080]   Listening is easy.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.480]   God is not a meanie.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.760]   God spent 14 verses
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.480]   describing the spectacular superiority
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.040]   of his final word, Jesus Christ,
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.960]   over all angels and all television and all radio
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.840]   and all novels and all business and all commerce
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.520]   and all leisure and all education
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.040]   and everything in the universe
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.760]   so that when we get to this easy command,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.400]   it would feel easy.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.120]   Only one thing makes it hard,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.400]   if you don't wanna listen.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.960]   - Having the radio off in the car
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.400]   is harder than having it on.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.160]   There's a need for silence for sure,
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.960]   a relevant point for the digital age
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.040]   drawn from Hebrews 2.1
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.760]   in a clip taken from Pastor John's sermon
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.800]   on April 28th, 1996,

[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.360]   Well, speaking of a culture as pop media,
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.200]   the Apostle Paul was opposed
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.320]   to the cultural myths of his day.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.480]   So in light of what Paul said against ancient mythology,
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.120]   how do we view our current cultural myths today?
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.360]   Are captivating novels and superhero movies
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.280]   and long running TV series,
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.400]   does Paul's concern apply to the fictional media
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.680]   of our culture today or not?
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.480]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.320]   We will find out on Friday.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.280]   We'll see you then.
