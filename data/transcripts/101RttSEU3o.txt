[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   For once I find it very difficult to give you any particular text or any one verse as
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.940]   the text because I'm anxious this evening that we should consider together what the
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.760]   Bible has to tell us about the way in which God instructed the children of Israel through
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:31.320]   their leader Moses to build a tabernacle in which he would meet with them and in which
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.820]   they could worship him. We read at the beginning a section out of the 24th chapter of the book
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.480]   of Exodus beginning at the 12th verse which read like this, "And the Lord said unto Moses,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.560]   Come up unto me into the mount, and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.400]   a law, and commandments which I have written, that thou mayest teach them. And Moses went
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.520]   up, you remember, and was there in the mount with God for forty days and forty nights.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.960]   And during that time God not only gave Moses the commandments on the tables of stone, but
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:22.680]   he also gave him detailed instructions as to how this tabernacle should be built and
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.320]   how it should be furnished and what they should do with it and in it.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.320]   Now I'm calling your attention to this as a part of a general consideration which has
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.560]   been occupying us now for a number of Sunday evenings. I believe I'm right in saying that
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.360]   this is the tenth Sunday evening when we are considering the same general theme, the general
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.800]   theme being the message of the Bible to men. Now I believe that certain sections of the
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:07.480]   church, the Christian church, are observing today what they call Bible Sunday. I must
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.040]   confess that to me that's rather a ludicrous term, as if there is only one Sunday which
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.760]   is Bible Sunday. Every Sunday is Bible Sunday, at least as far as I'm concerned, and every
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.120]   Sunday ought to be Bible Sunday. There is no meaning in the Christian church at all
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.240]   apart from the Bible. The business of preaching is to let this word speak, to expound it,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.640]   to explicate it, to hold forth its message. I believe that what they have in mind in particular
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.680]   is that it's a day on which people are concerned and should be concerned about the propagation
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.680]   of the message of the Bible, the printing of the Bible, and the distribution of the
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.280]   Bible, because there are millions of people in the world who have never seen a Bible and
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.240]   who have never read a Bible. And it does behoove all of us to do all we can to circulate the
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.940]   Bible therefore, and to help in every way possible by material gifts and prayers and
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.800]   every other way to see that these masses of people who hitherto have never read the word
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.840]   of God should be in a position to do so. But you see there's something much more important
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.920]   than that. It isn't enough even to have a Bible. There are many people who have Bibles
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.720]   in this country but who've never read it. The mere possession of the book is nothing.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.000]   It can be quite valueless. Indeed it isn't enough even to read the Bible. We must understand
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.880]   the Bible. You remember the famous question which Philip the Evangelist put to that Ethiopian
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.080]   eunuch who was going down from a great festival at Jerusalem and was sitting there in his
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.920]   chariot reading a portion of the prophecy of Isaiah. Philip joined him and said, "Understandest
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.000]   thou what thou readest?" And the poor man had to admit and confess that he didn't. And
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.440]   Philip explained it to him. That's preaching. Preaching is the explanation of what the Bible
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.920]   says. Well now then, we are doing it, I say, with this big idea and object in our minds.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.400]   That the idea has become current that the Bible has got nothing to say today. That there
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.040]   may have been times in the past when the Bible and its message were useful and of value.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.920]   But people today dismiss it. Of course, an old book like that, how can it have anything
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.040]   to say to us at the present time? Well now, our whole series of discourses is just to
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:54.400]   show how utterly ignorant such a view is. To show how the Bible is the most up-to-date
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.560]   and contemporary book in the world. Indeed, to go further. And to show and to prove that
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:10.900]   nothing but the Bible really does speak to men's condition as it is at this very moment.
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.760]   Because the Bible is the most practical book in the world. It's not a book of poetry or
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.600]   a book of literature which you can pick up or not. It's not a book of fancy and of fantasy.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.400]   It's a history book. It is a history of men and women living in this world and what happened
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.320]   to them. But it's more than that, of course. It is the history of mankind written from
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:43.800]   the standpoint of God. In other words, the Bible is concerned simply about life, about
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.960]   you and myself, and what's happening to us in this world, and what we can do about it.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:59.080]   Well now then, its fundamental proposition is this. That things are as they are in this
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:08.680]   world simply because men and women will not listen to the voice of God. That's the whole
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:15.520]   message of the Bible. It starts a way back in the Garden of Eden. So we spent a number
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.440]   of Sunday nights in the third chapter of Genesis. Isn't this the whole cause of the trouble?
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.720]   God was speaking to men and as long as men listened and obeyed, he was living in a state
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:34.240]   of paradise. Ah yes, but the devil came and said, "Hath God said?" He raised a query
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.760]   as to what God had said, as to whether it was right, whether it was true, whether it
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.680]   was the best thing for men, whether it was beneficial for men. And from the moment men
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.720]   accepted that question and began to think that the word of God was not for the best,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:58.680]   from that moment men fell and chaos entered into the world. God, you see, punished men
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.920]   for his rebellion, for his arrogance. And men was turned out of the garden, and he's
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.800]   been out of it ever since. He was told he'd have to earn his bread by the sweat of his
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:18.240]   brow, that there would be enmity between him and the seed of the serpent, and that his
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:25.160]   life would be involved in troubles and trials, thorns and thistles and briars and diseases
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.760]   would come in, not only that, men would quarrel amongst themselves and so on. And the whole
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.400]   history of the world has been just that ever since. But man is very slow to believe this,
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.840]   he's very reluctant to accept it. He's always convinced that he can put things right,
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.080]   and we've been praising how he did so. We went to the time before the flood, which had
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.520]   become so terrible and appalling that God had to come down and destroy the ancient world.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.040]   Then he gives them another start. But instead of walking in the light of God's counsel and
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.360]   knowledge, you remember, they set themselves up and they said, "Let us build us a city,
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:10.920]   let us make ourselves a great name, and build a tower up to heaven." And God came down
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:17.440]   and again punished them, he scattered them, confused their language, and there they are
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:25.080]   scattered over the whole world with divisions. But then you remember we saw that God did
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:32.320]   something active. He took that man Abram and told him he was going to turn him into a nation.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   And we see in Abram the other type of life which is possible. The rebellious life always
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.840]   leads to trouble. Well now God sets up a man and says, "Look at this man. Here is a man,
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:50.720]   Abram, the friend of God, the greatest gentleman of all times. Look at him." And we discovered
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.040]   that his secret was that he always listened to God. He obeyed God. God called him out
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.800]   and said, "Come out from that land where you've been brought up and go into a land which I
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:09.480]   shall show thee." And Abram, we are told in that majestic phrase, went out, not knowing
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.200]   whether he went. But he went because it was God who had called him to go. And that was
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:25.760]   the whole secret of his life. Abram believed God. And he was justified and he was blessed
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.040]   of God. Well, but you remember we have seen that then this nation that came out of the
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:38.800]   loins of Abram, as it were, God said to them, "Now you are my own special people. I've made
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:45.760]   you for myself. You are my people." But he said to them, "If you are to enjoy the life
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.640]   that I would have you enjoy, if you are to be blessed of me, well then you've got to
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:58.240]   keep my rules. You've got to keep my commandments." So that last Sunday evening we were considering
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.680]   the message of the twentieth chapter of this book of Exodus, the ten commandments, the
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:11.800]   moral law which was given by God to his own peculiar people. God said to them, "If you
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:19.520]   keep those, I'll bless you." They said they would keep them, that they could keep them.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:28.040]   That was just another manifestation of the human pride of men's fatal self-confidence,
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:35.040]   because they failed completely to keep them. God, you see, thus constantly is returning
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.600]   to men and he addresses men and all along he keeps on saying the same thing, "This is
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:48.560]   the way, walk in it. This is the way to peace and blessing and happiness. Walk in it. Do
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:54.360]   this and I will bless you." And man is always confident that he can do it, but he is always
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.640]   failing to do it. That's the summary of biblical history. That is the summary indeed of the
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:10.400]   whole of human history. But thank God that isn't the whole story, that isn't the end,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.640]   because you see all that just leaves us in a state of condemnation.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:21.320]   The law was added, says the apostle Paul, because of transgressions. What the law could
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:27.840]   not do in that it was weak through the flesh. The giving of the Ten Commandments didn't
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.920]   save the children of Israel, it was never meant to. It was given to them in order that
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:38.720]   they might see their sinfulness, that they might discover their weakness and their inability,
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:47.000]   that they might realize how terrible sin is, the exceeding sinfulness of sin. That's why
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.200]   the law was given. So if we are merely left with the law, I say we are condemned, we are
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:12:01.960]   doomed, and we are conscious of our failure. But thank God there's another note. Thank
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.320]   God when God called Moses up onto this mountain, he not only said unto him, "I'm going to
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:13.520]   give you the tables of the law," he said, "I want you to go down and build a tabernacle."
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:20.240]   Thank God for the tabernacle. It's the second element in biblical history. The word of God,
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:27.960]   the command of God, the law of God. Man's failure, but then the promise of God.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.160]   And already, of course, we've been seeing it every Sunday night. We saw, didn't we,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:39.000]   a way back in the Garden of Eden that when men had rebelled and had fallen in sin and
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.360]   was in misery, hiding himself behind the trees and afraid of the voice of God, God came down
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:54.480]   to him and said, "Here's a promise. The seed of the woman shall bruise that serpent's head."
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:01.960]   The promise of salvation, even in the Garden of Eden. And we have seen how God has continued
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:08.120]   to do this. When he destroyed the world, he saved the eight people in the ark. When he
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:16.920]   scatters the nation, he forms his new nation. Ever, I say, God, when he thus condemns, also
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:24.120]   holds out a promise. And it is that very thing that we have here in this matter that we are
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:33.560]   considering tonight. God called Moses up onto the mountain, I say, and he gave him great
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:40.360]   instructions with regard to the building of a tabernacle, and later on similar instructions
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.960]   with regard to the building of a temple. Now, anybody who's ever read the Old Testament at all
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:54.520]   must have discovered that in this Old Testament, and indeed in the New, there is a great deal of
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:00.160]   reference to this tabernacle. Have you ever read through the book of Exodus? Have you ever read
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   through the book of Leviticus? Have you read these ancient books, and have you been puzzled as to
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:13.240]   what all this is about, about these different chambers in this tabernacle, and these different
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:22.560]   veils and curtains, and these altars that had to be built, and the tables and bread put on tables,
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:30.520]   and lamps and candles and lights, and an ark of the covenant, and cherubim and mercy seat,
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:37.520]   and so on, and all the details about the high priest and the priest, and about burnt offerings
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.560]   and sacrifice and meal offerings, and so on? And have you said, "How utterly boring! What has all
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.560]   this got to do with me? I'm not interested in it all." And you've turned over, and you've gone to
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:53.720]   the Psalms, or rushed to the New Testament. Have you done that? Have you felt that all this about
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:15:00.160]   the tabernacle and the temple has got nothing to say to you? Well, my dear friend, if you have,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:07.760]   you've missed something which is very wonderful and very glorious. This is God speaking still,
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:15.280]   and speaking in love, and speaking in mercy, and speaking in redemption. That's why all this
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:22.320]   detail is given. That's why you get the references to it in the New Testament. What is the tabernacle?
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:28.880]   The tabernacle is nothing but a great and a glorious prophecy concerning the coming of the
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:35.680]   Son of God into this world. It was a picture of all that in those dim distant centuries,
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:42.240]   fourteen hundred years before he came. It was God speaking, God promising deliverance,
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:51.200]   God assuring the people that the Savior, the Messiah, was going to come. And therefore,
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.480]   it is of vital importance that we should understand something of the great and vital
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:06.920]   message of the tabernacle, the temple, if you like, of God. Now, fortunately again for us,
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:14.320]   if we find it almost impossible to understand what we are reading in these Old Testament books,
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:21.280]   we can turn to the New Testament, and it's all put very plainly before us. You've seen it already
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.960]   in the reading in the epistle to the Hebrews, in those chapters eight and nine, and you'll find it
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.360]   elsewhere. There you're given the spiritual meaning, a key to the understanding of all
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:40.600]   this massive detail. Very well, then, let me just extract the big principles this evening.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:49.720]   All along in these discourses we've been concerned about the big principles. There are great details
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:55.400]   here, and we could spend months and years probably working through it all. All I'm concerned to do
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:01.680]   is this. We are going on until Christmas. We are working up to the reminder of that great and
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.840]   climactic event. And all I'm anxious to do is that God has been leading up to this throughout
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:14.280]   the centuries. That from the moment men fell, God came in and said, "That's your trouble. It's
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:22.080]   because you've done that, and you'll never deliver yourself, but I'll deliver you." And what can be
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:27.840]   more interesting and fascinating than to notice the ways in which God has done that? Well, now,
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:36.520]   let's see what he's saying here. What is God speaking to us through this tabernacle? Well,
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:45.920]   isn't it clear and obvious that the first thing he says is this, that he wants to come, and does
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:59.120]   indeed come, to dwell with men. That's the meaning of the tabernacle. In that holiest of all in the
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:09.800]   tabernacle, God's presence dwelt. Oh, read up the details for yourselves. There in that holiest of
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:16.080]   all into which the high priest alone was allowed to enter only once a year, not without blood,
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:27.240]   was the Shekinah glory. The glory of God dwelt between the cherubims on the mercy seat. In other
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:35.720]   words, God's presence. Now that is the ultimate object of the tabernacle, God coming down, as it
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:42.480]   were, amongst his people. Well, this of course is the whole heart of the gospel. It's the essence
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:53.800]   of the Christian message, that God, in spite of us, in spite of our rebellion and our folly and
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:19:02.760]   our sin and our failure, has not turned his back upon us. Here he is, you see, he's just given the
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.120]   law to the children of Israel, and they have said in their blindness and ignorance, "We will keep
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:18.760]   it." And then I say the miserable failure. But God doesn't forsake them, God doesn't turn his
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:27.680]   back upon them. God says to Moses, "I'm going to come down to dwell amongst these people." God says
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.960]   in effect, "The only way whereby these people can live a happy and a harmonious life is that I should
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:39.360]   be amongst them, and that they should dwell with me and I with them, and that they should commune
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:49.240]   with me and be in touch with me." Man's life in this world is doomed to be misery unless he is
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:57.280]   blessed of God. That's our fundamental proposition all along. And my dear friends, doesn't the modern
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:07.800]   world prove this? The world now, and especially during this century, has been trying to live
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:16.040]   without God. It's turned its back upon him. It's ridiculed him and all the teaching concerning him.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:21.520]   Men were absolutely convinced, they're still trying to persuade themselves, that they can
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:28.360]   live a happy life without God altogether. And are they not proving themselves tonight,
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:44.040]   that the whole thing is utterly impossible? Has the still sad music of humanity been ever
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:51.840]   more distinct than it is this evening? Don't you hear the groaning? Stop for a minute in the rush
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:59.080]   and the hubbub of London. Put your newspapers down for a second and just stand still and listen. And
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:11.280]   you hear the groaning of the human race. Look behind the paint and the powder, which can be
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:18.520]   put on so easily. Look behind it and see the haggard, drawn face. Take away the drugs and
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:26.040]   the stimulants. See the exhaustion, the tiredness, the weariness. Suddenly stop all the pleasure
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:33.520]   seeking and look at the boredom and the wretchedness and the unhappiness of men and women.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:40.120]   That's what it is. It always has been. It always will be. Men cannot be happy without God. He's
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.280]   been trying it throughout the centuries. But it's always failed. And it's still failing. It doesn't
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.600]   matter how sophisticated we are. It doesn't matter how advanced and developed we may be. It doesn't
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:59.000]   matter how perfectly we've developed our scientific inventions. Man cannot be happy without God. He
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:14.280]   was made for God. And his heart is restless until it finds its rest in God. And this is the marvel
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.400]   and the wonder of it all. The thing that ought to break us down and make us weep for joy at this
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:30.000]   moment. That though in our folly we've all done that. God, I say, comes down amongst us. Comes
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:38.320]   to seek us. Comes to dwell amongst us. He did it in the tabernacle. They didn't deserve it. They
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:44.480]   deserved everything else. They failed him constantly. But he always comes down. There they
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.040]   were, as slaves in Egypt. Had they been left to themselves, they would never have come out. They
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.760]   would have been destroyed completely. You remember the scheme of Pharaoh and his people? How every
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.840]   child born to a Hebrew was to be killed at birth, and so on and so forth. And there they would have
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:06.440]   been destroyed. But God came down and chose Moses and brought them out mightily. It's always God
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:13.200]   delivering them. And even after he's delivered them and they've spurned the vice divine and have
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:19.240]   failed to keep his commandments, he says again, "I'll come down and dwell amongst you. I'll come
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:28.800]   into the tabernacle. My presence shall be with you and shall go with you." Oh, this is the God
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.920]   whom I'm privileged to preach to you. The God whose heart is eternal love. The God of mercy
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:40.760]   and of compassion and of great kindness. We preach again as we do on Sunday mornings,
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:50.880]   the exceeding riches of the grace of God. That comes to men who deserves nothing but punishment
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:24:01.360]   and retribution and blasting. And comes and offers his very self to him. That's the great message of
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:09.400]   the tabernacle. You see, the tabernacle as a whole represents and is a prophecy of the Lord
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:17.320]   Jesus Christ. So that when the Apostle John, you remember, comes to write his gospel, he puts it
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:31.000]   like this in his prologue. "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us," which means and tabernacled,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:43.040]   among us. The same idea, you see, the tabernacle. He tabernacled among us in the flesh according to
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:51.080]   the seed of David, the seed of Abraham also. Here then I say is the first great message. God,
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:58.080]   the infinite, eternal, absolute God, who dwelleth in a life that no man can approach unto,
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:09.160]   whom no man hath seen at any time, the holy, eternal God, because of his pity and his mercy
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:19.640]   and his compassion, even comes down into the world and amongst men in order to deliver them.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:26.640]   That's the message of Christianity. When men could do nothing, when all was sin and shame,
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:34.040]   a second Adam to the fight and to the rescue came. That's the whole message. God coming down,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:40.960]   God himself coming down in the person of the Son, the second person in the blessed holy Trinity.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.080]   Nothing less than that. The Shekinah glory was an adumbration, a suggestion, a prophecy,
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:53.160]   but it's actually happened. That's the message. So that you and I tonight, you see, are not left
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:59.920]   simply to ourselves. We are living in a world in which the statesmen are failing. We are living in
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.520]   a world in which the philosophers have become almost ludicrous because they don't know where
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:09.320]   they are, and all their strange prophecies have been falsified. We are living in a world in which
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.400]   the poets and the musicians, and none of them are helping us. They don't know where they are.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:21.400]   They're like men groping in the dark at noonday. But thank God, here is a message which comes and
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:31.520]   tells us that though man is defeated and hopeless and helpless, God himself comes down and lives in
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:38.760]   this world, takes unto him human nature, shares the life of common humanity, lives with the very
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:45.920]   rebels who have turned their backs upon him in order to rescue them and to redeem them. The Son
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:55.360]   of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost. All right, there's the first great message
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:03.040]   of the tabernacle, but come, there's another great message here. God in the tabernacle and
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:14.520]   in the teaching concerning it is not only telling us of his coming to dwell amongst men. Fortunately
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   for us, he goes on to give us the second thing which is absolutely essential. In the tabernacle,
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:30.400]   he teaches us also as to how we can get into touch with him. If you were suffering from some terrible
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:39.200]   and horrible disease which was quite incurable, and for which all the physicians and the surgeons
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:46.240]   in this country could do nothing, and if you suddenly heard that a man in some other country
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:53.240]   had discovered the cure, and that this wonderful man was going to pay a visit to this country,
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:59.200]   do you know what you'd do at once? You'd say, "Now what can I do in order to get at that man?
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.920]   How can I be introduced to him? How can I make my way to him? Is there somebody who knows him?
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.280]   What are the channels that I must follow? I must see him. I must get into touch with him." Isn't
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:19.200]   it? Of course. It's exactly the same here. God comes down to dwell with men, to bless and to
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.400]   deliver. Ah, then the thing I want to know is this. How can I get into touch with him? How can
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.680]   I speak to him? How can I have communion with him? How can I go with my broken heart to him? How can
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.760]   I take my petitions to him? How can I take my burdens and leave them with him? How can I find
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.400]   him? I believe he's there. How do I get in? There he is in the holiest of all, with a brightness and
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:47.240]   a glory that alarm me and terrify me because I'm sinful. How can I get in? That's the question.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:56.440]   And in the teaching concerning the tabernacle, God answers the question. What is the teaching?
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.480]   Well, I'll divide it up into two sections. First of all, general, second particular.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:17.080]   By the general I mean this. God lays it down at once, and beyond any doubt or question,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:29.760]   that he has got to be approached in the way that he lays down, in the way, if you like,
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:41.040]   in which he dictates. Let me prove my case to you. Take these chapters of this book of Exodus,
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:49.080]   from chapter 24 to the end, chapter 40. Then go on to the book of Numbers, and go on to the book
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:57.080]   of Leviticus. Have you ever read them all? Have you gone through? Or have you given up in despair?
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:06.080]   All the details, all the most extraordinary details about how the tabernacle was to be
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:13.240]   built, its measurements down to the smallest detail, the various type of wood that was to
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:20.080]   be used, the gold and the silver, all these things, the colors, some purple, some red,
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.800]   and so on. And you say, "What on earth is the point of all this? What's this got to do with me?"
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:30.720]   And here are all these details. You can't get away from them. You've got to go on. Every single
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:37.680]   detail, almost every hook and eye, as it were, every slot and everything that fits into it,
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.960]   it's all here, down to the smallest detail with nothing omitted. And then when you've gone through
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:51.720]   all that, you find that God chooses a particular man to be high priest. And then he gives it all
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.840]   in detail as to how he is to be clothed, and what's to be done to him. And then the priests,
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.720]   and the ones who are to help the priests, and those who are to carry the ark, and to carry
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:10.880]   the tabernacle, all here in the minutest detail. And then you come on to all those offerings,
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:16.840]   burnt offerings, peace offerings, meal offerings, and the various sacrifices,
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:26.200]   and the festivals, and all these things, in the most amazing detail. And then you remember after
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.240]   God had said all this to Moses up on that mountain when he was there for the forty days and forty
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:37.720]   nights, as Moses was beginning to descend the mountain and to go back to the people, God,
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:43.040]   as it were, calls after him and says, "See that thou make all things according to the pattern
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:51.400]   shown unto thee on the mount." Not a detail was to be omitted, or to be missed, or to be trifled
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:58.120]   with, or to be modified. It was to be done exactly as God had dictated. Everything and every detail
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:08.000]   about the tabernacle itself, and the service of the tabernacle. What's it mean? I've already
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:22.960]   answered the question. God is to be approached in his way only. He announces that he's going
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.440]   to come down to dwell with men, where? In that holiest of all. Well, very well then,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.440]   some people say, we can all rush in whenever we like, and as we like, you try it and see
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:45.040]   what'll happen to you. Who can dwell with the burning fire? Who shall ascend into the hill
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:56.000]   of the Lord? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart. Isaiah had but a vision of him,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.800]   and he fell down, and he said, "Woe is unto me, for I am a man with unclean lips." These people
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:11.280]   of Israel, who merely saw the outskirts, as it were, the mere hem of the garment of God,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:17.960]   there blazing on top of the mount, they quaked with fear and trembling, and they said, "Speak
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:28.520]   you unto us, Moses. Don't let God speak. It's too terrible." And yet foolish people say that
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:38.040]   God can be approached quite easily, no difficulty at all. They say all this is unnecessary. They
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:43.560]   say if God's God, and if God is a God of love, as you say he is, well then surely all I've got to
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:47.600]   do is when I'm in trouble, I turn to God in prayer, and all will be well with me. But you've
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.880]   tried that, haven't you? And it doesn't work, does it? Of course it doesn't, and it never will.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:59.120]   People say if you want to find God, all you do is to sit on a comfortable chair and relax,
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:09.200]   and begin to listen, and he'll speak to you. The Bible doesn't say that. If it were just that,
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.920]   you know, you wouldn't need all these long chapters in Exodus and in Leviticus. It would
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.880]   be much simpler, wouldn't it? Indeed, you know, if you accept men's ideas about God,
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:22.240]   and how God is to be approached, you wouldn't need much of a Bible at all. It'd be so simple.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:29.480]   Let go, let God. Just watch to God, and all is well. No trouble at all. But there's all these,
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:35.040]   all these details, and the Son of God having to come down on Christmas Day, and a cross,
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:45.560]   and a grave, and a resurrection. What's it all about? It's just about this, that that holy and
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:53.360]   eternal God says that he's to be approached in his way, not in yours and mine. And he lays down
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:59.480]   the instructions in the minutest detail. There is only one way to God. It's the way that he himself
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:09.840]   has appointed. Bible Sunday. Yes, this is the message of the Bible on Bible Sunday. That God
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:23.600]   is only to be known if we approach him in the way that he himself has indicated. It is he who
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.720]   appoints the dimensions of the tabernacle, and all its fittings, and all its furniture,
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:36.120]   and all its ceremonial. He calls the high priest Aaron, nobody else. Certain men called Korah,
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:40.720]   Dathan, and Abiram, you'll find in the book of Numbers, they objected to this. They said,
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.920]   "Who are these men, Moses and Aaron, who say that they alone can approach God? They're no better
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.800]   than we are." And these three were very able men. They say, "We don't agree with this. We can go
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.240]   into the presence of God. We can take incense as well as Aaron." The rebellion of Korah. Do you
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.560]   remember what happened to them? They were all destroyed, and all who agreed with them simply
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:11.040]   vanished, were swallowed up by the earth. God punished them. But for a hundred years and more,
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:20.400]   modern men with all his cleverness and his ability has been criticizing the Bible. He's
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:26.800]   dismissed this Old Testament, especially this part of it. He's queried the need of atonement.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.720]   He's ridiculed miracles. He's made a new Bible, and it's so much smaller than this, isn't it?
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.480]   It's so convenient you can put it in your waistcoat pocket almost. He's eliminated things
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.120]   out of it. All this, he says, is unnecessary. It's all so simple. Live a good life and God
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:52.760]   will bless you. But God doesn't seem to be blessing us, does he? With our new God and our
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:59.040]   new Jesus, look at our world. We don't seem to know him, and we are certainly not being blessed
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:06.120]   by him. And my friends, we never will be until we come back to God's way. You know nothing about
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:13.600]   God tonight, and I know nothing about God except what I've got in this book. I have no other
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.520]   authority. I have no other sanction. I have nothing else that I can prove. I know nothing
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:25.240]   about God except what God has been pleased to reveal concerning himself, and I have that in
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:33.960]   this book. And I come to it on bended knee. I come to it as a little child. I, in my ignorance,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:42.560]   know nothing. I want it to tell me, and it tells me. That's why he dictated all the details. It is
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:49.280]   the only way whereby men can come unto God. There is none other name under heaven given amongst men
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:56.760]   whereby we must be saved. This is the only way. Very well, there it is in general. What is it
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:03.840]   in detail? Let me just summarize it. Here are the particulars. Oh, I'm not going to take you
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.320]   through all the details of the tabernacle. There's no need to, but I must start at the beginning,
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:15.040]   mustn't I? As you entered into that tabernacle, do you know the first thing you met? You met an
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:25.440]   altar, which is called the altar of burnt offering, or the brazen altar, an altar of brass. And on
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:33.040]   this, animals were to be sacrificed, and the blood was to be kept and collected. The brazen altar,
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:42.480]   the altar of sacrifice. What's it mean? At the very entrance. Oh, it's just God's way of saying
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:50.720]   that if we really want to know him and to get into his presence, we must start by realizing that we
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:39:01.080]   are sinners. That sin is a terrible reality, and that that holy God cannot play fast and loose
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:09.000]   with sin. My friend, you will never arrive at God and never know him until you start by facing the
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:19.040]   fact of sin, that you are a sinner. The Apostle Paul realized this, you see, because he reminded
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.720]   the elders of the church at Ephesus when he said farewell to them, that when he had been amongst
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:31.040]   them, he preached two things. First, the repentance that is toward God. Secondly, the faith that is
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:37.520]   toward the Lord Jesus Christ. He started with repentance, and you and I must. Of course,
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.680]   we don't like this today. We want Jesus as a friend or as a helper. We want some kind of
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:47.240]   psychological treatment. We want somebody who will deliver us out of our troubles. My dear friend,
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:58.200]   before that happens to you, you've got to realize that you're a sinner. Repentance must come first.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:07.360]   You can't get into the holiest of all without passing the brazen altar. Animals must be
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:14.400]   sacrificed, sin must be put on them, and they must be killed, their bodies dealt with, and the blood
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:22.880]   taken. The brazen altar, the condemnation of sin, the condemnation of the sinner, man in sin has got
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:30.640]   to realize that he's a fool, he's under the wrath of God, and that he's lost unless atonement is
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:41.920]   made for him. That's at the very beginning. Have you sometimes wondered why your prayers are not
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:52.080]   answered? I wonder whether the explanation is this, that you simply rushed into the presence
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:59.080]   of God to ask him to help you in your need, without confessing your sins and acknowledging
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:07.360]   that you only were able to speak to him because of the blood of Jesus Christ. Have you known that
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.040]   moment of anguish when a loved one was desperately ill, and down you went on your knees, you hadn't
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:17.480]   prayed for years. You prayed, and you said, "God didn't answer me. I don't believe in your God.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.960]   He's not a God of love, or he wouldn't have left me." But my dear friend, you are not approaching
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:29.920]   him in the right way. You and I, all of us in sin, need to be taught how God is to be approached,
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:37.320]   and you must go past the brazen altar, the altar of sacrifice, the place where sin is exposed and
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:44.120]   condemned. You cannot get in without going past that. You must start there, and then having done
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:50.120]   that, you go on, you see you need cleansing. And the next thing you meet in this tabernacle is a
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:56.440]   lever, a sort of bowl with pure water in it, in which the priests had to wash their hands and
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:08.320]   cleanse themselves. Oh, the need of cleansing! For God is holy and pure, and there is no kind
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:15.480]   of compromise possible between purity and impurity, and holiness and sin, and light and darkness.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:22.040]   Whosoever enters into the presence of God, as I've said, needs clean hands and a pure heart.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:28.920]   I not only need my sins forgiven, I need a new nature, I need a holy nature, I need to be
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:35.000]   sanctified. And the lever of water reminds me of that. It's there in the old tabernacle,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.120]   and it's still equally true, and God provides it. This is the way to be cleansed, this word.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:48.520]   The Lord Jesus Christ prayed for his own at the end, and he said, "Father, sanctify them through
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:43:00.120]   thy truth. Thy word is truth." Here we find how to be sanctified, to be clean, to be made pure,
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:05.840]   to be fit to be in the presence of God. And when you feel you're unclean, it makes you clean.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:16.040]   And what else do we need? Well, we need strength and power. We need light and help and unction,
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:22.280]   and it's there for us. God gave Moses instructions how to build a most wonderful lamp, with oil
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:28.040]   flowing into it perpetually, the picture of the Holy Spirit, and then a table with certain loaves
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:35.000]   upon it. What's that? The life we receive from Christ, the food for the soul, the sustenance,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.920]   the thing that builds us up and makes us powerful to go into the presence of God. The light,
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:51.800]   the life, the strength, the unction, the ability, the power. And what else? Well,
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:44:00.480]   we are still with a veil in front of us, and we know that God's presence, that shekinah glory,
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:07.160]   is the other side of that veil. How can we get in there? All the priests were allowed so far,
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:18.280]   but there only one is allowed. The high priest only is allowed in there that but once a year,
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:26.280]   not without blood. He went in once a year bearing blood with him to offer for the sins of the
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:33.640]   people, and there he took it to the mercy seat, and God said he was satisfied, atonement was made,
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:39.320]   and the high priest went out announcing that the very fact that he was still alive and came out
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:44.680]   from the presence of God was proof in and of itself that God had pardoned and forgiven,
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:54.560]   and their sins were all covered. And you and I are conscious of the need of this, are we not?
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:04.920]   How can I venture into the presence of God? I feel small, I feel so finite. I am sinful,
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:11.040]   I am unworthy. I need some spokesman, I need someone to take my prayers and send them on.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:22.960]   I need a holy incense. I need someone who can stand before God on my behalf. I've reminded
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:28.880]   you already that God chose the high priest, not men. He chose Aaron and nobody else,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:39.040]   and he has chosen again an infinitely greater. Seeing therefore, says the author of the epistle
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:45.200]   to the Hebrews, that we have a great high priest that has passed through the heavens,
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:53.520]   Jesus, the Son of God. Let us hold fast the confession and more, let us draw near unto
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:46:01.560]   the throne of grace. I'm not left alone, there is a great high priest representing me. He's
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:07.080]   entered in bearing what? Not the blood of bulls and of goats, or the ashes of an heifer,
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:19.840]   but his own blood. That's the Christian message, that into this world of sin and shame and failure
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:27.680]   and degradation, God has sent his own Son. Why? In order to make it possible for you and for me
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:38.880]   to enter into the presence of God. Christ has entered into the heavenly tabernacle, of which
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:45.800]   the earthly one was but a shadow, and he has purified the heavenly places with his own blood.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:52.640]   He has taken his blood to God's mercy seat, and God has there said he's satisfied. Do you remember
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.680]   what we had told about that mercy seat? It was this. There was an ark with the Ten Commandments
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:05.080]   inside it, and then gold over that, and then these cherubim, and then the presence of God.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:17.600]   He came and met men there. You see how? Over the Ten Commandments, God's love and God's
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:26.800]   forgiveness are absolutely just. God doesn't set aside his Ten Commandments. God demands
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:33.000]   that they should be fulfilled, and they have been fulfilled in Christ. So God says,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.960]   "I'll forgive you. I'll receive you. You've honored the law in my Son. The mercy seat is
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:49.800]   the place where law and grace meet together." God is satisfied by the life, by the death,
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:48:00.360]   by the resurrection, by the blood of Christ. And there in Christ, who is himself the mercy seat,
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:11.240]   the propitiatory, God can be met this evening. And as I said at the beginning, I say at the end,
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:24.320]   the one thing every man and woman in this world needs is to know God. If you know God and are
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:31.760]   admitted into God's presence, he will bless you. He's promised it. He's always done it. Read the
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:38.520]   lives of the saints of the Old Testament. Read the lives of the apostles. Read the lives of
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:44.000]   the saints in the church throughout the centuries, and you'll find that these men testify together
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:51.440]   that he does bless. He does hold you when you need him. He does give you health and strength
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:57.160]   and power, and if for some reason he decides to take them from you, he doesn't take his joy from
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:09.280]   you. He'll be with you. He'll never leave you nor forsake you. He will bless you. To know God is
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:22.040]   the supreme blessing. If you know God, you have everything. And God can be known, but he can only
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:35.800]   be known through Jesus Christ and him crucified. You are not asked to try the impossible. It's
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:39.880]   no use going out and saying, "I'm going to try to live a better life so that I may go into the
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:50.160]   presence of God." You'll never do it. Give it up now. It's hopeless. You've got nothing to do but
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:58.000]   to admit way back at the beginning at the brazen altar that it's your sin and your sin alone that
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:05.880]   stands between you and God and the blessing of God. Confess it, admit it, repent, acknowledge it,
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:11.040]   give up defending yourself. Say, "I deserve nothing but hell. I don't deserve the smile of
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:17.400]   God. I'm such a vile, unworthy creature. I have no claim upon him at all." Say that, admit it,
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:28.160]   cast yourself into your case unreservedly and utterly. Upon his dear son, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:37.040]   believe that he has taken the burden of your sins upon him, that he has died for them, shed his
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:43.760]   blood for them, has offered the blood to God who has accepted it, and that in him God forgives you
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:55.720]   none. All your sins forgiven, none. Blotted out as a thick cloud, God will receive you. God will
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:06.320]   smile upon you. You will know God and you will be blessed of God. And even in this terrifying world
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:20.680]   of 1955, you will know a piece of God that passeth all understanding. Thank God for the way he has
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:31.160]   spoken unto us through the tabernacle. Amen. We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching
