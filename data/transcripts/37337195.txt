[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.300]   Welcome, friends, to this episode of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.560]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey, and I'm excited to spend some time with you today as we encourage
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.120]   one another, learn together, and ponder the delights and challenges that make homeschooling
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.480]   the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.560]   Now, whether you're just considering this homeschooling possibility or deep into the
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.080]   daily delight of family learning, I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.660]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome, you'll find even more support in
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540]   a local CC community.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.820]   So go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you today.
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.200]   Well, listeners, you have a treat in store for you.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.680]   I want to introduce you to two friends of mine.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.040]   We've got Jenny Tran.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.020]   Jenny, welcome.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.380]   Hey, everybody.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.760]   And Jodi Priest.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.860]   Jodi, thank you so much for making time for us today.
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380]   My pleasure.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:18.060]   I am glad to have you guys because I want to speak to a truth that we all know deeply.
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.160]   Homeschooling is the adventure of a lifetime, and it's something new every day.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.300]   For every one of us, homeschooling turned out a little differently than we thought it was
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.020]   going to go.
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.180]   I sometimes look at my kids on a really hard day and think, I saw this going differently
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.240]   in my mind.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.800]   You know?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.220]   And when I started out, I had all these ideas of what a great teacher I was going
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.420]   to be and what perfect little students they were going to be and all the amazing things
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.000]   we would learn.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.880]   And the only thing that has been true is all the amazing things that we would learn.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.440]   Okay?
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.620]   And I was not perfect, and they were not perfect, but the Lord was still perfect, and He was
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.740]   perfect with us.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.620]   And I have invited you ladies here because you have a unique perspective on I saw this going
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.280]   differently.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.920]   And so I want us to introduce you and your family's homeschooling journey to my online
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.360]   friends today and let you be a blessing to them.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.620]   So I want people to get a feel for who you are and why you have something to tell us.
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:40.380]   I want to ask, how long have you been homeschooling and why did your family begin homeschooling?
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.940]   Now look, ladies, there's no right answer.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:51.880]   You don't get ejected or buzzed if you say something weird that is not homeschool perfect because we
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.960]   already established none of us are perfect.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.300]   So I want to really know, why did you homeschool from the very beginning?
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.360]   Jodi, I'm going to let you start off.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.800]   How long have you been homeschooling and why did your family begin this journey?
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.460]   We have been homeschooling, this is our 11th year.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.480]   We have never done anything other than CC.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.360]   We started CC when my oldest was four and he is now 15.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.540]   So why?
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.520]   I tell people why, because the Lord knew that we needed to homeschool before I knew that we
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.360]   needed to homeschool.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.760]   So when we started homeschooling, I have five children.
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:45.120]   We just had two and it was my two boys and we just felt like the Lord kind of put a homeschool
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.100]   family in our path with teenagers.
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.420]   Oh, yes.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.240]   And we were like, we don't know what they're doing different, but we want children.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.480]   I want some of that.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.380]   So we just kind of blindly jumped in.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.540]   We were like, well, we went to a CC informational and we said, well, that sounds good.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.540]   Um, and then we kind of wrestled with, uh, but our kids will never ride the school bus
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.600]   or they'll never learn to stand in line.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.400]   My girls.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.720]   Okay.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.280]   I found out that one of my children didn't want to homeschool anymore and I, I didn't freak
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.360]   out, but I asked more questions.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.660]   I discovered it's because she wanted a lunchbox.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.080]   Well, we wrestled through all of that and the rest is history.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.700]   Um, so 11 years and we homeschooled because really the Lord knew that that's what our family
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.600]   needed in years to come.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.860]   And yeah, you knew before you did.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.720]   That's really cool.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.960]   I think it's really cool that your family has done CC the whole time.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.760]   Our family began as homeschoolers, but I did not know about CC until my oldest.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.160]   Well, we didn't get involved.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.120]   I found out about it a year ahead of when we joined, but, um, my oldest was fifth grade.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.140]   And so she didn't have those early.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.700]   She didn't have as much foundations as her sister had.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.340]   So that's cool.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.920]   All right, Jenny, how about you?
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.860]   Um, how long have you homeschooled and why did you and David elect homeschooling as your
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.060]   education method?
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.900]   Yeah, well, we have, we just finished our sixth year of homeschooling because my oldest is only
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.340]   10.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.720]   So we started right from the get go and we've only done CC as well, uh, because David started
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.340]   working for CC when banks was three.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.760]   So it was right before he would start foundation.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.720]   So that's kind of that story.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.280]   But Judy, it's interesting.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.840]   Your story is a lot like my story.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.640]   David introduced me to a homeschooling family when we were dating and seeing how their family
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.860]   interacted with one another.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.280]   And just, I knew something was different about them.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.520]   I said, that's what I want.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.000]   And for some reason I, I just associated that with, oh, it's because they homeschool.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.760]   Isn't that fun?
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.220]   But that's kind of what introduced me.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:02.600]   But we really also enjoyed, or we loved the idea of the flexibility of schedule and David
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.960]   and I both love to travel and we knew we wanted to.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.840]   So knowing that we wouldn't have to take our kids out of school to go travel, that we weren't
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.700]   dictated by someone else's schedule for them really appealed to us as well.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.220]   And of course, we wanted to be in charge of training their hearts in the way that the
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.920]   Lord has.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.580]   And we didn't see that going well in any other school system.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.020]   So that's kind of why we decided.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.140]   Yeah.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.240]   I love that.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.220]   The whole idea of being really, truly able to shepherd and care for your child's heart as
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.280]   well as their mind.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.460]   Jodi, you mentioned that you guys chose homeschooling.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.560]   You really feel like it was because the Lord knew that you were going to need it before
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.100]   you did.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.260]   What did you mean by that?
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.600]   Well, when we started homeschooling, we just had our two boys and then we got pregnant with
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.460]   our third kiddo and she was diagnosed with trisomy 21, Down syndrome.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.080]   And that was during my pregnancy.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:13.080]   So the Cliff Notes story, since we don't have all the time in the world, is that homeschooling
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:19.840]   homeschooling really fit our family in those younger years when she had some medical issues
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.740]   in infancy.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:28.320]   It just gave us the flexibility to kind of focus on her, but still stay up with school.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:36.980]   And it allowed us to, she was diagnosed with leukemia when she was two.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.520]   And we were able to kind of pack up.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.420]   We left Moore County.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.780]   We're here in Southern Pines.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:52.260]   And we packed up our family and went to Cincinnati, where she received treatment in Cincinnati.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:59.580]   And the beautiful thing of the whole story is that we left our CC group here for a little
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.460]   while and kind of picked up with a CC group in Cincinnati.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:11.960]   So fast forward to today and she's fine and just homeschooling works for our family.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.340]   And the only thing I can say is that the Lord knew we were going to get Eden and he knew that
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.640]   this was the best match.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:26.620]   And so he just led me there before I even knew that it was going to be a thing.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.880]   What a beautiful thing that the Lord allowed you guys to establish your homeschool rhythm
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.020]   before Eden joined your homeschool rhythm.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.440]   And so you are already a little established.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:55.180]   Is homeschooling, I imagine that homeschooling is a great fit for her and blending her needs
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:01.360]   and her interest into the rhythm, the family rhythm of learning.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.680]   I mean, I cannot imagine anything else.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:14.340]   She is, she has now done CC since she was probably four or five as well.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.220]   I mean, she's excelling in all the things.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:27.940]   I just, I can't imagine anything else because I have the privilege and flexibility of tailoring
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.560]   her weekly work.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:36.820]   Um, I mean, to the point that last year, I started a new curriculum middle of the year for her reading.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.900]   Um, and so CC just provides that stable foundation.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.880]   And then all of the pieces, parts that I supplement with, I mean, it's kind of trial and error.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.540]   What works with her choices.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.840]   That's really cool.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.020]   That's really cool.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:58.020]   Um, Jenny, you said you have how many kids?
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.940]   I have five as well.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.620]   Five kids as well.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:07.300]   So does homeschooling work for all five of your kids and does it work for all five of them
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.840]   for the same reasons?
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.220]   Yeah, I think it definitely works for all five of them.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.760]   Um, and they all have their individual needs for sure.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.080]   Um, I just had my fifth.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.040]   So, I mean, technically he's still being homeschooled as well right now.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.620]   Right, right.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:30.160]   Just turned four months old, but I, I know that it's going to do well for him as well.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.820]   My oldest, um, he has a Tourette's syndrome.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.020]   It's a mild form of it, but we didn't know that actually until he was already homeschooling.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:44.700]   And it's been a real big blessing to have not only CC, but the flexibility at home to,
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.540]   first of all, get to know who he is and how he learns.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:57.120]   To change things on a daily basis for him, because I've found that as he's gotten older,
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.820]   his needs have definitely changed.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.840]   And what worked even six months ago is not going to work now.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.300]   And I'm able to have those conversations with him and what he needs.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.880]   Um, even if it's just, you know, an exercise break, or if he wants more freedom, uh, with,
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:19.060]   with his, uh, Tourette's diagnosis, he also, there's usually a secondary underlying
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:19.580]   condition.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.980]   So, um, we've got OCD on, on top of that.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.120]   Um, so it's been really nice for him.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:34.200]   Um, and then, um, also the one, the baby I just had little Callum, he also has a trisomy
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.260]   21 diagnosis and I did not find that out until he was born.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.000]   And Jody has been my saving grace.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.340]   I've asked her so many questions and I really look forward to being able to homeschool with
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.980]   him, uh, all throughout as well.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.120]   I'm learning a lot from Jody.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:57.220]   It's nice to have a big sister, you know, uh, it's nice to have somebody who has walked the
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.560]   path, even if it's just a little bit ahead of you.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:08.700]   Um, it gives you some, not just hope that the path is walkable, but it gives you community
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.820]   along the path.
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:15.760]   And I really did want to talk about, um, neurodivergence.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.580]   You know, there are a lot of families.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.660]   I spent lots of years on what I called the practicum circuit.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.760]   Like I went and talked to people in all different, um, states.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.520]   I did practicums everywhere.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:34.960]   And I always had parents who would come up and say, this sounds so, and they would have
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.120]   this longing in their eyes.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.740]   This sounds so wonderful.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:44.080]   I really want our family to be able to do this, but I have a special needs child.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.560]   It's what they used to say years and years ago.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.960]   And I'm not sure that this would be good for my student.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:58.620]   And then one year I had a student in my challenge B class who had Tourette's, um, and I had kids
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.880]   who were diagnosed with OCD.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:11.560]   And I was able to say after that, um, I believe that this is a great avenue for your family, but
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.820]   I wanted you guys to speak to it.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:24.000]   So for listeners who have tuned in and they're thinking, I'm not even sure what neurodivergence
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.920]   is, Jodi, would you give us a layman's label, a layman's term for that?
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.680]   I mean, I feel like, I mean, we can all look up in the dictionary.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.880]   What is neurodivergence?
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.180]   Exactly.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.340]   Everybody can use mother Google and Google that, right?
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.040]   In my conversations with families, I'm a challenge A tutor.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.380]   I've kind of been around a while.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:52.160]   Um, yeah, I always tell people when we used to use the word special needs and they would
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.860]   say, I have a special needs child.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:14:01.620]   Um, since having Eden, I always just push back and say, who doesn't have special needs?
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.400]   We all have special learning abilities.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:13.220]   Um, so just because they're, they have the label and you don't, we're all still,
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.880]   in the same pot of learning and we all learn differently.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:26.220]   Um, so if neurodivergent by definition is just a child that learns differently from what
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.620]   is typical, I guess.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.300]   Yes.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.180]   If we use five common topics, where do we land on what is typical?
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:40.760]   Um, what you can compare, compare to, you know, I mean, what most people are doing at a certain
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.920]   age, but yeah.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.580]   Wow.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:51.420]   I do feel like half of the battle of being a mom of a quote unquote special needs or neurodivergent
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.700]   child, half the battle is getting myself out of the way.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:04.680]   Um, I feel like I hold her back so much because in my mind, when I look at the CC curriculum,
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.300]   I say, well, I don't know that she'll ever be able to enter essentials.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.280]   I don't know that she'll be able to do this.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.420]   Um, but what, but I need to focus on what she can do.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:25.640]   And this year she was able to grasp the concept of a map and places she was able to, I mean,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.860]   she is just rocking presentations.
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.740]   Isn't that wonderful?
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.720]   So I mean,
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.840]   For any child to rock presentations, because I had one that was so shy.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.000]   She did not talk above a whisper for a long time.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.580]   So for any child to rock presentations, I'm like a fan.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.060]   I mean, do we always understand what she says?
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.600]   No, but the beauty is her classmates are translators now.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.960]   So they're getting something out of it.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:59.540]   I mean, it's just a beautiful, um, it's just a beautiful vision of what I feel like the Lord
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.360]   meant for community, um, that we see with her.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.560]   And, you know, so back to your question, what is neurodivergent?
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.220]   I mean, I, I really would love it if we just did away with it all together and said,
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.260]   you know, here's her learning style.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.780]   Here's your learning style.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:23.260]   This is how she processes what she hears and says, how she experiences the world, you know,
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.580]   um, she needs to experience the world more quietly.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:32.000]   I, one of my daughters, when she was really young, she could not deal with loud noises.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.100]   You know, she did not want to experience the world at high volume.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:42.940]   And I mean, that wasn't typical for a two year old, but it was the way she experienced the world.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.100]   And so we made adjustments.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.080]   I love the, what, that way of looking at that.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.540]   Um, what does this mean?
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.300]   What is this?
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:00.480]   Cause I understand that neurodivergence in and of itself is not a diagnosis.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:08.540]   It's a description of how children, um, process what they experience and how they experience
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.220]   the world.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:20.380]   Um, what does that array, whether it is down syndrome or Tourette's or OCD, um, what does having a
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.400]   child who is dealing with some of those challenges?
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.660]   What does that mean for education at your house, Jenny?
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.620]   Yeah, I'll be honest.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.560]   I, I mean, I don't do anything differently.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.060]   I mean, maybe it's just because it's what I know, uh, cause I look at each one of my children
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.200]   and I say, okay, what, what do you need banks and how do you learn best?
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.920]   Okay, Lila, how do you learn best?
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:51.320]   And, um, I, I take my children individually when I'm thinking about curriculum choices,
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.480]   um, outside of CC reading and things like that.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.460]   Um, how do I need to schedule their day?
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:04.820]   Um, I don't, I don't look at banks any different just because he has that label, I guess.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:10.840]   It's just what I do for all my children because I really want to, I want them to succeed and
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.280]   I want my house to be calm, honestly, too.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.960]   And it's what works best for us.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.240]   So it really, I don't, I don't see any different than what I talk to my friends.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.160]   It's not based on a label.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:27.280]   I, what I hear you saying is it's not so much based on a label as it is based on knowing your
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:34.420]   child and all of your children and what will be the most comfortable way for them to learn.
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:43.540]   You know, what, how can they most, um, happily and effectively take in information and how
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:51.260]   can you build a community that intersects the needs of all of your children and what, what
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.160]   will work label or not.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.060]   Right.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.020]   And it might mean I need to spend a little extra time with banks on certain things as well.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:05.840]   So I, I know that that's had a big adjustment in our year this year, uh, with banks entering
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.660]   essentials and he, his, his personality, you just got to love him.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:17.560]   Um, he likes things a particular way and he follows the rules that very type a type personality
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.560]   and he wants to get it all right, right away.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.040]   Yes.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.880]   Yes.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.580]   And he has to be right.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.940]   And it takes him a little bit longer just to understand certain things or why we have
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.940]   to do things a certain way.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.600]   Right.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.680]   Especially with all that essentials work.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.980]   So it was a trying year in that regard.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.240]   So I did have to spend a little bit of extra time with him.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:46.220]   Uh, but again, that's the beauty of homeschooling and the flexibility is I could let the girls kind
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:51.920]   of go do their thing more independently and I found curriculums that helped with that while
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.460]   I focused a little bit more on banks.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:59.040]   Um, I catered our day kind of around, I need to spend, you know, maybe an hour of essentials
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.840]   with banks cause it's going to take him that long to understand the concepts.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.760]   Um, right.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.900]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.620]   So we just constantly reevaluate as well.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:14.080]   Cause you know, one, what, what worked last fall did not work this spring, especially
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.100]   after having a baby.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.080]   So, um, yeah, constantly reevaluating.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.940]   Okay.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:25.980]   So that's, that is actually, that's the kind of nugget that I think our listeners are hanging
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:33.940]   on the edge of their seat waiting for, because we think we, you know, I'm a real type A make
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.580]   a list and make a plan.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:41.680]   And so I would make the plan in September fully believing that in April it would still work
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:48.320]   and then, you know, be confounded when my children did not see it that way, or, you know, life
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:48.880]   happened.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:55.000]   So to hear you say, okay, you got to get over yourself if you're that kind of planner and
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:02.480]   you just need to know that you're going to be, um, you are going to be riding the wave
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.180]   of your children's changing needs and be okay with that.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.040]   That's a great way to put it.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.840]   That's a lovely way.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.300]   So we all just need to become better surfers.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.620]   Okay.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.140]   I'm processing that.
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.440]   And that's probably my disorder that I have trouble with change.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.320]   Jodi, what about you?
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:30.540]   What does it mean for education in your home, um, to have Eden have some unique learning challenges
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.360]   or ways that she learns?
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.940]   Oh, goodness.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:41.380]   Uh, I mean, like Jenny, we definitely are, we just hold it with an open hand.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.160]   Like it worked last month.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.080]   Um, let's keep trying.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:51.900]   I mean, I threw a whole lot of things out the window in January of this year and started something
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.220]   new.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:56.100]   So, um, I'm always just kind of open to what works.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:01.360]   And I, I feel like with Down syndrome, you know, there's no one expert on how they learn
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.380]   because they are individual humans and they all learn differently.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:15.020]   Um, but I think the thing that having a different style learner in our house, um, from our typical,
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:21.240]   more independent learners, um, has just really caused us to slow down.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:28.020]   Um, it's just really, it's real easy now that we have some teenagers in the mix to just go,
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:28.880]   go, go, go, go.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:35.560]   Um, and our house, you, I, we can't, like Jenny said, sometimes I had to spend extra time with
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:35.920]   banks.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:41.420]   Sometimes we have to spend extra time, um, or change the day up.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:48.100]   Or, I mean, it's just kind of a, um, an anchor for us, um, which is kind of nice.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.760]   Have you ever wished that you could just help your student continue the momentum that they
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.920]   started in classical conversations in a college environment?
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.940]   Guess what?
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.180]   Judson College is exactly what you've been looking for.
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:06.300]   This semester, Judson College is sponsoring the Everyday Educator, and we are so excited to
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.800]   partner with them because we really believe that they have exactly what our students could
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.060]   need for the next leg of their education journey.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.680]   Let me tell you more about it.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.780]   So Judson College really values Christian education, and they exist to equip students who want to
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.400]   give their lives for the cause of Christ, wherever he might call them.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   So that means that they're not just helping students who want to go into vocational ministry,
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.300]   but also students who want to live in the marketplace.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.480]   Judson College also has a specific community plan for their students.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:43.540]   They have smaller class sizes that allow students to have individual relationships with the faculty,
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.960]   and that also helps them to get the attention that they need so that they can learn and grow
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.780]   as professionals.
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:54.040]   Outside of the classroom, they also have what they call the house system, and that provides
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:00.180]   a vibrant student-led community where students make lifelong friendships and participate in house
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:05.260]   competitions and experience deep community all the way from freshman year to graduation.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:11.780]   Lastly, something I found absolutely fascinating was that they have a classical emphasis.
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:17.420]   So they have a great books course, which is required for every single degree in undergrad.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:23.020]   And in that course, they focus on the history of human ideas through a biblical worldview,
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:29.880]   and that allows the students to develop as readers, writers, and researchers as they grow as committed
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.900]   followers of Christ.

[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.080]   Let's get back to the show.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:50.900]   It actually, I was going to say, it actually sounds lovely to say that we are going to pursue
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:59.000]   restful learning, or we sometimes need to change the atmosphere so that it's not frenetic,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:10.820]   that it's not go, go, go, go, go, get her done, probably doesn't really minister to many of us.
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.140]   We're just used to living that way.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:22.260]   So we might all benefit from a slower, easier pace, a more relational pace, a more tailored
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:27.340]   to our current needs and learning culture pace, a better rhythm.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.580]   And I can say, Jodi, that we found the same thing.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.180]   We have to slow down a lot.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.880]   And it was harder for me to slow down than it is for my kids, I think.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.340]   I think they need to do all the things and we have to be done by lunch or something.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.440]   And no, we don't.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.340]   Who says we have to be done by a certain time or we have to do a certain subject every day?
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.380]   We've done so many different things to change the day up.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.560]   We even one semester, maybe even just six weeks, I just did one subject a day, but we did it
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.920]   for like the whole week's worth.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.860]   And that worked for that season.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.780]   And then we had to move on from that.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:09.700]   But slowing down was a real big eye opener for me as well, because I didn't want to.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.340]   It was more me than them.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:16.560]   And I had to really humble myself in that to say, take a breath, Jenny.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.540]   They're okay.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.080]   They're right where they need to be.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.320]   Just because that kid's somewhere else, you can't compare what our family does to someone
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.240]   else's family.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.460]   And that was a big learning curve for me.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:37.160]   Yeah, it is very wise that there are sometimes lessons that we as parents have to learn before
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.340]   we're very good at shepherding the education of our children.
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:48.980]   I have so many things that I want to ask you guys, but know that I only have a little bit
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.260]   of time.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.520]   So maybe what I'll do is have you back another time and we will explore some other things.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:27:01.400]   I suspect that there are some parents, though, who would love to pick your brain.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:09.660]   So, Jodi, you said that you guys found out that Eden, when you were still pregnant, that
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.160]   Eden was going to be born with Down syndrome.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.420]   Jodi, you and Jenny, you didn't know until Collin was born.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:29.680]   What would you tell parents about seeking help when they become concerned about their child's
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.980]   development or about things not being typical?
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:48.720]   Well, my answer that I have developed by trial and error and that I hold fast to now is I
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.660]   don't seek help.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:28:02.200]   I have learned that the world is very quick to label these children or just give them a medicine
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:09.720]   medicine or, you know, it's a therapy or something to get over fill in the blank.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:17.500]   So really, I mean, this may sound just kind of rainbows and butterflies, but it's really just
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.320]   a matter of just seeking the Lord.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:28.260]   And the Lord has been faithful to dump things into my lap that have been life giving to her.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:38.460]   And for full transparency, we in last year in January adopted another little girl with
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:45.800]   Down syndrome from South America who does not speak any English and educating her.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:54.500]   I mean, I have no person to ask anything because it's such a unique story.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.320]   And really, the Lord has just been faithful to lead.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:04.940]   So really just seeking the Lord for that is all the advice I can give because I feel like
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.560]   before I was wise in this area, I would seek help.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:17.060]   And it just left me in a defeated place, just a defeated and overwhelmed place that didn't
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.800]   have the answers that helped.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:29.140]   I can imagine getting so many opinions and so many recommendations that at times were probably
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.280]   very divergent.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.700]   And so how do you choose?
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.380]   You don't.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.900]   Who's right?
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.900]   Who's right?
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:43.060]   So, Jenny, for you, you said that you guys didn't realize that banks had some of the processing
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.880]   issues right away.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:52.920]   So when what led you to think there may be something different that we need to address?
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:58.580]   How did you recognize that there were some things you might need to work around or work with?
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.280]   Well, we noticed some of his tics.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.440]   That's a symptom or something that children with Tourette's have.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.420]   He was moving his arms a certain way or making noises with his mouth.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.600]   And at first, he's a kid.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.460]   He's a kid.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.560]   But it started getting, I guess, kind of more consistent.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:24.060]   And I remember there was one day it took him like two and a half minutes to get one sentence
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.740]   out because he had to make certain movements with his head and noises with his mouth.
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:37.860]   And it was causing him not to be able to, what's the word I'm looking for, guys, to communicate
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:38.340]   with us.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.140]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.040]   And so I videoed him.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.880]   I asked him a question and I told him I was going to video him and send it to our pediatrician
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.520]   at the time.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.440]   And I just videoed and I said, what do you think?
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.420]   And she said, well, if you want to go see a neurologist, that's your choice.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.920]   He was very, our pediatrician at the time was very much, you know, you're the mom.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.920]   Right.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.740]   So I just decided to go.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.580]   Follow your cues.
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.740]   Because I knew I would not, I did not want to medicate him for anything.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.700]   I knew it wasn't that bad.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:15.160]   But I think for me, I just wanted to know, is this something I need to be aware of and
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.460]   that I can research on how I can help him better?
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:22.760]   Because I don't want this to hinder him as he starts school to be able to communicate
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.340]   with people.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.400]   Sure.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.160]   I mean, is there something that you could know that would help them?
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.940]   Not, is there something you could do about him?
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.880]   Is there something you could do for him?
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.300]   Right.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.260]   And that goes back to wanting to know my child.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:40.340]   And even when the neurologist just said, yes, he's got Tourette's.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.720]   And I said, well, what does that mean?
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.600]   How do you come to that label?
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:50.340]   And, you know, listening to her doing my own research, I came to know that, okay, yeah,
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.780]   we have a mild form of that.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.440]   It's, it's not what they portray on TV.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.620]   It looks a lot different.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:02.500]   And to keep my mind open about who he is, because I will be very honest, when he got that diagnosis,
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.900]   it was, you know, it hits you here as a mom, like, oh no, is he going to struggle?
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.820]   How am I going to parent him?
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.540]   The same thing when we found out that Callum has Down syndrome.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.900]   I, in the hospital, I was a wreck.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:21.280]   I just, not because he had that specific thing, but it was, God, am I really prepared for this?
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.100]   How am I going to parent?
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.560]   I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.260]   I already have four.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.800]   Like, are you, are you sure, me?
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:33.380]   Like, and that's what I actually texted Jodi as soon as I could get myself together.
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.020]   I said, Jodi, here's where we are.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.160]   I know you've been here before.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.520]   I need help.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:44.840]   So in that way, I did ask for lots of help, but I also, as I get the different opinions
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:52.180]   on Tourette's or Down syndrome, I take it as a grain of salt and I go to the Lord about it.
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.820]   And I say, okay, I know my child best.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.160]   What do you want me to do with that, God?
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:07.060]   And it's, it's been hard, but we've also seen the beauty in that the Lord provides what you need,
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.840]   even when you don't know what you need.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.200]   Kind of like what Jodi was saying earlier about she homeschooled and didn't realize how much it was
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.120]   going to, how much she needed it.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:21.700]   Man, while we were in the hospital with Callum, the Lord just showed me who he was in so many
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.440]   different ways.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:29.140]   Cause I felt I was the one that was scared and unsure, but God was like, I knew this was
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.940]   going to, you know, Callum was going to be your child from the get-go.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.940]   I know Banks was going to have this forever.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.140]   He, this is his personality.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.200]   This is the way he learns.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.700]   And you're just learning this and it's okay.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.660]   Cause I had this in my plan all along and it took a while.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:49.400]   I was not great those first few weeks, but I'm the kind of person that I like all the information,
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.960]   but I'm going to make my own decision when you give me that information.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:34:05.660]   I want you to talk just for a minute about the power of community, the power of community.
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:14.860]   Um, and not just for children who have special learning plans for all of us.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.280]   What does community look like for your family?
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:23.000]   And what are the blessings of community for all of our families?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.600]   So what do you think, Jodi?
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:35.640]   Oh man, that is, I feel like different seasons of life, community has looked different, but
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:41.080]   it's always been a vital backbone to our homeschool.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.640]   There was a season of life where community held us up.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:53.440]   Um, and thankfully we are celebrating because community now is a place where it's not necessarily
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.420]   holding us up.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.880]   It is, we're thriving, um, communities thriving.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:08.380]   It is, um, I was telling, I don't, I don't remember who I was telling, but I feel like if
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:13.540]   we, if you kind of flip around, like what community is doing for us and say, well, what is our family
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.720]   doing for community?
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:23.040]   Um, I feel like Eden and our new daughter, Emily, they're just presence in community.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.080]   community is just such a life-giving thing.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:30.460]   Um, we are not insulated in our comings and goings all week.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:40.000]   Um, and the children that they've kind of, the do community around, uh, they treat them differently
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.060]   than kids outside of our CC community.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:50.260]   Um, and it's just, it's just a really great thing because there's just a silent teaching
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:57.200]   that's happening, um, just to love people where they are, despite like any physical differences
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.520]   or, um, things like that.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:06.160]   So, Hey everybody, we want to interrupt the show to let you know that national memory master
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:14.240]   and national commencement are moving to the classical conversations, family cruise in 2026.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.540]   That's right.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.920]   This cruise isn't just about celebrating CC graduates and memory masters.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.700]   It's about all CC families.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:28.720]   You can connect with CC leaders and families at all stages in their journey and turn education
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:35.660]   into a memorable family adventure as you explore the Bahamas aboard Royal Caribbean's freedom
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.320]   of the seas.

[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.320]   Let's get back to the show.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.400]   We hope to see you there.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.280]   So what about you, Jenny?
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:55.420]   How has community been a blessing to you and to all your children, to your whole family?
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:37:02.440]   Yeah, uh, we love community and we have, you know, several different, I guess, types of community.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:07.680]   Um, but I'll just, I give like a lot of real life experiences.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.500]   Um, for instance, I agree with Jodi.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.960]   Communities can look different in different seasons of life, but that doesn't mean that's
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.040]   the only season that they can speak to you.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:24.800]   Um, after we had Callum in January and we found out about his diagnosis and, uh, we spent
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:30.120]   time in the NICU, um, and we were delivering an hour away from where we live.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:37.040]   And so, um, I of course got discharged, but I had to stay close by in Raleigh to Callum because
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.160]   he was still in the NICU and I was having to go back and forth.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.600]   Well, our community, we used to live in Raleigh.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.940]   We've been here in Whispering Pines now for five years, but.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.540]   Our church community from Raleigh was all around us.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:55.380]   We stayed with our old marriage mentors who were at, in our wedding, or I did.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.980]   David had to come home to be with the other four kids.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:03.020]   So our community here in Whispering Pines was taking care of David and my kids by bringing
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.240]   them meals, helping David with babysitting the kids while he worked.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:13.540]   Um, they were, you know, my friends were texting me and encouraging me and praying for me while
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:19.300]   I was in Raleigh, our old church in Raleigh was somehow, I had two nurses that went to
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   Summit, uh, our old church.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:25.240]   Um, I had a, a friend that I actually mentored her.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.040]   She came to visit me in the hospital.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:32.440]   Um, it, it was just really interesting to see how God took those two communities during
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.660]   that season and brought them together to help us.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:39.420]   And, you know, we hadn't been back to Raleigh really in five years, but all these people came
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.540]   out of the woodworks to say, let me bring you a Starbucks gift card.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.800]   Let me come get you lunch today.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:50.900]   Um, so it's just, I don't know where we would be without community, honestly.
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.340]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:59.240]   I love that people come out of the woodwork and there, there is no limit to the love that
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.720]   the Lord wants to show us.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:07.940]   And it is a beautiful thing when, when that love flows through his people and that we're
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.720]   able to minister to one another.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:16.740]   I love that, um, I appreciate you guys sharing your experience and your wisdom.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:24.120]   I feel like you have given us lots of things to think about and lots of wisdom, um, to build
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:33.000]   our home community on, um, no matter how many children we have, no matter what the learning
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.420]   needs or the processing abilities of our children are, you guys have given us some really great
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:46.300]   principles, uh, upon which to, to construct a good family learning community.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.240]   And I appreciate y'all being here today.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.560]   I want to give you one more chance.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:56.080]   I want you to tell me your family's favorite thing to do together.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:02.060]   What is it that your family loves to do all together?
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.920]   Cause maybe we all need a new idea for the summer.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.520]   Okay.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.160]   All right, Jenny, you're laughing like you have something in mind.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.140]   Tell us, what is it that you and David like to do with your kids all together?
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:18.680]   Oh, uh, I mean, we, we, we just love, we love upbeat music.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:23.960]   And so we love to sometimes just blast the music and have silly dance parties with them.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.020]   Oh, how fun.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.560]   Most of them love it.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:32.000]   I will say Banks does not, it's not the biggest dancer, but he participates in his own way.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.260]   And we had to learn to be okay with that.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.000]   Yes.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.520]   Yes.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:41.900]   But some, I found that sometimes when your house is just too, feels too serious or the
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.140]   joy, you feel the joy has just sunk away.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.120]   We just, all right, let's go dance it out.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.440]   Um, so that's, that's one thing we really love.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.240]   That's awesome.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.220]   Yeah.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.420]   Well, we also love to travel to new places together.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:57.060]   So we've been able to go with David on a lot of work trips, which has been fun.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.680]   Oh, that's so nice.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.220]   You mentioned you love to travel.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.120]   I think that's fun.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:06.180]   Well, um, I know some people who might pay big money to see a video of David dancing.
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.780]   So, uh, you can hook me up later.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.200]   Okay.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.540]   Um, Jodi, what about you?
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.080]   What does your family love to do all together?
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:19.960]   Oh, I, I think I would say we like to go camping.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:26.880]   Um, we are, we're campers and, um, I think our kids led the way on that.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.940]   And my husband and I kind of got on board like, well, I guess we'll enjoy this.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:36.000]   Um, but yeah, that's, I mean, we don't get to do it as much.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.140]   As we'd like anymore, but, um, but it's, yeah, it's a great thing.
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.980]   Something for everyone to love out there in the woods.
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.600]   Yes.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.340]   Yep.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:45.720]   Okay.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.880]   Well, that's a good thing.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.240]   All right.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.320]   Um, ladies, thank you so much.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.540]   I appreciate you sharing your homes and your families with us today.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.260]   Listeners.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.680]   I know you have been blessed.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:01.320]   You can let us know what a blessing this has been, um, by dropping us a line.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.600]   Um, thanks for joining us and we'll see you next time.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.820]   Bye-bye.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:05.820]   Bye-bye.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.720]   Bye-bye.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.560]   Bye-bye.
