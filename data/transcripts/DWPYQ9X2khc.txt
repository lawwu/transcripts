[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This great chapter for the fifth Sunday night in succession.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We've been looking at it and its all-important message,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   and we've been doing so for this reason.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   It seems to me to be a good thing from time to time
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   that we should deliberately stand back and take a large
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   and comprehensive view of the message of the Bible.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   There are so many today who seem to think that the message of the Bible
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   is remote from life and irrelevant,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   that it doesn't meet us where we are in the midst of our problems and our difficulties.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Well now I've been at pains to try to show that the exact opposite is the truth,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   and that there is no book in the world tonight that comes to us exactly where we are
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   and in our exact predicament as the Bible does,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   and in the particular way in which it does so.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   In other words, it seems to me that this third chapter of the book of Genesis
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   is absolutely essential to a true understanding of life as it is at this moment.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I'm speaking of the individual, I'm speaking of life as a whole.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Now we are all confronted by these problems, are we not?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We've got our own personal problems.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   No one is perfectly happy.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Things will go wrong. We all know what it is to be miserable.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   We all know what it is to have a sense of failure.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We all are seeking for something which we haven't got. Why is that?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   What's the explanation? That's the problem.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   It isn't some fiercely theoretical problem, it's just that.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Why these wars and tumults and uncertainties and disappointments?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   What is the matter? What is it all about?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Well, for me to summarize what I've been trying to say,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   there are only two possible answers to all those questions.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   We either accept the teaching of this book which we call the Bible,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   or else we don't.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And you see, I put all other answers into the one category.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   They are not the biblical answer.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And that's the important thing about them, that they're not the biblical answer.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Well now, here is the case as it is put before us here.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   The Bible, I say, is a message about life, about man, about his problems and his troubles.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's why you see, in addition to its teaching, it gives us history.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   It tells us about nations and what happened to them,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   about individuals and what took place in their lives.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It's the most practical book in the world.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And it tells us that it comes to us with a message from God about life itself,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   and about our lives in particular.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Now then, my suggestion has been that all that is put in this one chapter
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   here is the most important key to history that is available to men at this moment.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It explains the past, it explains the present, it explains the future.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I've been pointing out that this chapter is at one and the same time
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   a literal historical record of something that has actually happened.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Let me put it as plainly as this.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I have no gospel unless this is history.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   My gospel is based upon this history.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   This is not allegory, this is history.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   But in addition to that, it is in the most amazing way
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   an account and a description as we've seen of the very thing that happens to us one by one.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   For, this is the astounding thing.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Every one of us in turn repeats the action of Adam and Eve.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So we took it in different ways.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   We saw it first of all from the purely intellectual standpoint, those first verses.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   How the suggestion came and men began to doubt,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and then brought in his philosophy and began to reason.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   We've all done it, we're still doing it.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Then we began to consider some of the consequences of doing that.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   This consciousness of nakedness.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   This feeling that we'd lost something.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And the attempt to cover ourselves, which always fails, we went into that.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   The whole history of philosophy.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And then we went on beyond that to consider some further consequences.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And that was our theme last Sunday night.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Man thought at the beginning that he'd finished with God,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   that he could turn his back upon God and live an independent life.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And he took his action, but you remember,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   he suddenly heard the voice of the Lord God in the cool of the evening.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   He can't escape from God.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   He hears the voice and he runs behind the trees to hide himself,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   thinking and imagining that God would not be able to find him there.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   But God searches him out, he finds him exactly where he is,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and brings him right out and addresses him personally.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And our point was that God still does that.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   We've all been hiding behind these trees.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   The camouflage we put up.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   The problems we say that confront us.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   We'll argue about anything as long as we can keep the gospel message from ourselves.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   There are your trees.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I told you last Sunday evening that no doubt to many of us
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   it would have been much more interesting and entertaining
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   had I attempted to preach a sermon on the theme
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   that's having the headlines in the newspapers today.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But that I regarded that as one of the trees.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Because while I'd be giving my opinion about divorce,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   you who are not confronted by that particular problem
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   would be feeling very happy about yourself.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And your sin would not have been dealt with.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Well, I confess freely that a man who stands in a pulpit like this
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   is sorely and grievously tempted.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   This morning a representative of the Press Association waited upon me
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   before the service, wanting to know if I was going to consider the theme.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And my only reply was that I never find my sermons in the headlines of newspapers.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And that furthermore I was going to preach about something
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   that was of much greater concern to every reader of their newspaper,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   but which I am certain they would not print,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   because it wouldn't be sensational as they think.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   But if you're interested in sensationalism,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   this is to me the most sensational thing in the world at this moment.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   That every man born into this world is under the wrath of God.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And unless he believes in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   that wrath will abide upon him.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   But the newspapers are not interested in that.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That would involve them, the owners, the managers, the editors, everybody.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   We're always interested in somebody else,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   and some other problem remote from us.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   There are the trees, but the Gospel brings us out,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   and we've got to face God alone.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   "Adam, where art thou?"
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It's a personal question.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Well, very well, my friends, that is more or less the point at which we've arrived.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It all seems hopeless, doesn't it?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Man fell from his first estate.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   He was driven out of paradise, and there's the flaming sword
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   making it impossible for him to get back.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   His life is a life of toil.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   He's contending with thorns and thistles.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Children are brought forth in pain and suffering.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Death has come in.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   The world is in a state of chaos.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   That's the figure. That's the position.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   But thank God the history doesn't end at that point.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That isn't the end of the story.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And that's why we are here at all in this building at this moment,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and that's why I call myself a minister of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Into this hopelessness and wretchedness and despair
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   comes a pronouncement and a proclamation,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   a revelation of God and from God,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   revealing unto us his plan and his purpose.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And it is to that that I'm anxious to call your attention this evening,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   as it is put to us so perfectly and in such a gloriously succinct manner
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   in this fifteenth verse of this third chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Here is the first pronouncement and proclamation of the Christian gospel.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   "Made a way back in the garden of Eden."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   How utterly ignorant they are,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   who think that because we are Christians we don't need the Old Testament.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   It's a complete failure to understand the New Testament gospel.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   These things must go together, the old and the new. Why?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Well, it's the same God operating right through.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And there, a way back at the beginning,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   he makes this announcement, this proclamation.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Well, now let me try and summarize it by putting it to you like this.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   What is the message?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   What is the position confronting us? Well, it's this.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   The fact is, whether we like it or not,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   that the devil is controlling this world.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   That's where the history has brought us.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   "Men in his folly," as Eve puts it in reply to God,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   "the devil, the serpent, beguiled me."
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Having beguiled Adam and Eve in that way,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   the whole of humanity has been beguiled.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And the result of that action was that mankind has put itself
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   under the dominion and under the power and under the control of the devil.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Now, let's be perfectly clear about this.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I'm asserting that that is the only way to understand the history of the world.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I said at the beginning that we are concerned about contemporary history,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   about the state of mankind at this very moment,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   and about our own personal problems.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And I say the question is, why are things as they are?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   There is only one adequate answer.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It is the devil.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   We are under the control and the power of the devil.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   That's why things are as they are.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   That's why they have been as they have been.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   That's the whole explanation of history.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Man, left to himself, is absolutely hopeless and helpless in the hands of the devil.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Someone may say, "Oh, yes, but you're basing all that on the third chapter of Genesis,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   and of course I no longer accept that.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Science now knows that this can't be true, of course.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   This is really just allegory.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   It's romance.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   It's fantasy.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   It's fancy."
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Well, of course, the simple reply to that is this,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   that science has got nothing to do with it at all.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Science has got nothing to do with history.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Science is supposed to deal with facts,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   and when the scientist goes beyond that, he ceases to be a scientist,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   and he's trying to be a philosopher.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And he's simply expressing opinions which are of no more value
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   than the opinion of any man who's never had any scientific training at all.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   But, my dear friends, my point is that I am not basing it solely on the third chapter of Genesis.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Do you know what, sir, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has said about men?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   This is how he puts it.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   "The strong man armed keepeth his goods in peace."
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And he continues to do so until one stronger than himself comes
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   and despoils him of his armor, and then liberates the goods.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Those are the words of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   His picture of mankind in sin, mankind as the result of this which happened here in paradise, is this,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   that the whole of humanity is like a number of people in a great castle.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   There's a mighty wall surrounding the castle built to an enormous height,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   and this castle is governed by a great chieftain, a great power.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   "The strong man armed keepeth his goods in peace."
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   In a very subtle way, he allows us a certain amount of liberty.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It's a big castle, this. There are extensive grounds.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   There's a sort of parkland, and you can walk backwards and forwards,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   and some people imagine that because they're not chained to a cell in the corner and can move about,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   that they've got absolute liberty.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   But the fact of it is that it's liberty only within the confines of the palace.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   You try to get out if you can.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   You try to scale those walls. You try to make a breach in them.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   You make any effort or endeavor to get into that world that's outside the palace walls,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   and you'll find yourself clubbed back in helplessness.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   "The strong man armed keepeth his goods in peace."
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   They're absolutely under his control.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   That is the view of mankind in sin, which is taken by the Son of God himself.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   And of course, his servants repeat what he said.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Indeed, our Lord himself said it again to one of his most notable servants.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Do you remember the story of Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   seeing the risen Lord, and the Lord giving him a commission?
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   He said, "I'm going to send you now to the people and to the Gentiles."
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   "What for?" "Well," said the Lord, "God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the risen Lord to Saul of Tarsus,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I'm going to send you to them to open their eyes,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   to bring them out of darkness into light,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   and from the power of Satan unto God."
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   There it is again, you see.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   "I'm going to send you out as a preacher," he said, "and as an apostle to these Gentiles,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   to bring them not only from darkness to light, but from the power of Satan unto God."
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   So it's not surprising that this man, when he became the apostle Paul,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   in writing to the Galatians, praises God for the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   because he has delivered us from this present evil world.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   And in the Colossians he says it again, "who has translated us from the kingdom of darkness
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   into the kingdom of his dear Son." It's everywhere.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Mankind then, by nature, is under the dominion and under the authority
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   and under the power of the devil, who rules this world.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   He's the God of this world. He's the prince of the power of the air,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   as we've been seeing recently on Sunday mornings, the spirit that now ruleth in the children of disobedience.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   That's who he is.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   So you see, my friends, the problem confronting every man and woman in this world
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   is not just the problem of certain sins, not the problem of certain weaknesses,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   not simply the problem of desiring to get happiness which we haven't got,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   and a certain amount of understanding and hope and joy, and things like that.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   That's not our problem.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   The problem confronting every one of us is how to escape from the dominion of Satan,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   how to get out of the clutches of the devil,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   how to somehow make an exit out of this kingdom of darkness
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   into light and knowledge and God,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   how to get back into that paradise from which we've been thrust out,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   how to get beyond that flaming sword. That's the problem.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And the whole tragedy of the world this evening is that men and women do not realize that.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   You see, all your philosophic systems, all your educational systems, all your cults,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   they know nothing about that and they're not interested in it.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   They are out to make you feel happier.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   They say, "Of course, we know you're miserable and you'd like to be happy."
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   "Very well, do what we tell you and we'll make you happy."
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And of course, up to a point, they succeed.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   But you see, you can be happy in the grounds of the strongman armed.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   There are poor lunatics who are happy in asylums.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   There are poor drunkards who, having taken a certain amount of alcohol,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   feel perfectly happy.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And everything in the world is perfect.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   They were depressed before they began to drink, that's why they drank.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   But having taken a certain amount, there's no difficulty, there's no problem.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Nothing's wrong at all.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   They are perfectly happy in their experience,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   but oh, the tragedy is they're in bondage and more in it than ever.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Now the cults, you see, and all these other agencies,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   they say they can help us in this respect and the other, and they can,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   but they never face our ultimate problem, the radical difficulty,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   the dominion of Satan, this thing that man got himself into
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   a way back in paradise.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   That's the problem.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And let me say it even at the risk of being misunderstood.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Any evangelism so-called that doesn't deal with this is a false evangelism.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   The test to apply is not whether we feel happier or better,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   not whether we've got a joy which we didn't have before,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   not that we've shed certain sins,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   but are we out from under the dominion of Satan?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Do we know God?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Are we reconciled to him?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Are we really in the light?
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   That's the question.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And here it is, I say, all put before us here.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   For the apostle tells us, you remember, in a striking phrase
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   in his second epistle to the Corinthians in the fourth chapter,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   in the fourth verse, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   lest they believe the glorious gospel of God."
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   He blinds the mind.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   The captivity is such, we're not allowed to think straightly,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   we're not allowed to see the meaning of the gospel.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   He blinds.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Very well, there's the problem.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   There is the situation of mankind.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   What can be done about it?
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I've already told you that men can do nothing about it.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And until you have come to see and to believe and to accept that men can do nothing about it,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   you cannot possibly believe the gospel that's to follow.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   No man will believe in Christ if he thinks he can put himself right.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   A man has to see his hopelessness as a sinner before he ever sees the need of the Savior.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Man is totally helpless.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   He's there like Adam and Eve, shivering, frightened, alarmed, terrified,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   not knowing what to do and listening to the pronouncement of judgment
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   and thrust out into the misery and wretchedness and hopelessness of life.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   But thank God, I say, that's not the end of the story.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   God now announces and reveals his program.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And here it comes in, in this fifteenth verse of this third chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   I'll never allow anybody to take this out of my Bible.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   It's my gospel. It's the beginning of it all.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   I don't understand it apart from this.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   This is the whole message of the Bible.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   It is a message to the effect that God is going to conquer and to defeat Satan
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   and to deliver people from him and his foul dominion.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   That's what it is. Nothing less.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   That's how God himself announces his own gospel.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Not simply to make us happier and better and brighter and all the rest of it. Not at all.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   The problem is to deliver us out of that bondage Satan must be dealt with.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Satan must be conquered and vanquished.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   And God announces his program for accomplishing that great and mighty end.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   That, then, I say, is the message of the whole Bible from here to the very end.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   The Bible is not a book which tells us what we've got to do to put ourselves right.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   The Bible is not a book with just an appeal to us to do this, that, or the other.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   To accept certain ideas and put them into practice.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   It's not a book teaching morality or ethics or anything else.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I'll tell you what it is.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   It's not a book, I say, that asks us primarily to do anything.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   It's a great announcement of what God has done.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   It's God acting. It's the God who comes into the garden to men in his utter hopelessness.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   What if he hadn't done that? I'd have no gospel. There'd be no light.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   The world would be in darkness at this moment. There'd be nothing to say. There'd be no hope.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   But God has come and God has spoken and he's revealed a plan and a program.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   It's revelation, my friends.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It isn't what men think.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   It isn't what men aspire after.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   It isn't what men propose.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   It is entirely from God.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   It's God announcing his program, revealing it.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   I know nothing about it apart from this book.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And it is sure impertinence and ignorance and intellectual arrogance
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   to put you on mind and to say this is right and that's wrong.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   It's either all right or it's all wrong.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   For it all hangs together. It's all of one piece.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   It is a revelation.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   I know nothing about God apart from this.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   I know nothing about a way of salvation apart from this.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I am entirely shut up to this.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And to talk about modern knowledge and recent discoveries
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   and how things are different now from what they were 60 or 70 years ago.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   My dear friends, it's so childish it's really not worth answering.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   We are concerned with the revelation of the eternal God
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   that he has been pleased to make.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   He broke into the tragedy of Eden and he spoke and he's speaking still.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   What has he said?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Well, here it is.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   It shall bruise thy head
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   and thou shalt bruise his heel.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   That's it.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   This is true history.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Now the first thing we have to learn according to the Bible is that there are two histories.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Two sorts of history if you like.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Two types of history.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   There is of course the history that you can read about in your secular history books.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   It is history.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   There is the history of philosophy and of thought,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   the history of art and of culture and of men's endeavors.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Perfectly right, it's all history.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   But there's only one of two histories.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And here you see the Bible comes and speaks plainly to the modern man.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   The tragedy of the modern man, he says that is the whole of history.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   That is the only history.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   But thank God it isn't.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And I thank God it isn't for this reason.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   That all that history, true as it is and in many ways wonderful as it has been,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   gets us nowhere.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   I think I mentioned it last night, last Sunday night, whether I did or not, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   But I agree entirely with those great historians who tell us
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   that all that history is simply a matter of circles.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   That it makes no progress, that there is no advance.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   You know that cyclical view of history, don't you?
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   There's the challenge, here's the response.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And in response to that challenge I get up and I go on and I become strong and mighty.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And at last I conquer. I think I've arrived and that my descendants will advance upwards beyond me.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   But it hasn't happened like that.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   There have been great civilizations in China.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   They've all gone.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   They had great learning, marvelous knowledge, even in a scientific sense.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   It's all somehow become lost.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And they've sunk again, until recently, into a state of ignorance.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   The same was true in Egypt, you remember, mighty dynasties, great civilizations.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   It happened in Greece, it happened in other countries, it happened with Rome, it happened with Spain.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   That's the story. They rise and they go down again. Why?
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Well, according to the great historians, it's simply this, that having arrived and having conquered,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   we begin to rest on our oars.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   We've conquered the most of the world, perhaps, but other people begin to say, "Why should they have all?"
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   They feel the challenge and they make their response.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   They come up, we go down. That's the story of history, isn't it?
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   That's secular history.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   And you know, it's not only true about nations in a military sense.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   It's equally true about knowledge.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Everybody agrees about this, that there have been periods of great knowledge,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   which have been succeeded by periods of darkness and of ignorance.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   We talk about the Middle Ages, the dark ages before the Middle Ages,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   when all the wonderful culture of Greece was entirely lost,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   and Erasmus and others in the 16th century had to rediscover it.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   That's the story.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   I could keep you at very great length and entertain you by telling you some stories about that.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Have you read in a journal how the ancient Chinese knew all about penicillin without giving it the name?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   They did. They knew about it. They were using it.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   They didn't know the name, but they discovered it,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   then it all became lost for so many centuries, and back it's come again.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   My time has gone. I mustn't be tempted to give you an illustration out of my own experience of it.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   But I once knew a research worker, a fellow of the Royal Society,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   who came into my room one day in despair and said, "I'm giving up research work."
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   "Why?" I said. "Well," he said, "I've worked for these years, as you know, on this problem.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I thought I'd made a great discovery.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   I went and read in the Royal College of Surgeons' library,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   and there in a footnote I find that the ancient Egyptians had been doing the very thing
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   that I thought I'd discovered for the first time."
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Well, there you are.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   All that other history is a matter of cycles.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   You just go round and round. You never arrive anywhere.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And in spite of all the years and their travel and their toil,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   man is still in his predicament. He's as miserable and as unhappy and as much a failure as he's ever been.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Thank God there's another history.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   There is a true history. It's this history.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   God initiating a process, raising up a seed that is going to fight this foul tyrant
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   that has conquered men, is going to vanquish him and deliver humanity.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   This spiritual history that runs side by side with the other history,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   intermingles with it now and again, intervenes in it, and yet is always separate.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   The history of the Bible.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Of course these nations are mentioned.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Cultures appear here. Greece and Rome and Egypt, they all come in here.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Yes, but they're mere incidentals.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   The history here is the carrying out of this purpose of Genesis 3.15.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between her seed and thy seed.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Thou, he shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel."
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Do you know, my friends, the Bible is nothing but the outworking of all that.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   That's its message.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   How God is vanquishing and destroying the devil,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   and is ultimately going to undo his nefarious work.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And you notice that God put it like this.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   He said, "There's the plan."
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   And he said at the very beginning that it was going to be absolutely certain.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   That nothing should stop it, and nothing should frustrate it.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   I like the word.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   "He shall bruise thy heel.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Thou, the seed of the woman, shall bruise thy head."
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   The absolute certainty.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   The authority of the eternal God.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Very well, what's happened?
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Well, read your Bibles.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Go through from beginning to end.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Follow it on, keeping your eye on this.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Don't allow yourself to be lost in the details.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Keep your eye on the big thing.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Follow the red line, if you like.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Call it what you will.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Keep to this theme of salvation.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Watch it being worked out.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   The two lines, the two seeds, the conflict.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   It began at once.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   In two of the sons of Adam and Eve,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Abel came.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Came the representative of Satan.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   The man full of hate and of murder in his heart.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   And who murdered his brother.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Yes, but Abel, the seed of the woman,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   raised by God.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   The new line, the conflict.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   They hated one another.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Abel didn't hate Cain.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Cain hated Abel.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   But there was conflict from the very beginning.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And on it goes.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   I'm simply giving you a bird's eye view of the Bible
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   because so many fail to see this.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And thereby they don't understand the Christian message.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Look at it again in Noah and the rest of the world.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Noah and his family, just eight people.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And the whole of the rest of the world,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   the rest was destroyed.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   The eight were saved.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   It's the same conflict.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Those people ridiculed Noah.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   God had raised Noah.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   He made him a preacher of righteousness.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   He revealed his program to him.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And Noah believed it.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And he began building his ark.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   And they said, "The man's mad.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   What's he talking about a flood for?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   He's been saying it for years.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   A hundred years went and nothing happened.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   On the man went with his ark and his preaching.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   And they resisted him.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And they persecuted him.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   But you remember what happened?
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   It's the same conflict.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   The seed of the woman, the seed of the serpent.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Hurry on and come to the call of a man
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   whose name was Abram.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And see how God called him out of his land.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   He came from a pagan land
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   and was undoubtedly brought up as a pagan himself.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   But God called him out and revealed himself to him.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   And said, "Look here, you're a part of my program.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   I'm going to do something in you
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   that's going to eventuate in the Saviour."
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   The seed of the woman, Abram, turned into Abraham.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   And out of his loins comes the nation of Israel.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   God's chosen special people.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   The bearers of his oracles.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   The ones who speak with his authoritative voice.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   But they're opposed by the nations.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   The devil even gets into the camp of God's people.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   He leads them into sin.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   There's a struggle within the nation
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   as well as with the nations outside.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   It's nothing but the conflict between the seed of the woman
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and the seed of the serpent.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Follow it right through.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   It's such a breathless story.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   There are times when you feel that God's going to lose.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   The enemy seems to be triumphant.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   The children of Israel have almost gone.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   There's nobody left who's a believer.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Poor Elijah, sitting under his juniper tree said,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   "I alone am left."
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   But he was wrong.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   There were another 7,000.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   But so it appears at times.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   You read and you say, "What's going to happen?"
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   The seed of the woman's about being exterminated.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   The devil is so mighty, he has such great forces.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   He's triumphant all along the line.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   What can happen?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Oh, here's the fight and the conflict.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   It goes on.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   And people began to feel hopeless.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   So God began to send them special messengers called prophets.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Who said, "It's all right, hold on.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   My purpose is still sure.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   I'm going to send thee, Deliverer.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   A Messiah is going to appear."
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   And they waited and the years passed and he didn't come.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   But he raised another messenger who said the same thing.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   And they came one after another.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   And then there was a terrible 400 years
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   when there was no word from God.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   After Malachi, dead silence.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   And people said, "Where is God?
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   What is happening?"
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   The enemy was powerful.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   There were terrible persecutions.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   And even Jerusalem and the Holy Land were conquered by the Roman Empire.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   The devil seems triumphant.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   The seed of the serpent has prevailed.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   No, he hasn't.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   When the fullness of the times had come,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   God sent forth his Son,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   made of a woman,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   made under the law to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Here is the real seed of the woman.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   A virgin birth, you see.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Not man as the father.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Born of a virgin, conceived by the Holy Ghost.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   The seed of the woman has arrived.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   But watch the conflict now.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   King Herod as the seed of Satan tried to kill him even when he was an infant, you remember?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   You remember the story?
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Read your first chapters again of Matthew's Gospel.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   See the seed of the serpent trying to destroy him, but he failed.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   It didn't end there, alas.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Watch him being tempted of the devil forty days and forty nights in the wilderness.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Keep your eye on the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Was there ever such malignity, such hatred?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Such devilry rampant?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Go and read your four Gospels.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Look how they treated this Son of God,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   who came to save, who worked miracles, who was always doing acts of kindness.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Look at what the world did to Him.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   He came unto His own and His own received Him not.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   They threw stones at Him.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   They spat in His face.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   They all joined in a mighty chorus and said,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   "Away with Him, crucify Him.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Give us a robber rather than this man."
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   What is it?
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   It's nothing but the enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   And look at it reaching its intensity there in that hall of trial,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   when all the powers are set against Him,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   and when they condemn Him.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   And there I see Him nailed to the tree.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   The seed of the woman is conquering, isn't He?
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   He's brought it about.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   He's entered into Judas.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   He's incarnated Himself, as it were, in Judas.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   And there He is.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   They've got Him.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   They're nailing Him.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   They're killing Him.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   He's expiring.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   The seed of the serpent has conquered.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Now, now.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   Do you know what was happening there?
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   What was really happening there, according to the Apostle Paul in the second chapter of the epistle to the Colossians, was this.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   That He who was dying was there triumphing over the principalities and powers.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Putting them to an open shame and triumphing over them in it, in that very thing.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   He did die and He was buried.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   And they thought they'd sealed their victory by putting the stone over the mouth of that grave and sealing it.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   But He burst asunder the bands of death and arose triumphant over the grave.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   He went out leaving the death clothes alone as evidence in the tomb.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   And He manifested Himself to the people.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   And He arose and sent the Holy Ghost.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   What am I talking about?
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Well, my dear friends, this is the drama of salvation.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   This is the exposition of what we're told in Genesis 3.15.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   It's the whole story of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   You notice how it was put by God Himself?
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   "He shall bruise thy head, and it shall bruise his heel."
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   It's a terrible fight, this.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   The devil is so powerful, he's so mighty, he's so strong, he's so subtle,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   that he takes the power of God to deal with him and to vanquish him.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   And the victory over the devil is not possible without this incident, this episode.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   "It shall bruise his heel."
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   And he was bruised.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   He died.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   The devil thought he'd killed him.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   He'd only bruised his heel.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   He'd forgotten what God had said in Eden.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   But he did bruise his heel.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   There is no deliverance from Satan except through the death of Christ.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   It meant that that's how he delivers.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   His heel was bruised.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   He suffered.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   He bore the punishment.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   He did die.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Literally tasted death for every man.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   But in so doing, he has bruised the serpent's death.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   He said just before that death of his,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   "Now is the prince of this world cast out.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Now is the judgment of this world."
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   He delivered him on that occasion a mortal wound.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   By his death, the Lord Jesus Christ, says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews in the second chapter,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   "Has destroyed the works of the devil, him that had the power of death and held all men in bondage."
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   He's robbed him of that power.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   He's taken the sting out of death.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   He's delivered the devil a mortal wound from which he will never recover.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   But the end has not yet come.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Since then, the victory has been continuing.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   The sending of the Holy Ghost has had this effect,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   that the fight still goes on with a greater intensity.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   And the gospel, this gospel I'm preaching unto you,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   is being preached to tell men and women that the devil has received that mortal wound
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   and that all who look to Christ and who trust in him and believe in him
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   can be taken out of the dominion of Satan,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   can be rescued and redeemed.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   "Go and tell them," says the Lord to Paul on the road to Damascus,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   "that the way is wide open. They have but to come out in the strength of my victory."
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And it has been preached ever since.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   And when it goes in the power of the Holy Ghost,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   it convicts men of their bondage to Satan, of their helplessness and hopelessness.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   It opened their eyes to the salvation in Christ.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   And it brings them out. And it's going on.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   And it will go on.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Until the day comes
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   when this selfsame seed of the woman, the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   will come back again.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   And he'll come back finally to rout all his enemies.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Satan and all who belong to him will be cast into the lake of perdition.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Evil and all its vestiges will be burned out of existence.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   There shall be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   And Satan will finally be destroyed to all eternity.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   And Jesus shall reign where'er the sun doth his successive journeys run.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   His kingdom stretch from shore to shore till moons shall wax and wane no more.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   A day is coming when Satan shall not only be bound but shall be cast to destruction.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And sin and evil shall be no more.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   He shall bruise thy head.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   God in Christ will finally be perfectly and completely victorious.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   And the devil will be robbed and shorn of all his power and his might.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Friends, is the Christian message.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   And it comes to you, you see, like this.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   By nature you belong to the devil.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   That's why the world is living as it is, because it belongs to him.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   That's why it laughs at the gospel and ridicules talk about the blood of Christ.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   It's blinded by its God, its master, the strong man armed.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   And this is the terrifying thought.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   If you die like that, you will go to the same misery, the same destruction,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   and the same wretchedness as the devil and all his fossils.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   But if you believe that God sent his own Son into this world
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   to deliver you and to rescue you from that bondage, from those horrid clutches,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   and to transfer you to his own kingdom, and to make you his son,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   and to shower his blessings upon you,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   you have nothing to fear about the end of the world, nor of the judgment of God,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   because in Christ you have already passed from judgment to life.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   The devil can't touch you.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   The whole world, says John in his first epistle, "lieth in the evil one,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   but the evil one toucheth us not."
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   We belong to God, and God's seed is in us.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   What's the blood that's in you? What's the seed that's in you?
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   Is it the seed of the devil?
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Or do you belong to the seed of the woman?
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Have you received the seed divine?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Have you been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever?
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   My dear friend, this is not remote. I'm talking about you.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   You are either in the hands of the devil, or you're in the hands of God.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   And your eternal fate will correspond.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   But if you are in the hands of the devil, I plead with you,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   recognize your position and your condition.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   Hearken unto this wonderful message about God sending his own Son,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   made of a woman, seed of the woman, to rescue and redeem you.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Cast yourself upon him. Speak to him. Tell him,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   "Though I cannot see you, I believe you are there. I believe the message.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Deliver me." And he will deliver you.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   And you will be given a new life and a new strength and a new power.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   And you will be enabled to resist the devil,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   and have the wonderful experience, for the first time in your life,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   of seeing him fleeing from you.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Because he cannot withstand the name and the blood of the Christ that is now upon you.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Amen.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
