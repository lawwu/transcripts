[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   There's another thing that happened recently, and I get lots of listener
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.840]   questions about it, and that is how to avoid annual fees.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.980]   My favorite option happened this year when I got my $695 Amex platinum annual fee.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.240]   I pop open the live chat on the Amex site.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.280]   I said, Hey, I noticed my annual fee has just posted and it just feels
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.040]   high relative to all the benefits.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.680]   I asked if there were any way to get it reduced at all.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.280]   Took a little bit of back and forth.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.980]   The agent is always saying, Hey, let me tell you about this.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.040]   Have you heard about this benefit?
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.120]   Have you heard about this benefit?
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.840]   And ultimately you get an offer.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.560]   This year, my offer was 25,000 points.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.840]   If I can put $3,000 on the card in the next three months, that's over nine
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.460]   points per dollar, so that's worth at least $400 to me, and so I said, yes,
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.520]   I moved on and I'm going to cut my annual fee down by more than 50%.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.240]   It took less than five minutes and I was able to do it on live chat.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.600]   So I was also able to get some work done at the same time.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.080]   Highly recommend anyone with a high annual fee on a card.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.000]   You'd like to keep just going and asking.
