[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.480]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.440]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.360]   And I'm wearing these Red Lens Wind Down Roka glasses
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.280]   because we are recording this late at night,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.000]   which is unusual for us.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.040]   And bright light,
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.560]   in particular short wavelength bright light
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.040]   in the blue and green part of the spectrum
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.440]   quashes melatonin and it makes it hard to sleep.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.600]   And I wanna sleep tonight.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.720]   These Red Lens glasses filter out
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.720]   the green and blue short wavelengths
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.320]   that would otherwise disrupt my sleep.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.840]   My guest today is Dr. Ethan Cross.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.280]   Dr. Ethan Cross is a professor of psychology
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.880]   at the University of Michigan
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.400]   and the director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.160]   He is also the author of the best-selling book, "Chatter,"
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.840]   the voice in our head and how to harness it.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.000]   Today's discussion is a really special one
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.920]   because we discuss something that each and all of us have,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.520]   which is a voice in our head that is our voice.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.400]   And that voice can range from encouraging to discouraging.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.480]   It can be repetitive in ways that can be very intrusive,
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.600]   and it has a profound effect on our emotional state,
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.840]   our confidence, our levels of anxiety,
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.920]   and indeed what we are capable of achieving in life.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.400]   Dr. Ethan Cross's laboratory
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.480]   has done groundbreaking research to understand
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.080]   what is the origin of this voice in our heads
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.040]   and can and should we control it?
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.940]   And indeed the answer is yes.
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.000]   Today's discussion gets into many things
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.320]   that people struggle with
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800]   and many things that you can do to improve your life,
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.200]   such as how to regulate the chatter in your head,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.080]   how to overcome ruminations and intrusive thoughts.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.940]   And we also discuss what to do with your actual voice.
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.200]   For instance, data pointing to the fact
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.100]   that venting your negative emotions to others
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.120]   is actually bad.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.520]   It tends to amplify bad emotions.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.580]   We talk about that research.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.860]   We also talk about other forms of outward speech
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.440]   and inward speech, that inner voice that you can partake in
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.440]   in order to improve your emotional state
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.280]   and shift your emotional state.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.320]   So today's discussion really centers around common questions
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.480]   and common scenarios and common challenges
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   that everybody grapples with.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.940]   And of course, we all have a voice in our head.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.880]   Today you're gonna learn to listen to it, to regulate it,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.760]   and indeed to steer it in the direction of mental health,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.600]   physical health, and performance.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.880]   I'm also excited to tell you that Dr. Ethan Cross
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.100]   soon has another book coming out entitled
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.800]   "Shift, Managing Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You."
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.480]   And I tremendously enjoyed "Chatter," his first book,
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.640]   and I very much look forward to reading "Shift"
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.560]   when it comes out.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.480]   We provide links to the work in Dr. Ethan Cross's laboratory
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.160]   as well as links to his previous and forthcoming book
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.660]   in the show note captions.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.380]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.180]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.380]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.340]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.340]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.720]   to the general public.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.820]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.820]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.420]   Our first sponsor is ExpressVPN.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.900]   ExpressVPN is a virtual private network
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.340]   that keeps your data secure and private.
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.620]   It does that by routing your internet activity
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.620]   through their servers and encrypting it
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.980]   so that no one can see or sell your data.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.820]   Now, I'm personally familiar with the effects
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.980]   of not securing my data well enough.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.820]   Several years ago, I had one of my bank accounts hacked,
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.740]   and it was a terrible amount of work
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.160]   to try and have that reversed and the account secured.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.100]   So after that happened,
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.980]   I talked to my friends in the tech community,
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.980]   and they told me that even though you may think
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.260]   your internet connection is secure, oftentimes it is not,
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.220]   especially if you're using Wi-Fi networks,
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.220]   such as those on planes and hotels and coffee shops
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.460]   and other public areas.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.620]   In fact, even when you're on the internet at home,
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.700]   your data may not be as secure as you think.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.440]   The great thing about ExpressVPN
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.460]   is that I don't even notice that it's running
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.660]   since the connection it provides is so fast.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.540]   I have it on my computer and on my phone,
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.500]   and I just keep it on
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.140]   whenever I'm connected to the internet.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.220]   If you wanna start protecting your internet activity
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.220]   using ExpressVPN, you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman,
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.580]   and you can get an extra three months free.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.580]   Again, that's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com/huberman
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.780]   to get an extra three months free.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.980]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.740]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.260]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.440]   One of the best ways to ensure
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.900]   that you get a great night's sleep every single night
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.740]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.820]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.660]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.380]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.100]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.220]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.980]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.000]   Eight Sleep makes it easy to control the temperature
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.420]   of your sleeping environment
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.180]   by allowing you to program the temperature
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.340]   of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle,
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.620]   and end of the night.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.380]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.940]   for nearly four years now,
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.740]   and it has completely improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.900]   Eight Sleep has now launched
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.060]   their newest generation pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.940]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.180]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.740]   and even has snoring detection
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.040]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.620]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.760]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.200]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.720]   to access their Black Friday offer right now.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.060]   With this Black Friday discount,
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.320]   you can save up to $600 off on their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.600]   This is Eight Sleep's biggest sale of the year.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.080]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, the UK,
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.600]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.640]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.040]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Ethan Cross.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.380]   Dr. Ethan Cross, welcome.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.640]   - Great to be here.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.920]   - Right before we went hot mics, as they say,
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.800]   we were talking about interrupting one another
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.660]   and the fact that you're from New York.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.040]   I'm gonna try not to interrupt you
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.480]   because the audience doesn't like that.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.800]   However, I am very interested
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.320]   in what you're gonna tell us about emotion regulation,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.920]   but especially this thing that you call chatter,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.000]   the voice in our heads.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.240]   And prior to learning about your work,
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.120]   I always thought that chatter and the voice in our heads
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.620]   was overwhelmingly negative.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.460]   That's what we hear.
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.220]   How do you combat that negative voice in one's head?
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.300]   But you have some very interesting ideas
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.700]   about the utility of chatter,
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.800]   like maybe how it even arose and what it's for.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.540]   So maybe we start there.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.460]   - Yeah, so I think this is a great question
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.180]   because the inner voice is something that we carry with us
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.660]   wherever we go, but we don't tend to learn what it is.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.580]   And actually sometimes I get up there and speak to people
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.780]   and they often wonder like,
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.340]   what is a purported serious scientist doing
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.020]   talking about a squishy topic
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.480]   like the voice inside our heads?
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.060]   And it turns out that this is a remarkable tool
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.960]   of the human mind.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.380]   So when I use the term inner voice,
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.220]   what I'm talking about is our ability
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.800]   to silently use language to reflect on things in our lives.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.980]   And it turns out that's a type of Swiss army knife
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.820]   that we possess.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.060]   It lets us do many different things.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.740]   So just from the outset,
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.740]   let me distinguish chatter from other inner voice operations.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.140]   I think of chatter as a dark side of the inner voice.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.140]   And we'll get to that in a little bit.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.660]   But having the ability to silently use language,
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.060]   that is a boon to the human condition.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.900]   So I'll give you a couple of benefits that it serves.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.060]   What's your favorite sports team?
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.200]   - The Harlem Globetrotters
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.420]   because they're undefeated as I understand.
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.260]   - Oh.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.580]   - Yeah, the best record in any sport.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.940]   I don't think they've ever lost a game.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.860]   - Do they ever play against other teams?
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.980]   - The Washington Generals.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.380]   - Okay, sorry for the Washington Generals.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.620]   So if you were to go to a game and root for them,
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.220]   what would you say?
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.300]   - Go Globetrotters.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.140]   - Go Globetrotters.
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.300]   Okay, can you repeat that phrase silently
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.100]   three times in your head right now?
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.460]   - Yes.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.300]   - Okay, you've just used your inner voice.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.860]   So your inner voice is part of what we call
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.360]   our verbal working memory system,
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.940]   basic system of the human mind
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.880]   that lets us do something that I think is both extraordinary
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.860]   but totally ordinary also.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.660]   Your verbal working memory system, it's a mouthful,
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.460]   lets you keep information active for short periods of time.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.980]   So before we had cell phones,
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.740]   how did you memorize phone numbers?
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.580]   Like what would you do?
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.700]   Repeat it in your head.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.340]   - Yeah, and it has sort of a song to it.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.180]   - Yeah.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.780]   - I can remember my childhood phone number still
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.900]   even though that number is long since gone.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.980]   - Long since gone.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.980]   - Even the whole area code's gone in fact.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.820]   - Really?
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.500]   - Well, the number is probably still there
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.660]   but under a different area code.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.100]   I know 'cause I tried calling it every once in a while.
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:47.940]   - Interesting.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.740]   Well, it's funny when I go through this content,
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.540]   I give talks or workshops, I often say 2090501,
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.460]   repeat that in your head three times.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.780]   That's my childhood phone number.
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.480]   I'm like, go give it a shot, give them a call.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.820]   So for all I know,
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.580]   that person may be getting lots of phone calls.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.520]   It's not my phone number.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.740]   But that's your verbal working memory system.
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.900]   You go to the grocery store
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.660]   and you try to remember what you were supposed to get.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.380]   Most people don't do that out loud.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.660]   Like, oh crap, what was I supposed to get?
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.180]   Milk, cheese, eggs.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.280]   You repeat that silently in your head.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.140]   So that's one thing your inner voice allows you to do.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.180]   Keep information active, verbal information.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.780]   Your inner voice also helps you simulate and plan.
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.240]   So before presentations or interviews,
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.340]   a lot of people report going over what they're going to say
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.940]   before that event.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.780]   Do you ever do this?
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.820]   - Yeah, my mode of preparation
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.580]   for things like solo podcasts and talks
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.580]   is it's not scripted out line by line in advance,
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.980]   but I have a structure in my mind.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.180]   And it's more like remembering the first line
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.380]   of each paragraph in my head,
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.380]   and then the rest just kind of falls out.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.540]   - Yeah, we have a very similar style.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.220]   I will bullet out what the key ideas are.
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.820]   And as long as I could bullet that out, I am good to go.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.220]   But I will also rehearse those bullets in my head, A, B, C, D.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.340]   So that's you using your inner voice as well.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.180]   Now, before a big presentation, like a live event,
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.940]   I will go over the opening to my presentation,
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.020]   and sometimes just carry that dialogue through
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.260]   when I'm going for a walk around the hotel
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.180]   before the event.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.360]   - May I ask about the walk?
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.660]   When I prepare for live events or solo podcasts,
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.180]   and long before I was involved in either of those activities
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:47.020]   for lectures of any kind or classroom discussions
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.980]   where I had to stand up in front of the class,
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.740]   I would find that walking and listening to a song
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.260]   would, maybe simultaneously, maybe separately,
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.360]   would dramatically shape the kind of cadence and energy
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.300]   of the delivery of the talk.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.500]   - Yeah, I love the fact that you brought up songs there.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.780]   So if we wanna take a little detour here,
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.460]   so in my new book, "Shift," we talk about,
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.180]   or I talk about how the different shifters that exist
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.620]   to push your emotions around and sensation,
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.580]   sensory experiences are one powerful,
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.620]   and I would argue often overlooked modality
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.900]   for shifting our emotions.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.700]   So if you ask people, "Why do you listen to music?"
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.380]   What do you think most people say?
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.580]   - It makes me feel good.
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.500]   - Feel, right?
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.900]   It's about emotions, feel good.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.780]   So one study, the number was around like 95, 96%
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.740]   of participants who were asked said,
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.620]   "Exactly gave the answer that you just gave."
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.980]   But then if you look at, in other studies,
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.540]   "Hey, the last time you felt anxious or angry or sad,
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.100]   "what did you do to push your emotions around?"
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.740]   The number of people who report using music
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.020]   to modulate their experience drops way down 10 to 30%.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.740]   Music is a really powerful tool
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.200]   for modulating our emotions.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   I actually, an unintentional parenting victory for me
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.260]   was when my youngest daughter was around five or six
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.140]   and I was coaching soccer.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.300]   I lived for these soccer games on the weekend.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.260]   I wasn't one of these overbearing coaches
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260]   who would go crazy on the sidelines.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.260]   It was just such joy to just watch these kids play.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.140]   And typically my daughter was really excited
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.020]   to go to the game.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.860]   But one morning she was just like not into it at all.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.180]   She was bummed out, it was bumming me out.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.840]   I was catching her emotions.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.420]   We can talk about emotional contagion later.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.420]   And got into the car and it just so happened
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.260]   that my cell phone was connected
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.620]   and the next song on the playlist
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.500]   happened to be "Journey's Don't Stop Believin'".
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.160]   So you know the song, I presume.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.680]   Don't judge me for having this on my playlist, please.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   The song comes on and I start jamming out to it,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.140]   singing out loud like an embarrassing dad.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.900]   And then I look in the back seat
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.940]   and I find her bopping her head.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.260]   And then the chorus comes, we get really excited
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.420]   and then I pull up to the soccer field
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.860]   and she just bursts out of the car and is like invigorated.
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.720]   That is the power of music to impact us.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   So I will often also have songs on prior to big talks
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.460]   that I'm getting ready to get in that mental frame of mind.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.720]   And I don't think it's a coincidence
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.840]   that many athletes do this as well.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.360]   They've stumbled onto this tool
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.240]   that is quite powerful for pointing our emotional experience
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.640]   or our emotional trajectory
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.660]   in the direction we want it to point, so.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.500]   - It's interesting.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.000]   I was thinking about music in reference to shifting emotion
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.080]   as you just gave an example of.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.780]   You know, feeling like amotivated
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.120]   and then your daughter's motivated by the don't stop.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.420]   Right, you know, okay, I'm not gonna sing it.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.260]   - Keep going.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.100]   - We'll do it together.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:10.920]   - I will not do that.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.540]   Someone will cut the clip and they'll run it out.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.840]   They'll spill it out and then no,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.140]   I have a truly terrible singing voice.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:20.280]   But I wonder, has the study ever been done
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.400]   or something similar to this
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   where people who are feeling pretty good or very good
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.640]   are exposed to sadder music and vice versa?
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.640]   People are feeling sad as opposed to sort of ecstatic music
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.560]   or positive lyrics.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.140]   Because I've often wondered whether or not humans
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.920]   like or dislike when things
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.120]   or people try and shift their state.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.040]   You know, I know in myself,
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.400]   when I'm like feeling upset about something,
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.560]   I don't want to feel upset.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.000]   I don't think anyone wants to feel upset.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   But if I hear a song that's positive,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.960]   there's a moment where I'm like,
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   I can feel it kind of pulling on me.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.040]   And you sort of know, like I could follow that trajectory
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.080]   and probably get out of this.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.480]   And sometimes one does, and sometimes one doesn't.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.040]   - You know, and this gets to,
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.400]   I think a more fundamental issue,
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.900]   which is why I'm asking,
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.000]   which is, are we supposed to feel our emotions
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.640]   as a way to sort of dissolve them when we don't want them,
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.440]   kind of the cathartic approach,
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.520]   or would listening to sad music when we're sad
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.440]   just amplify the sadness?
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.680]   - These are great questions.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.360]   And I have a couple of,
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.200]   they touch on a couple of amazingly important issues
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.080]   that we need to get into.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.260]   So let's just do them serially.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.240]   So number one, has the study been done
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.220]   where you expose people to different kinds of music,
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.040]   sad versus arousing, you know, happy music?
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.220]   Do you see that push people's emotions around?
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.060]   Yes.
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.680]   In fact, sensory tools like music or visual images
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.640]   are one of the most powerful tools
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.660]   that we have in our arsenal
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.520]   for pushing people's emotions around
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.080]   in the context of experiments.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.960]   So we want to induce a particular kind of state.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.740]   We can play certain kinds of music
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.440]   or show people images that are designed to elicit positive
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.200]   or negative emotional experiences.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.120]   So images being another sensory modality, vision.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.960]   So that's number one.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.640]   Number two, there's this very interesting phenomenon
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.480]   where when we are in a particular emotional state,
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.580]   let's say we're feeling sad,
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.080]   we often don't reflexively seek out the happy music.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.440]   We don't go to Journey.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.280]   Instead, we go to Adele, right?
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.520]   We're going to Chicago.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.340]   I'm giving you my age bracket here, right?
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.080]   Like the music that has sad associations for me.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.960]   So there's this mood congruency.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.360]   If I'm feeling a certain way,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.640]   I'm gonna go deeper into that state
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.080]   and have the music facilitate me.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.040]   Why on earth would we do that?
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.200]   Are we all masochistic?
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.680]   Do we just want to feel even worse?
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.960]   This gets at, I think, a critically important point
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.720]   that is not always talked about,
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.720]   which is all emotions are functional
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.080]   when they are experienced in the right proportions,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.720]   not too intensely and not too long.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.480]   So sadness, as an example, is an emotion we experience
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.340]   when we've experienced some loss
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.440]   that we can't rectify right away.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.480]   Like something has happened and you can't fix that.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   So you've lost someone.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.860]   And so what does this emotion do?
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.080]   Well, it hijacks the way we are thinking,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.240]   feeling, and our bodies are responding.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.880]   So it motivates us to introspect,
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.440]   to turn our attention inward,
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.260]   to reflect on this situation,
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.200]   to now try to make sense of it, right?
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.520]   Something really important in my life has happened.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.720]   I now have to change the way I'm thinking about my life
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.260]   so I can find meaning and move on.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.200]   My physiology is slowing down
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.360]   so I can engage in that slow introspection.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.420]   But what's also really interesting about sadness is
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.680]   it's also impacting my facial display,
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.960]   giving a sign to all of the people in my environment
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.580]   to say, "Hey, maybe we should check up on that person,
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.780]   "that guy, 'cause he looks like he's on his own
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.920]   "in a corner," right?
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.880]   So can you detect when someone is sad,
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.080]   if you see like a sad facial expression?
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.800]   - Yes, when I used to teach the summer courses
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.960]   at Cold Spring Harbor on the North Shore of Long Island,
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.720]   that students would come in from all over the world.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.560]   - I've been there.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.720]   - It's a great place. - Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.740]   - Summer camp for scientists,
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.400]   I'll have their laboratories all year.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.960]   And I eventually was director of a course there
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.980]   and my co-director and I used to have this debrief
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.800]   at the end of the first day or two
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.360]   where we would talk to one another
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.680]   and we would go over the list of names and we'd say,
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.600]   and she was remarkably good at this,
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.940]   just extraordinary, like a superpower at saying,
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.020]   "You know, I think everyone's settling in well,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.600]   "but I noticed that so-and-so was kind of like,
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.100]   "might not be adjusted to the jet lag
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.320]   "or might not be acclimating so well."
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.780]   And it's a very tight-knit group
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.320]   and the course is quite long for a course like that,
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   but it's important that everybody
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.440]   kind of feel engaged early on.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.360]   - Yeah.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.880]   - And people have a tendency to dominate
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.120]   in those intellectually competitive environments
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.160]   and she could just pinpoint who it was
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.120]   that was feeling a little bit outside the group.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.560]   We knew how to ameliorate that really quickly.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.160]   And from her, I learned a bit of how to recognize the signs
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.900]   and it was rarely just facial expression included that
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.820]   and some other cues that she just seemed to have
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.120]   a unconscious or conscious genius around.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.260]   So for me, I learned some of that from her.
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.540]   I like to think I got better at it,
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.780]   but I think some people are just extraordinarily good
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.980]   at that detection.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.420]   - And it enhances social interactions.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.940]   And so some people are really good at detecting it.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.940]   Others are really good at displaying it.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.460]   I'm gonna go back to my daughter.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.240]   So, you know, if something happens where she feels sad,
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.360]   she exhibits this exaggerated response,
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.640]   like she'll stick out her lower lip.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.960]   And even if I'm kind of upset at her,
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.560]   like it is amazing the power that that has on me.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.960]   - Melted, melted.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   - It is so, so beautifully manipulating.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.920]   - Manipulative, you know, no, manipulative.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.440]   And it's a testament to the power
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.200]   that these displays can have on us.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.300]   - So I wanna go back to one other question you raised
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.700]   in your last comment.
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.160]   And we'll go back to the inner voice and its functionality.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.780]   You raised the question about being shifted by others,
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.080]   other people, and perhaps either just our surroundings,
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.140]   music or spaces.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.180]   Sometimes you don't want to have your emotions be shifted.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.140]   And in fact, when other people try to do that,
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.420]   it can elicit what we call reactance.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.340]   Like you get defensive because I don't want you pushing me
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.600]   in a particular direction.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.060]   I think that's a really important point
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:05.060]   that we need to be aware of as people living and working
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.660]   in these social environments
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.420]   where we're often well-intentioned,
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.860]   but sometimes our well-intentioned behaviors can backfire.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.220]   And so there's this beautiful research
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:20.500]   which shows that if you see someone suffering
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.520]   and you volunteer to help them
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.300]   and they haven't asked you to help them,
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.940]   that can blow up in your face.
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.860]   Because what it does is it often communicates to people
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.160]   that you are thinking that they're not capable
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.620]   of handling their own circumstances.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.900]   And most of us, we're motivated to think
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.600]   that we're capable of handling ourselves.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.940]   And so there are still ways you can help people
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.060]   in those circumstances.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.740]   It's called providing invisible support,
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.220]   which involves providing support to the person
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.860]   who can genuinely benefit from it,
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.720]   but not shining a spotlight on the fact
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.240]   that that is what you are doing.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.460]   So how might this transpire?
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.140]   There's some really simple things you could do.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.140]   So let's say my wife is really overwhelmed with stuff
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.960]   and she hasn't asked me for help,
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.380]   but I know she is at her wits end work
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.480]   and kids and other kinds of stuff that are on her plate.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.900]   I can proactively do things to lessen her burden.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.220]   If it's her turn to pick up the dry cleaning
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.500]   in the groceries, I'm doing that voluntarily.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.820]   I'm doing that and I'm not coming home and saying,
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.540]   hey sweetie, look what I did today.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.940]   I did all these things, can I have a pat on my back?
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.960]   That's not what we're talking about.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   It's about your group, your lab is working under a deadline
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.340]   to submit a grant application
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.100]   and they don't have time to eat
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.780]   and you proactively have pizza delivered to the lab.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.380]   It's those little things that can help.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.660]   Give you two more examples.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.880]   Let's say that someone on your team is really struggling
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.540]   with their ability to translate their work
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.580]   for popular audiences
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.580]   and that's something they're motivated to do.
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.260]   Really important skill for a scientist
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.260]   to be able to translate what they do for others to consume.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.260]   Before you pull them aside and say,
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.500]   hey, you know, I noticed that you're stumbling
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.300]   on a few different issues
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.160]   and here are a couple of things I think you can do better.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.180]   Before you do that direct intervention,
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.940]   you might have a team meeting
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.620]   where you share out best practices.
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.320]   Hey, what are the two things that I've learned
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.180]   that really have benefited my ability
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.180]   to communicate with different audiences?
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.780]   What you're doing there is you're getting people
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.220]   the resources they can benefit from,
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.420]   but you're not shining a spotlight on the fact
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.900]   that you are directing it to them.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:50.900]   So it's kind of a back doorway of helping or of shifting.
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.740]   The last tool I'll mention brings it back to sensation.
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.620]   One of the most powerful ways we can shift other people
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.100]   is through touch, tactile sensation.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.740]   You know, what's the first thing that you do with a child
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.180]   to soothe them when they are born?
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.500]   Hold them, hold them.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.900]   Skin-to-skin contact.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.780]   I remember both times my kids were born,
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.580]   it was like, you know, I wanna get in on that,
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.660]   like, you know, 'cause my wife got first dibs
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.780]   with both of our daughters.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.680]   Like, I want some of that, you know, skin-to-skin contact.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.780]   That doesn't end after we leave the womb.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.940]   The comfort that we experience,
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.820]   the release of stress-fighting chemicals that occurs
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.780]   when affectionate embraces are registered,
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.780]   that continues throughout the lifespan.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.860]   So if my daughters, who don't particularly like dad
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.660]   to volunteer advice to them on most things nowadays,
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.100]   if I know they're having a bad day, like, I'll go over
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.220]   and I'll rub their back in a totally uncreepy way.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.020]   That is an important caveat we should give
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.540]   to everyone who's listening.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.940]   What we're talking about here is affectionate
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.800]   but not creepy or unwanted touch.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.940]   It is touch that is mutually desired,
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.820]   and there is some research which shows actually
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.740]   that when it is not desired, you don't get these benefits.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.940]   And in fact, you get the opposite,
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.660]   plus usually like lawsuits as well.
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.500]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.500]   No, I definitely believe that as a primate species,
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.260]   which we are, we are old world primates,
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.500]   I think they call it allopathic grooming.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.400]   You'll see these images of these monkeys
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.360]   and lots of different species of primates,
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.100]   just sitting nearby one another where one just has
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.100]   it's even just it's hand, it's paw on the one next to it.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:51.660]   And they'll just sit like that for long periods of time.
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.820]   And then sometimes they're doing like an active grooming
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.700]   of removing parasites.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.840]   This is very important in the primate world, as we know.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.840]   But grooming and picking in these kinds of things,
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.820]   you see it in couples.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.380]   It's actually can be kind of endearing.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.140]   I suppose at its extremes, it's kind of gross,
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:13.140]   but it's rather endearing to see somebody
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.540]   kind of like remove a piece of lint off somebody,
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.540]   their partner's jacket, or even just touch that is,
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.620]   it doesn't look like it's geared
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.220]   towards any specific outcome.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.060]   - Yeah.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:31.300]   - And it doesn't necessarily appear romantic
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.600]   or that it's grooming.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.500]   So maybe the lint example isn't the best one,
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.220]   but where you just see people that are just like,
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.940]   actually on the flight down this morning,
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.300]   so I had to fly in early, I was sitting on the aisle seat.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.740]   In the middle was a boy.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.500]   He was probably 14, 15.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.580]   And his mom was at the window seat.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.260]   And I went up to use the restroom, came back,
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.420]   and he had fallen asleep on his mom's shoulder.
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.540]   And I took a look, it was a very endearing moment.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.820]   And then when we landed, I said,
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.820]   the ability to sleep anywhere is a superpower.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.700]   And he said, I learned it from my dad.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.040]   And it was a moment where I just thought,
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.080]   it was just a very pleasant thing to see them
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.200]   in this touch on the plane.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.440]   He clearly felt comfortable enough to do that.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.600]   I remember thinking like, yeah,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.480]   humans were a lot like the other primates.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.120]   - Yeah, there's a beauty to it.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.080]   And it is a tool.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.000]   It is one kind of shifter that has to be obviously used
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.460]   in the appropriate context.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.080]   All of our sensory modalities are powerful tools
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.680]   for, I would argue, relatively effortlessly
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.780]   shifting our emotions.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.160]   And I think that's really important
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.160]   because people often think that regulating our emotions
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.440]   is hard work to the extent that they believe
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.040]   you can regulate your emotions at all.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.260]   We'll talk about that a little bit too, I'm sure.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.920]   But self-control, emotion regulation,
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.640]   like let me roll up my sleeves
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.280]   and really kind of get in there.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.680]   Yes, it can at times be extraordinarily difficult
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.880]   to manage our emotions.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.320]   And some of the tools that we have are effortful.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   One example would be expressive writing.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.600]   It's a wonderful tool
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.160]   for working through problematic experiences.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.140]   You sit down, just let yourself go
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.680]   for 15 to 20 minutes a day for one to three days.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.520]   - This is the Pennebaker.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.040]   - This is the Pennebaker writing effect.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   This is just a remarkably wonderful side effect free,
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.840]   you could argue intervention for helping you deal
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.680]   with curve balls that life throws at you.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.140]   We have vast amounts of data supporting the practice.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:28.980]   - Vast amounts of data.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.160]   - The Pennebaker really deserves, in my opinion,
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.500]   if not the psychology equivalent of a Nobel Prize,
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.340]   I don't know what that is,
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:41.320]   but it deserves real deep praise
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.080]   for developing that method
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.280]   because it's essentially zero cost,
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.680]   takes a little bit of time.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.960]   And there's just, what, hundreds of studies?
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.800]   - Hundreds of studies, that's right.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.440]   - Showing that these 10 to 15 minute cathartic writing,
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.600]   just free associative writing,
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.800]   usually, as I understand with a writing utensil,
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.880]   it's probably better.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.600]   We did an episode where I talked about this
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.580]   and received a note from him
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:10.460]   and was grateful that we didn't get anything badly wrong.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.640]   In fact, he was pleased with it.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.560]   I think that he deserves a lot of credit.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.960]   - Well, we-- - A powerful tool
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.880]   for self-healing.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.880]   - We actually just restarted a prestigious speaker series
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.680]   at Michigan, the Katz Newcomb Speaker Series,
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.600]   which is designed to honor luminaries in the field.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.440]   And we actually kicked it off with Jamie
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.080]   coming to speak about his extraordinary work
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.840]   because this is really a gift, I think,
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.540]   not just to the field, but humanity.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:43.300]   And the but though here is that it's an effortful tool.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.760]   It takes 15 minutes to use.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.720]   There is nothing wrong with that.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.680]   Lots of things that we do in life are effortful,
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.920]   but we also know that we don't like exerting effort
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.760]   as a species.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.000]   We like to conserve our resources as much as possible.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.920]   So if there are easy things you could do as well,
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.880]   it's good to know about what those are.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.120]   And these sensory shifters, music,
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.320]   looking at images, right?
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.400]   These are modality, taste, touch.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.680]   These are ways of pushing your emotions around
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.280]   pretty effectively for short periods of time
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.080]   that in a pinch, like when your daughter's
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.600]   not in a great mood, or when you wanna get pumped up
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.880]   before an important event, can be quite useful.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.600]   And we often just go through our lives
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.580]   not recognizing how we can strategically harness them.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:39.320]   So that's my plug for sensory shifters.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.240]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.760]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.260]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.840]   that includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.400]   I've been drinking AG1 since 2012,
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.760]   and I started doing it at a time
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.480]   when my budget was really limited.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.120]   In fact, I only had enough money to purchase one supplement,
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.000]   and I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.800]   The reason for that is even though I strive
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.720]   to eat whole foods and unprocessed foods,
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.960]   it's very difficult to get enough vitamins and minerals,
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.080]   micronutrients, and adaptogens from diet alone
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.660]   in order to make sure that I'm at my best,
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.560]   meaning have enough energy for all the activities
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.800]   I participate in from morning until night,
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.480]   sleeping well at night, and keeping my immune system strong.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.720]   When I take AG1 daily, I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.120]   my physical health, my mental health, my performance,
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.880]   recovery from exercise, all of those improve.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.560]   And I know that because I've had lapses
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.920]   when I didn't take my AG1,
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.700]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.680]   I also noticed, and this makes perfect sense
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.600]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.440]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.440]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.940]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.320]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.920]   AG1 is giving away a free one-month supply
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.200]   of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.200]   in addition to their usual welcome kit
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.560]   of five free travel packs
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.480]   and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.040]   As I've discussed many times before on this podcast,
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.560]   omega-3 fatty acids are critical for brain health,
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.360]   mood, cognition, and more.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.600]   Again, go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.400]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.740]   Juve makes medical-grade red light therapy devices.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.580]   Now, if there's one thing
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.180]   that I've consistently emphasized on this podcast
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.360]   is the incredible impact that light can have on our biology.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.700]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.240]   red light and near-infrared light
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.680]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.980]   on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ health,
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.960]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.000]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.380]   improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation,
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.040]   improved mitochondrial function,
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.640]   and even improving vision itself.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.200]   Now, what sets Juve lights apart
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.820]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy devices
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.920]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.520]   meaning they use specific wavelengths of red light
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.740]   and near-infrared light in combination
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.500]   to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.560]   Personally, I use the Juve whole body panel
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.120]   about three to four times a week,
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.880]   and I use the Juve handheld light
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.880]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.120]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.720]   you can go to juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V, .com/huberman.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.640]   Juve is offering Black Friday discounts

[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.680]   Again, that's juve, J-O-O-V-V, .com/huberman
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.780]   to get up to $1,300 off select Juve products.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.940]   Let's go back to just close the loop
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.720]   on the inner voice and the benefits that it provides.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.400]   So we talked about two, verbal working memory, right?
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.080]   Keeping verbal information active for short periods of time.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.280]   And we talked about simulating and planning things,
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.800]   like going over what you're going to say
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   before an interview or an important presentation.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   Let's turn to self-control and motivation.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:02.320]   So you exercise, you've talked about exercising.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.440]   - I try to exercise six days a week,
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.080]   although some are short workouts, some are longer.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.760]   - You ever talk to yourself when you exercise?
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.840]   - Oh, all the time.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.880]   - So let's hear it.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.600]   The world wants to know, Andrew,
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.920]   what do you say to yourself when you exercise?
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   - Depends on how well-rested I am, how motivated I am.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.680]   I'll give two examples at the opposite poles
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.700]   of the motivational scale.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.600]   I was traveling two weeks ago
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.800]   and I was doing some exercise for the,
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.520]   there's a muscle on the back of the shoulder,
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.440]   the rear deltoid.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.520]   It's, I don't think anyone's favorite muscle to train,
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.560]   but it's a very important one for-
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.520]   - That's when you do this one.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.620]   - You're right, for shoulder posture and stability
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:46.500]   and got to train those, that muscle group,
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.400]   because otherwise people tend to get this inward rotating,
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.040]   like, you know, thumbs pointing toward belly button
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.460]   and shoulders rolling forward thing.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.880]   And there are a number of reasons why it's important.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.520]   So you got to do the rear delt thing.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.680]   And I sat down to do the first work set
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.280]   after a couple warmups.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.500]   And I remember thinking like, I love training.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.340]   I love training.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.240]   I have since I started training when I was 16.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.080]   And I thought to myself,
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.920]   for some reason I don't want to do this this morning.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.000]   And then I thought, okay, David Goggins
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.040]   would probably start swearing at himself in his head.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.800]   So I started that a little bit
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.960]   and that didn't really work for me.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.800]   Sorry, David.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.500]   And then I thought,
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.720]   I'm going to go through every possible inner voice
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.560]   I can think of.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.520]   So I heard Jocko Willink's voice.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.540]   I'm friends with Jocko and her just saying like,
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.260]   yeah, whatever, you're just weak, you know,
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.980]   or just like do it anyway kind of mentality.
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.940]   And I just started cycling through all of them.
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.980]   And I made a deal with myself
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.020]   that when I ran out of voices to use,
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.620]   that's when I would stop the set.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.840]   And I probably tripled the number of repetitions
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.640]   that I would normally get with that weight.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.480]   So it was like one part motivation, one part distraction,
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.960]   one part frustration.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.880]   And I was just pulling from the catalog of possible voices
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.880]   of kind of coach like voices and worked out pretty well.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.820]   And then at the other extreme,
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:04.480]   I can recall many times because I put effort into it
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.040]   where I'm well-rested, I'm hydrated,
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.440]   get appropriate amounts of caffeine in my system,
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.280]   which I love and sit down to train.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.680]   And I absolutely love to train under those conditions.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.600]   The sun is shining, music's playing.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.440]   And I just remember this was during a set,
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.400]   this was a leg day, always the hardest day,
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.640]   set of heavy hack squats.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.160]   And just thinking, I love this,
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.940]   but I have this inner voice where every time
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.600]   I start a repetition,
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.280]   I go through the thing where I brace my midsection
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.200]   so I don't hurt my back.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.600]   And I always look directly at the ceiling
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.840]   and I think about my bulldog Costello.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.000]   And I think, I'm gonna do this one for you.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.840]   I'm gonna do this one for you.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.080]   And I know at those moments, my inner voice goes to,
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.640]   he would probably just be sitting there like,
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.320]   why are you working this hard?
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.520]   Bulldogs don't like to work.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.360]   So I'm not really in a complete sentence generation,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.720]   inner voice kind of thing.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.560]   - But you have a very rich inner world, right?
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.560]   Your verbal working memory stream is filled with words
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.520]   when you are working out.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.760]   - Yeah, and I'll tell you this.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.440]   I was gonna ask you this later in the episode,
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.480]   but maybe it's relevant now.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.400]   I think it is.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.560]   When I was a kid, after my parents would tuck me in
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.560]   to go to sleep at night,
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.720]   I used to lie in bed and rehearse voices
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.680]   that I had heard throughout the day.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.800]   And I felt like I could hear them in their tone of voice.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.560]   And then I'd make them say different things
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.280]   just for my own entertainment.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.120]   So I could have them say whatever I wanted,
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.960]   but in a particular voice.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.120]   And my friends sometimes tease me
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.340]   that I'll give people voices.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.040]   Like I'll give someone like a Marge Simpson voice
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:36.880]   or something.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.040]   They're like, she doesn't sound like that at all,
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.600]   but I'll just sort of create a narrative in my mind.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.440]   So yeah, a lot of chatter in there, a lot of voices.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.280]   But not super organized.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.600]   It's not like I'm constructing a play.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.800]   It's kind of, it feels like things geyser up.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   I toy with them, maybe a little.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.920]   But it's kind of a mishmash.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.640]   It's not super regimented.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.840]   These aren't complete sentences.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.520]   - Well, one of the reasons why the Penny Baker effect
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.000]   is believed to be so useful
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.760]   is because it imposes a structure
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.380]   on the stream going through our head,
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.320]   which is oftentimes not organized.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.560]   And when you find that inner verbal stream
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.960]   going in the negative direction,
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.240]   so negative self-talk, so the chatter, right?
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.600]   You're an idiot, such an idiot,
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.960]   or you're looping over a problem
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.560]   without making any progress.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.560]   Putting those words in,
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.680]   actually taking that inner stream
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.280]   and making a story out of it
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.040]   is essentially what the Penny Baker writing cues you to do.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.480]   Because we are taught when we write,
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.720]   we write in sentences,
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.680]   there's a structure to our writing
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.040]   that we impose on our thinking.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.460]   Up here in our minds, it's a free-for-all.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.880]   It can go in all sorts of directions.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.220]   And that chaos is in part what can make chatter so aversive.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.120]   - I'm so glad you're bringing this up.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.600]   Our very first guest ever on this podcast
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.160]   was a guy named Karl Deisseroth.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.200]   He's a bioengineer, he's a practicing psychiatrist.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.720]   He's one of the luminaries of neuroscience.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.640]   He developed these light-sensitive channels
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.400]   to be able to manipulate neurons in animal models,
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.280]   but also now in human clinical work as well.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.200]   And one thing that he shared was that
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.000]   after he puts his kids to sleep,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   I think now they're grown,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.480]   but in the evening, he'll deliberately sit still,
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.120]   completely bodily still, close his eyes,
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.520]   and force himself to think in complete sentences
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.040]   for maybe an hour or so, maybe more.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:37.860]   And I thought to myself,
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.560]   "Wow, that's a very disciplined practice."
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.760]   It also speaks to what you're saying,
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.680]   which is that typically thinking in complete sentences
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.100]   is not the default of the mind.
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.340]   So I don't know what his specific reason for doing that is.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.620]   He shared a few of them on that podcast episode,
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.520]   but I'm sure there are others as well.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.640]   But I tried it.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.280]   It's very difficult, especially with eyes closed,
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.040]   to not drift into multiple narratives,
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.840]   the stream sort of split into your tributaries,
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.960]   and then you dissolve into sleep or-
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.800]   - A meditation experience.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.400]   - Yeah, an almost dream-like state
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.180]   where you're in these liminal states.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.020]   - Well, that's, I think,
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.860]   where the writing provides a tool
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.400]   to structure your thinking.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.080]   Talking has a similar modality.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.000]   So when we talk to people,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   there is a structure to the way we converse
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.880]   where we're not,
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.840]   if I were to just talk to you
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.720]   the way I pinball in my mind,
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.060]   you wouldn't be able to understand me,
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.720]   and you would think I'm out of my bleeping mind, right?
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.100]   Because I would be unable
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.780]   to have a meaningful conversation with you.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.180]   So there's some research which shows that
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.100]   if you get people to think of,
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.200]   to recall a chatter-provoking experience,
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.640]   so think about something negative that's happened to you,
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.240]   and then you randomly assign them to just think about it
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.320]   and work it through in their mind versus write about it,
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.940]   so i.e. a penny-baker writing-like condition,
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.280]   or talk about it to someone else,
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.280]   the talking and the writing both do better
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.920]   in terms of how they feel when they're done
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.800]   as compared to the just thinking,
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.360]   because there's no guardrails to the way we think.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.880]   That we are taught, I should add,
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.560]   because we're gonna give people guardrails
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.660]   later in this episode.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.080]   - So in addition to using the penny-baker approach,
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.320]   and by the way, we'll provide a link to some resources
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.880]   for the penny-baker journaling,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.560]   'cause there's some free online resources
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.260]   that I think are really powerful for people to use
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.120]   if they wanna use that as a template,
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.380]   for cathartic reasons,
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.920]   or just get one's mind around a problem,
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.120]   or something I'm very familiar with,
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.680]   waking up and just feeling like everything is kind of,
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.680]   not a storm in there,
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:51.040]   but a bit too disorganized to get my head right,
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.040]   you know, and so I need things to get my head right.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.440]   Sometimes it's music, sometimes it's writing.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.280]   It sounds like journaling
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.160]   is just a really useful practice overall.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.680]   - It's a useful practice,
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.180]   and it's an underutilized practice.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.400]   So we did two pretty large studies during COVID
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.320]   to look at how people,
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.180]   how are people regulating their emotions on a daily basis
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.280]   to deal with the anxiety surrounding COVID?
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.320]   And we gave them a series of tools
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.100]   that they could check off if they use the tools that day.
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.100]   And we learned a couple of really interesting things.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.160]   Number one, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.000]   for folks.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.200]   So remarkable variability characterized
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.080]   the tools that work for person A versus person B.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.640]   Number two, it was seldom the case
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.240]   that people used one tool.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.880]   In general, people used, on average,
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.220]   three or four tools each day,
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.720]   which I think is another really important take-home
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:49.460]   because I am often asked as, for example,
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:52.220]   what is my favorite tool for managing emotions?
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.220]   I don't have a favorite tool
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.300]   because I'm typically using multiple tools,
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.020]   and most people are doing exactly the same.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.700]   So it's kind of like what we're learning
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.900]   about emotion regulation is, in some ways,
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.700]   it's similar to physical exercise.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:10.740]   You're not only going to work out your rear deltoids
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.060]   with the same exercise every day.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.700]   You would have funky-looking shoulders if you did, right?
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.720]   You'd probably be pretty weak
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.440]   in lots of other parts of your body.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.720]   You're doing multiple things,
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.840]   and the multiple things that you do to exercise,
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.000]   I'm guessing, are different from the multiple things
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.360]   that I do to exercise,
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.940]   yet we may well be equally fit.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.800]   Well, you may be a little bit more fit than me,
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.160]   but you get the drift.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.560]   So there's this beautiful variability
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.440]   to how we manage our inner worlds.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.140]   To bring it back to expressive writing,
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.700]   we found that expressive writing,
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:49.480]   when people used it, was really, really useful.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.340]   It moved the needle on their COVID anxiety,
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.160]   but it was an underutilized tool.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.560]   People didn't do it very much,
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.560]   and I think that's in part because it is somewhat effortful.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.160]   - Let me ask another question about movement
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.960]   that falls on the other end of the spectrum
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.480]   to what we're talking about now,
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.560]   which is structuring one's thoughts in the form of writing
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.160]   in order to parse an idea
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.620]   or work through an emotional state.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.520]   In 2015, by the way, I use these anecdotes,
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.660]   not because I want to focus on me,
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:23.340]   but just as generalizable anecdotes, okay?
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.700]   The specifics here don't matter,
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.660]   but I think probably most people are familiar
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.780]   with having an important decision
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.940]   where they have to weigh path A versus path B.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.860]   And I was in that place.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.600]   I was actually choosing between a job
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.340]   at one institution and another institution,
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.500]   each of which had tremendous advantages,
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.980]   neither had any striking disadvantages,
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.780]   but it was a really hard decision.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:45.940]   And those close to me at that time
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:47.980]   will tell you that it was just brutal.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:48.820]   - Been there.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.740]   - Yeah, I made everybody around me suffer tremendously
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.580]   to the point where people were just like, "Flip a coin."
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.320]   Now, I'm not an indecisive person.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   I think it's one of these things where big decisions,
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.580]   I think, deserve time and attention,
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.860]   and it was a time-constrained thing.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.060]   So I was poring over this pro/cons list.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.420]   I was watching YouTube videos,
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.260]   trying to figure out best ways for decision-making.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.140]   I was trying to, I actually-
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.220]   - Isn't it amazing, by the way,
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.300]   when we're in those situations,
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.780]   and I know exactly what you're talking about
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.820]   because I was pretty sure I was in exactly
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.300]   the same position.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.900]   The things you do in those circumstances
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.620]   to get some insight are wacky.
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.180]   Like, I'm sure you were Googling things
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.200]   that you had no business Googling
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.780]   these kinds of decision trees and-
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:32.620]   - Oh, yeah. - Right?
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.440]   I mean, it's wild.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.740]   - It turns out they're mathematical models
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.920]   that, like, there's the,
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.500]   actually, my colleague at NYU, Tony Movshin,
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.540]   I forget the name of the model,
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.380]   but there's a model about how many towns
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.220]   you should evaluate.
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.300]   It's an old, kind of old example of towns
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.460]   you should evaluate in terms of where to start a business.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.740]   Like, is it two, is it three?
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.580]   And there's an optimal strategy there.
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.900]   In any event, most of it wasn't helping.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.220]   And I do believe that, at some point,
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.180]   you don't want too many committee members
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.500]   'cause it just gets confusing.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.960]   So the two best pieces of information
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.500]   came from the following practices.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.660]   One was a colleague said,
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.540]   "Forget all the superficial pro-con stuff."
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.300]   And I actually think this has proved to be very useful
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.380]   in all domains of life for me.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:20.820]   He said, "Take yourself through a typical weekday
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.200]   "in one place versus the other.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.360]   "Wake up, where are you going to go?
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.340]   "How are you going to travel?
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:26.720]   "Take yourself through the practicals of the day
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.280]   "because everything else falls away
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.620]   "once you're at a place
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.040]   "or you're in a type of relationship.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.340]   "Take yourself through a given day."
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:34.900]   Don't think about the relationship
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.860]   or the institution that you're going to work for,
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.340]   the school you're going to go to.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.980]   That's important, but take yourself through the entire day.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.240]   So I did that.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.660]   And then he said, "Also do it on a weekend."
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.300]   Because, you know, well, in our profession,
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.240]   we tend to work all the time,
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.020]   but occasionally you take a day off.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.380]   And so that was very useful.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.840]   The other thing that was very useful,
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.660]   which was completely surprising to me,
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:00.840]   was at that time I was training in a boxing gym
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.100]   and I was doing some speed bag work and decent at it.
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.620]   You know, you get into a rhythm.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.520]   And what's so great about speed bag work
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.620]   is that you get into a rhythm
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.220]   where you forget that you're trying to do the movement
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.060]   in a particular way.
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.920]   These central pattern generators,
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.940]   as we call them in neuroscience, take over.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.140]   And you're just kind of, you know,
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.400]   turning your hands over in a way.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.220]   And you're like, every once in a while,
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.060]   you can think, okay,
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.620]   you need to put a little more hip swivel into this
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.940]   or a little more head movement
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.280]   and practice my slips or something.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:32.040]   But it's largely unconscious after a certain point.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.060]   And I was doing that.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.340]   And all of a sudden, boom,
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.620]   a thought just geyser to the surface.
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.100]   And I made my decision.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.220]   And that was my final decision.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.940]   And I never went back from that decision.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.420]   And so it was in the act of not trying to parse things
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.700]   in words, that words sprung up from my whatever,
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.940]   unconscious somewhere in my brain,
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.020]   cortical or something, cortical, I don't know.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.980]   And it was like, that's it.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:59.740]   And I was overwhelmed by that.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:00.980]   And again, I don't share all that
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.340]   because I think it's speed bags
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.540]   or it's the example I gave before
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.820]   that's gonna solve it for everybody.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.460]   But that these answers to hard problems
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.580]   seem to come from very diametrically opposed approaches.
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.380]   Verbal construction of complete sentences with paper
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.140]   or deliberately like Dyseroth does.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.660]   And then also like not trying to get an answer at all.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:21.820]   Boom, the answer shows up.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.260]   What in the world is that?
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.620]   - So it speaks to this idea that first of all,
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.180]   there are no one size fits all solutions
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:32.060]   to addressing many of the big kinds of problems
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.700]   and decisions we have to face.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.960]   So there are different modalities
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.420]   to self-discovery and insight.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.580]   And yes, you can think very rationally
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:42.620]   and work it through and write about it
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.540]   and have conversations with other people.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:46.220]   And then you can also allow
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:51.220]   your unconscious problem solving machinery to do its thing.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.540]   We don't understand completely how this works,
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:59.540]   but we do know that your experience is not infrequent.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:03.380]   Many people report having moments of insight
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:07.340]   when they are not otherwise engaged.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.680]   And one line of thinking is that
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.300]   we are doing problem solving behind the scenes
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.340]   that we're not aware of
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.060]   and the solutions are bubbling up to awareness.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.420]   So I actually, this may be the wrong usage of terms,
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.880]   but I weaponize this process for myself.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:27.620]   So before I exercise, before I get on the treadmill or row
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:29.420]   or do whatever I'm gonna do,
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.880]   I will load up the particular issue
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.060]   that I'm trying to find a solution for.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.460]   Sometimes it's how to word a paragraph.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.300]   It might be if I'm working on a book,
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.680]   how to find the right kind of story.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.060]   If it's an interpersonal issue
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.880]   that I've got to smooth over, I load that up.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.540]   And then I just get on the device.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.920]   It's usually an aerobic exercise that I'm doing.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:59.300]   And I just, I don't really think about it in any fixed way,
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.840]   but inevitably the ideas,
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.720]   the potential solutions bubble up into awareness.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:10.320]   That is a real valuable tool that I possess
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.480]   that I think allows me to have success
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.100]   in various areas of my life.
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:20.660]   It also identifies one of the reasons why chatter
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:23.400]   can be so unbelievably pernicious.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.960]   So we didn't get to all the benefits of the,
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.280]   there's one more benefit of the inner voice
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.120]   that I wanna get to,
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.840]   but I'm gonna take a detour here for a second
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.880]   'cause I think this is really important.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.100]   If we think of chatter as the dark side of your inner voice,
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.820]   you're basically continuing to loop over
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:41.440]   the same problem in your head without making any progress.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.400]   What if this happens?
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.360]   Why did this happen?
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.400]   I'm such a imbecile.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.040]   You're just continually going over
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.200]   that negative phenomenon or experience.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.680]   You're not making any headway.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.380]   One of the things that that does
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:58.520]   is it consumes our attentional resources.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.840]   It acts like a sponge that soaks up those limited resources.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.600]   And so what that means
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.800]   is when I get on the treadmill or rowing machine,
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.280]   and that's typically the time that I spend innovating,
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.860]   right, coming up with solutions
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.620]   that allow me to progress personally and professionally,
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.840]   I don't have, my mind's not working to solve those problems.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.760]   Instead, it is stuck dealing with this other muck
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.600]   where I'm not getting anywhere.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.480]   And so we actually see, if you look at the literature,
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.520]   that one of the ways that chatter undermines people
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.960]   is it interferes with their ability
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.160]   to focus and solve problems.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.680]   And that's just one way it undermines people,
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.980]   but that is a huge, huge liability.
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:46.640]   - Is there an association between trauma
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.040]   and elevated levels of internal chatter?
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.840]   - I would say even more than an association.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.480]   So we often think of chatter
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:59.600]   as what we call it as a transdiagnostic mechanism.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.000]   So it's a mouthful
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.240]   that predicts various kinds of mood disorders.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.900]   So what that means is chatter refers to a process,
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.160]   a process of looping,
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.200]   turning the same material over and over in your head.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:17.200]   The content of that looping can take many different forms.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.840]   You could inject some sad cognitions in there.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.140]   I'm a shit, such a shit.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.280]   Is it okay to say shit?
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.120]   Should I say that?
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.080]   - Sure, people, I mean, David Goggins was on this podcast.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.680]   - Okay, so, you know.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:29.780]   - I mean, pretty much anything goes.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.440]   Typically, we don't swear at each other.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.640]   - Okay, well, I should hope not.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.780]   - I'm pretty thick-skinned if you need to, you know,
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.280]   I've been called way worse than anything.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.240]   - You've been boxing.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.800]   I actually boxed in high school.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.000]   - I don't recommend people box
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.360]   unless they're, you know, they're professional.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.320]   And even then, I mean, I must say, as a neuroscientist.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.160]   - It's a lot of fun.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.040]   - Yeah, and on Wednesday nights, I'd spar a little bit,
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.340]   but I will say this, it's,
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:55.640]   there are other sports where you can go level 10 out of 10.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.480]   - Yeah.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.840]   - More safely, much more safely for the brain,
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.440]   like Brazilian jiu-jitsu and things like that, you know.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.560]   - You typically don't want to insult the brain.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.320]   - Yeah, as a neuroscientist,
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.960]   I can't encourage people to box.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.440]   - I would agree.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.320]   In any case, I promise not to leap across the table
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.680]   if you do the same.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.520]   - Fair enough.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.360]   - Deal?
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.180]   - Deal.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.240]   - So basically, chatter refers to this process
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.880]   of looping over and over.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.240]   If you inject some sad cognitions in there,
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.760]   I'm an imbecile, how can I, you know,
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.940]   I'm never going to live up to my potential,
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.120]   I don't belong here.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.560]   Like, so then you get, if you take that to an extreme,
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:38.240]   high intensity, and you perseverate over time,
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.400]   then you're getting towards depression.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.000]   If you inject anxiety provoking cognitions,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.440]   oh my God, what if this happens?
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.360]   And what if that happens?
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:50.040]   And you go down that path of uncertainty and fear,
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.200]   well, that leads you to more of the anxious route.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:58.000]   And if you are filling that loop with traumatic memories
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.720]   and reminders of really painful experiences,
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.880]   you can get pushed towards trauma too.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:07.080]   So it is a process that cuts across many different,
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:11.000]   really serious conditions that we grapple with in society.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.340]   But I wanna also be clear to folks who are listening that,
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.720]   if you experience chatter,
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:20.520]   that does not mean you have any of those disorders.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.200]   If you experience chatter,
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.900]   welcome to the human condition, my friends,
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:27.160]   because most of us do at times.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:31.280]   And so we often don't experience it as intensely
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.000]   or for long stretches of time,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   which tends to characterize some of those clinical groups.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.680]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:41.380]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.000]   I recently became a Function member
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.280]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.320]   to lab testing.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.240]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.200]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.840]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.720]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.500]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.760]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:04.200]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.920]   Function not only provides testing
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:09.040]   of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health,
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.880]   but it also analyzes these results
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.440]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:17.300]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.420]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:21.720]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.520]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.400]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.880]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.560]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.880]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.640]   because I'd been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.000]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.900]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.960]   both of which can support glutathione production
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.720]   and detoxification, and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.280]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.700]   is so important for health,
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.480]   and while I've been doing it for years,
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.400]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.880]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.800]   both at the level of ease of use,
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.320]   that is getting the test done,
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.880]   as well as how comprehensive
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.400]   and how actionable the tests are,
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.640]   that I recently joined their advisory board,
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.880]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.200]   If you'd like to try Function,
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.480]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.080]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.680]   but they're offering early access
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.920]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:22.200]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.160]   to get early access to Function.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.280]   If you had to highlight for now,
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.360]   and we'll get back to others in a moment,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.280]   the best maybe one or two ways to combat chatter,
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.460]   what would those be?
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:41.200]   - Well, let me tell you about a couple of things
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.280]   that I do personally,
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:46.640]   because as we try to regulate
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.560]   lots of different emotional experiences,
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.200]   different tools work for different people
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.520]   in different situations.
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:55.200]   There are upwards of two dozen or more
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.560]   science-based tools that I covered when I wrote "Chatter,"
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.400]   when I got into "Shift," the broader train
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.660]   of regulating your emotions,
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:05.080]   there are even more tools out there.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.500]   So I don't wanna presume that the tools that work for me
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:09.900]   are gonna work for everyone.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:14.960]   My first line of defense when it comes to chatter
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.920]   are two distancing tools.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:19.320]   So when I'm using the term distancing,
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.140]   what I'm talking about is not avoidance per se.
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.060]   We should talk about avoidance later.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.560]   But what I'm talking about when I say distancing
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.240]   is the ability to step back
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.640]   and view myself from a slightly more objective perspective.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.940]   And it turns out there are many different tactics
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.400]   that exist for doing this.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:42.000]   One tactic that I find very powerful is language.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   So I can manipulate the words I use to refer to myself.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.200]   So I will often use my name
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.680]   and the second person pronoun you
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:51.680]   to try to think through a problem.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:55.040]   Ethan, how are you gonna manage this situation?
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.000]   If you think about when we use words like you,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.840]   they are the verbal equivalent
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:03.880]   of pointing a finger at someone else.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:07.680]   And when you use your name and you to work through a problem,
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.640]   it's automatically switching your perspective.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.520]   It's getting you to relate to yourself,
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.320]   like you're giving advice to someone else.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:18.060]   And it turns out that's a really powerful tool
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.880]   because one of the things we know about human beings
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.760]   is we are much better at giving advice to others
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.520]   than we are taking that advice ourselves.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.120]   Have you ever experienced this, Andrew?
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:28.940]   - Gosh, no.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:29.780]   Yes, of course.
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:32.240]   Absolutely.
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:35.800]   I mean, our optics are just much clearer
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.840]   when we're in observation than when we're internally,
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:44.840]   unless I find that I dedicate some real minutes or hours,
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:49.440]   basically a sort of meditation,
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.680]   not unlike the complete sentence construction exploration
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:54.480]   that we were talking about before of just going inward
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.680]   and really saying, okay,
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.120]   let's have a conversation about this, Andrew,
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.920]   and having a conversation with myself in there.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.840]   And that always leads to an obvious truth
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:08.480]   or sometimes a decision node that isn't clear to me yet,
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.200]   but it leads someplace that feels like forward.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.040]   - Yeah.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:16.000]   But you're taking special steps
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.520]   to be able to align yourself
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.240]   with the advice that you would give to someone else,
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:24.640]   like reflexively sometimes we stumble, right?
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.520]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.560]   I mean, and the number of different ways
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.840]   that we can distract ourselves,
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.200]   this is what I was gonna ask in a few moments,
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.760]   but I'll take the opportunity now.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:36.400]   I am wondering, as we're talking about this today,
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.320]   if one of the more powerful hooks of social media
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:46.320]   is the scroll aspect that with essentially zero effort,
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.800]   we can pick up a device and scroll through images
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.080]   and movies and it will update us according to,
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.480]   update the imagery and topics, of course,
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.960]   according to what it senses as our dwell times
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.040]   on certain pages.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.760]   And all of a sudden we don't have to think
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.360]   about what's in our head.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.880]   My dad used to refer to surfing the internet,
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.880]   'cause at that time it was that,
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.040]   and scrolling social media
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.560]   as kind of a cognitive chewing gum.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.800]   It keeps us busy, but it doesn't provide any real nutrition.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.600]   - Well, it's interesting if you go back
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.240]   to when Facebook first came on the scene,
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.080]   one of the early prompts that it would use
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.440]   to get people to contribute textual information to,
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.160]   do you remember what this was?
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.160]   What is on your mind?
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.640]   So you would be cued to share what is on your mind.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   And in some ways you could think of various forms
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.800]   of social media as providing people with a giant megaphone
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.920]   for their inner voice.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.800]   It is literally asking you where it did,
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.280]   what is on your mind right now?
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.640]   - So that's in terms of posting.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.840]   - Posting, exactly. - Like what's on your mind.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.720]   But in terms of consuming information,
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.520]   which I think most people on social media
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.520]   seem to be consumers more than creators.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:06.720]   I mean, it's remarkable to me how I can pick up the phone
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.520]   and I have a specific phone with Instagram and X on it,
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.040]   and those apps are not on any other phones,
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.440]   so that it's segregated from.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.280]   - Yeah, smart.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.920]   - If somebody sends me a tweet
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.000]   or sends me an Instagram post on,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.520]   I'm not gonna open it, I can't open it on those phones.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.360]   - Right.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.180]   - And that's helped a lot.
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.020]   - We should come back to that
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:26.160]   because that's also modifying your spaces,
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:30.200]   which is another tool that I think is underutilized.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.840]   So we should talk about that too.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.040]   - We'll definitely touch on that.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.440]   What I find is, I'll say, okay,
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.920]   I'm gonna take six minutes.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.880]   It's six minutes till the hour, take six minutes.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.720]   - Yeah.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.680]   - And what's incredible is how fast six minutes
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.840]   seems to go by. - Oh.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.960]   - That's what's so striking.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.240]   - It's remarkable and not always bad.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.280]   So we often talk about social media
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.920]   like it is a de facto harm to society.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.720]   There are negative features of social media
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.680]   that are well-documented.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.000]   There are also some, I would argue,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.240]   redemptive qualities to it.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.300]   I'll give you one of my personal ones,
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:10.240]   which is sometimes like to unwind before bed,
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.360]   I'm thinking all day,
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.400]   I wanna just watch some ridiculously funny short reels.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.480]   - Yeah, raccoon videos.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.360]   - Yeah, I mean, my wife looks over at me,
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.040]   she's like, what are you laughing at?
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.200]   And then I sometimes I show her and she goes,
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.320]   why are you laughing at that?
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.240]   But the algorithm has learned
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.120]   the specific kinds of funny videos that I like
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.280]   and no, I'm not gonna tell you what they are.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.160]   And it just lightens the load.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.800]   And so that's a way that I'm using social media
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.920]   very strategically to shift my emotions in a direction
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.520]   I want them to be shifted at a certain time.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.280]   I think when we talk about social media
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.320]   and our emotional lives,
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.920]   the real challenge we face is how to learn,
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   how to navigate these new digital environments
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.880]   in ways that serve us rather than serve against us
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.360]   and undermine our goals.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.140]   We basically got thrown into social media
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.600]   without any rule book.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.680]   - Yeah, we're the experiment.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.960]   - We're the experiment.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.880]   But if you think about it, it's a new environment.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.840]   We were born into this physical world
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.080]   and our parents, our caretakers,
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.520]   from the time we're able to understand things
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.080]   and probably before, they're teaching us,
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.720]   they're socializing us
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.160]   how to navigate this space profitably.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.640]   They don't just like Lord of the flies,
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.280]   throw us into the world and let us kind of figure it out.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.100]   Outcomes wouldn't be likely as good as they are for us
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.880]   if we didn't have the kind of instruction that we receive.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:45.920]   And we're only now developing that knowledge base
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.000]   to understand, hey, here are the healthy
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.760]   versus harmful versus benign ways
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.160]   of navigating social media.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.640]   And I'm talking about social media now,
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.320]   like it's this unitary environment.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.100]   Different social media applications, of course,
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.320]   have their own norms and rules of the games.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.400]   You could think of them as like little different countries.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.000]   They have their own little microcultures
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.860]   that you want to learn how to navigate.
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:13.220]   And scientists are really busy trying to understand
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:16.000]   how they function, but it's tricky.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.900]   And it's tricky because creators can change
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:25.460]   how these applications govern by a press of a button, right?
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.060]   You could change the way the algorithm works
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:29.500]   and then you've got to start over to some extent.
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   - I've been told that by people in my life
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.460]   that one of the main reasons they get onto their phone
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:38.400]   in the middle of the night if they happen to wake up
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:43.400]   is that it allows a very soothing distraction
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.320]   compared to trying to wrestle with the fire hose
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.040]   of thoughts in their head.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.200]   And that, yeah, it's kind of like the way you describe
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.680]   these funny videos that you won't disclose to us.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.840]   That sounds like, you know...
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.680]   - They typically involve pranks.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.480]   - Oh, okay, noted.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.460]   We used to hear that people would have a drink after work
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.380]   to just kind of take the edge off or something like that.
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:12.300]   I feel like social media is doing that for a lot of people.
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.420]   The way you describe it fits with that idea.
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:17.340]   And I certainly believe that from everything we know
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.020]   about the circadian health literature
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.780]   that you want to avoid looking at your phone
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.940]   between the hours of 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.820]   most nights, nobody's perfect.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.260]   But that if you wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.020]   one of the worst things you can do is get on your phone
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.300]   and start scrolling social media.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:35.440]   But I'm guessing people do it because it feels even worse
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.720]   to just sit there with your thoughts in the dark.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.480]   - It's a shifter, but this is a perfect segue back to,
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.960]   you know, you asked me about the tools
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.480]   that you recommend for fighting chatter,
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.840]   and I'm telling you about the ones I use.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.800]   So there's a second tool that I will use automatically
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.920]   when I detect the chatter brewing.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.200]   And I call it my 2 a.m. chatter strategy.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.960]   And I call it my 2 a.m. chatter strategy
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.340]   because every seemingly like four to six weeks,
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.540]   I will go to bed happy and content.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.940]   And then I'll wake up at 2 a.m.
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:11.420]   and like, it is all going to hell really fast.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.740]   - What time do you typically go to sleep?
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.620]   - Usually around 11, 11.30.
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:17.460]   - Interesting.
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.660]   Yeah, this is a common problem for a lot of people.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.100]   And there are some tools like long exhale breathing
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.580]   and things that clearly work.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.140]   I long ago made a decision.
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:29.600]   I refuse to believe any thought that occurs
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.960]   between the hours of 2 a.m. and 5 a.m.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.920]   I just refuse.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.800]   I don't believe it.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.360]   It's as if somebody is lying to me in my head.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.200]   And one could argue,
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.560]   well, maybe that's where the truth is coming out
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.320]   because your forebrain is not so good
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.360]   at suppressing these, you know, unconscious thoughts.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.640]   And sure, all good, but as you point out,
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.520]   they are rarely the kind of thoughts
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.960]   that one can work with, positive or negative.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.960]   So the tool that I use actually implicitly activates
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:58.500]   an idea like the one you are describing.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.020]   So at 2 a.m. when the chatter strikes,
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.940]   and by the way, you say like, oh, this is common.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:04.980]   This is more than common.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.140]   When I present to audiences and, you know,
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.100]   thousands and thousands of people over the years,
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:13.540]   and I ask, "Hey, you ever get 2 a.m. chatter?
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.480]   "Maybe 2.30 a.m."
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.580]   All the hands go up.
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:20.500]   This is, I don't want to say universal affliction,
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.440]   but it is an incredibly common problem
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.980]   that people struggle with, like the chatter at night.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:30.080]   So what I do is I use something called mental time travel,
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.500]   mental time travel into the future.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.060]   And what I do is I ask myself,
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.640]   and I typically use my own name to do it.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:39.220]   So I'm blending another distancing tool,
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.060]   distance self-talk.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:41.380]   I say, "Ethan, how are you gonna feel
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.260]   "about this tomorrow morning?"
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:47.340]   No matter how bad the chatter ever is at 2 a.m.,
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:50.100]   to your point, when I wake up the next morning
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:53.260]   and my brain is fully, fully awake,
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.820]   and I have access to my prefrontal cortex,
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:58.440]   and I can think constructively about things,
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.500]   it is never as bad that next morning
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.340]   as it is in the middle of the night.
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:08.140]   We, of course, have learned that over time
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:13.140]   because how many mornings have we woken up in our lives?
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.020]   We could do the math.
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.800]   If I was more sophisticated, I'd do it on the fly.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.700]   I can't, right?
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.940]   But like many, many mornings, we've experienced this.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:24.520]   Like, chatter at 2 a.m., at 7 a.m., not so bad.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.980]   So when you jump into this mental time travel machine
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:27.980]   and you ask yourself,
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.940]   "How am I gonna feel about this tomorrow morning,
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:33.300]   "next week, next year, 10 years from now?"
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:37.460]   What that does is it activates this understanding
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:40.980]   that what you are going through, as bad as it may seem,
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.460]   it is temporary, it will eventually subside.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.220]   And that does something very powerful
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.820]   for a mind that is consumed with chatter.
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.580]   It turns the volume down on it,
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:52.340]   which for me is often all I have to do to get back to bed.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.820]   So the official name for this tool
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.100]   is not mental time travel.
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:57.780]   It is called temporal distancing.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:59.740]   And it's a flexible tool.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.220]   You can ask yourself, if you're struggling with a problem,
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.840]   "How are you gonna feel about it tomorrow,
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.140]   "next week, 10 years from now?"
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:10.180]   And it's another way of broadening your perspective.
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.420]   It's another kind of distancing tool
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:14.540]   that has a lot of science behind it.
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:18.600]   So those are the two of the cognitive things
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.220]   that I do on my own.
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:24.580]   And that nips a significant chunk of the chatter
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.060]   that I experience in the bud when it happens.
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:31.660]   And I should add that because I know about what chatter is,
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:34.260]   and I know about how these tools work,
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:38.020]   I am exceptionally strategic in utilizing those tools
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.060]   the moment I detect the chatter brewing.
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:41.660]   So people will often ask,
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.420]   "Hey, do you ever experience chatter?"
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.300]   I'm like, "Yeah, of course, pinch me.
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:49.220]   "I'm a living, breathing human being, I do at times."
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.340]   But I'm really good at detecting it
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.780]   and then implementing tools in an almost automatic manner.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.620]   If this happens, if the chatter strikes,
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.260]   then I'm gonna coach myself through the problem
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:00.700]   using my own name and you,
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.220]   and I'm gonna jump into the mental time travel machine
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.060]   and ask myself,
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:06.260]   "How am I gonna feel about this in the future?"
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.900]   If that's not sufficient,
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.980]   then I'll go to like the level two response,
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:14.060]   which consists of, if weather permits,
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:17.420]   I'll go for a walk in a safe, natural setting.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.980]   I always feel the need to give the caveat
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.140]   about safe and natural,
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:23.540]   because where I grew up in Brooklyn,
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.220]   like the natural settings were the place you got mugged,
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:27.940]   so they were not safe.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:30.580]   But a park, I find restorative,
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:31.940]   and there's a ton of work
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.700]   highlighting the restorative features of green spaces.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.140]   But then what I'll also do
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:43.020]   is I'll dial up the chatter advisory board.
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.900]   So I have a couple of people
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:48.660]   that I have carefully thought about
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:53.780]   what these people do for me when I have a problem.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.560]   And they, importantly, don't just let me vent my emotions,
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.940]   or cathect, to use that term before,
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:01.540]   just, I don't just get it out.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:03.580]   A lot of people think that the key to feeling better
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.460]   is to vent your emotions.
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.840]   There's research on this.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.660]   Venting is good for strengthening bonds between people.
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.500]   It's good to know that, you know,
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.740]   we're buddies now, I could call you up if I'm struggling,
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.500]   you're gonna listen to me and empathize with me,
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.160]   that's great for our relationship.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:23.220]   But if all you do is just validate what I'm going through,
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.780]   and you don't take the next step
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:28.020]   to additionally help me look at that bigger picture
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.540]   and problem solve,
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.960]   I leave the conversation feeling really good
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.140]   about my relationship with you,
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.060]   but the problem is still there.
[01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.100]   So just venting ends up leading
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:38.720]   to what we call co-rumination,
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.160]   which can be pretty harmful.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.020]   The people on my chatter advisory board,
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.880]   they know to first validate, empathize with me,
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.660]   learn about what I'm going through.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.080]   They've got my back, they communicate that powerfully.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.420]   But then once they do that,
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.260]   they start working with me to broaden the perspective,
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:57.540]   to try to think through that problem,
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.140]   which I'm having difficulty doing sometimes
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:03.260]   when the chatter is really, really loud.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:06.060]   And, you know, typically when I get to that stage,
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.300]   I'm in pretty good shape.
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:13.040]   - I love your examples of how you deal with chatter.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.760]   Your example of going to sleep,
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.400]   and the reason I asked when you go to sleep
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.600]   at about 11 p.m. and waking up at two or three,
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.840]   and that being a very common issue,
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.280]   is as far as I understand,
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.280]   reflective of the fact that early in the night,
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.640]   our sleep is dominated by slow wave deep sleep
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.960]   with less rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.040]   And then somewhere right about that transition time,
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.440]   it's not necessarily two or 3 a.m. per se,
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.660]   but given that you were asleep for about three, four hours,
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.980]   after about three, four hours of sleep,
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:45.620]   the proportion of our sleep that is rapid eye movement sleep
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:48.680]   relative to deep slow wave sleep shifts dramatically.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:51.300]   The intensity of our dreams shifts dramatically.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.220]   They become more emotionally laden.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:56.860]   And that whole process of having those rapid eye movement
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:00.420]   sleep associated dreams is strongly associated
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.600]   with the removal of an emotional load
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.780]   in the morning when we wake.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.820]   We know this because if you selectively deprive people
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.780]   of early night versus late night sleep and so on.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:11.100]   The reason I mentioned this is that one tool
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:15.020]   that I certainly have found useful is that,
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.920]   well, two tools really.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.180]   If people just understand that one of the reasons
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:21.840]   they'll wake up suddenly at two or 3 a.m.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.660]   is that they're undergoing this transition
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:27.240]   from kind of one form of sleep to another,
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.220]   it's almost like a different beast altogether.
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:34.300]   And that heart racing, emotionally laden thoughts
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.700]   is characteristic of where they're supposed to be
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.420]   in the sleep architecture cycle.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.380]   And so for me, so that's number one.
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.140]   The other is that the tool that you provided
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:46.420]   of getting into this mental time travel,
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.500]   I'd like to just double click on this notion
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.340]   of time perception.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:53.560]   In sleep and dreaming, I mean, time is very fluid.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.100]   You can be one environment than another.
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:55.980]   It seems compressed.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:58.080]   A lot happens in a short amount of time.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.060]   When we are in chatter in the daytime,
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:04.820]   to what extent does it alter our perception of time?
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:07.300]   And I have a very specific reason for asking this
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:12.300]   because I believe that one of the main unifying features
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.220]   among the tools for dealing with depression, anxiety,
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:17.140]   et cetera, when I survey the research
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.860]   is almost all of them, journaling, meditation,
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.060]   even some of the medications for that matter
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.300]   involve taking people into a different
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.820]   sort of time perception mode.
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.560]   And it's a kind of an abstract idea,
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.180]   but I think this may resonate
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:34.300]   with some of the issues related to chatter,
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.260]   that when we're in a mental frame
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:39.220]   that's not healthy for where we wanna be at that moment,
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.580]   awake when we need to sleep,
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:42.820]   anxious when we wanna be calm and so forth,
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:46.260]   that changing our time perception
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.980]   seems to be the most useful thing that we can do,
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.580]   or at least among the most useful.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.500]   So what's the relationship
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.260]   between chatter and time perception?
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:56.300]   - Tell me more about what you mean by time perception.
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.980]   - How broadly or finely we are bending time.
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:02.080]   So we know that as autonomic arousal, let's call it stress,
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.360]   but wakefulness and autonomic arousal goes up,
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:05.840]   we're fine slicing time.
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.320]   In fact, the pupils get bigger.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.760]   We actually see depth of field changes.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.120]   We get higher resolution image of much less.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.520]   This is, it makes every bit of evolutionary sense.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.280]   We can deal with fewer things better.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.120]   And typically it's the thing
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.940]   that we're fixated or ruminating on.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:20.880]   When we're relaxed,
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.320]   think about like sitting back on a beach
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.740]   and you're watching the clouds go by,
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:28.280]   it's almost like your frame rate is slower.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.000]   So your higher frame rate is like slow motion.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.800]   This is why people who experienced trauma
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.000]   often feel like things are, or a car crash,
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.080]   like see it in slow motion, or it's not in slow motion,
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.920]   you're fine slicing time.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.520]   It's kind of a remarkable thing, right?
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.880]   This is also how athletes learn to play
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.120]   with their levels of autonomic arousal.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.080]   Fighters can see punches coming in
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.560]   and it's almost like slow motion,
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.080]   but they can react with full speed.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.740]   Likewise with tennis players, we'll describe this.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.740]   So what we're talking about is dynamically changing
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.000]   the frame rate of one's experience.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.560]   - It's a very interesting question.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.720]   And there's not much data that I'm aware of
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.560]   directly linking chatter with these,
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.840]   with time perception, the way you're describing it.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:09.180]   But what does come to mind are our experiences of flow,
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:11.920]   which in many ways you might consider
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.080]   the opposite of chatter.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:16.900]   Flow being this state where, you know,
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:21.960]   you're just in the moment and time is effortlessly passing.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.820]   The demands of the situation completely match
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.560]   the skills that you bring to bear.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.800]   It almost seems like the antithesis
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.640]   of what you're describing.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.960]   When I think about time and chatter,
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.060]   what becomes most accessible for me
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:40.280]   is this tendency that we have to really zoom in very narrowly
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.400]   on the object of the chatter,
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.800]   on the thing that is causing that distress.
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.400]   And we focus, you know, so narrowly on it,
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.380]   which of course makes a great deal of sense,
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.360]   because what are we taught to do
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.200]   from the time we're little kids when we have a problem?
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.880]   - Think about it, share it.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:58.840]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:02.320]   You got it on try number one, zoom in, focus on the problem,
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.360]   roll up your sleeves and get to the bottom of it.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.620]   And so that's that kind of really,
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:09.280]   you're getting in there in fine grain detail.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.240]   And, you know, that does work for us a lot of the time,
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.200]   but it turns out when you inject a lot of emotion
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.680]   into the equation, that can get really troubling.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.920]   And that's where this zooming out,
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.720]   taking this broader view,
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.720]   whether you do that through visual modalities,
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.840]   imagination modalities, like mental time travel.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.640]   You could time travel into the future,
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.880]   like I've just described.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.720]   You can also go back in time.
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.840]   Like I do this quite a bit,
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.940]   when I'm struggling with some kind of adversity,
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.760]   I will go back in time and think of another experience
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:43.440]   in my life or someone else's life that I know of,
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.320]   when times were even worse and they got through it.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.120]   And, oh, if I got through that,
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:51.340]   well, sure as heck I can get through this.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:55.680]   And so that's expanding our perception of time,
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.200]   or looking at that bigger picture
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:01.520]   to work through something in the present moment.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.720]   - How often do you think people,
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.240]   and I do believe this is related to chatter,
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:08.700]   but if it's not, we can set this aside for another day.
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:13.700]   How often do you think people are in kind of negative
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.600]   or positive fantasy?
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.480]   Like as they move through their day,
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.960]   I'm sure a study has been done asking people
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.920]   what they're thinking about.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.960]   I mean, how often is it actually tied to what they're doing
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.900]   or they're supposed to be doing?
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.680]   Or are they thinking about like
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:26.640]   what they're gonna do this weekend?
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.720]   Or maybe even constructing entire narratives
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.280]   of things that are like non-existent
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.440]   that they would like to exist.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.600]   Or occasionally we'll see this person,
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.000]   I think we've all seen this person
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.520]   kind of mumbling to themselves,
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.160]   and it doesn't look like they're mumbling pleasant things.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.760]   - Yeah, it's because they've just been rejected
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.080]   by a journal editor, their article.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.200]   - The experience of every scientist.
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.400]   And it's of course always reviewer number two's fault.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.940]   They didn't read the paper carefully enough, of course.
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:54.080]   And none of us have ever been reviewer number two.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.340]   I'm being sarcastic by the way,
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.800]   we've all been reviewer number two.
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.260]   Little academic inside ball humor there.
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:04.600]   You know, you'll see somebody mumbling to themselves.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.800]   And it doesn't look like they're mumbling pleasant things.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.380]   We don't know what they're saying to themselves,
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:11.080]   but I'm guessing that if we tapped them and said,
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.080]   "Hey, what were you mumbling?"
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.380]   I would guess that more than 50% of the time
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.880]   it was kind of frustration with stuff.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.840]   You kind of see this like the frustrated person.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.120]   It's a hard thing to observe actually.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.760]   - Yeah, so people have looked at this.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.860]   And my memory of this wonderful paper,
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:28.800]   I think it was published in Science.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.280]   I think the title was,
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.620]   "A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind."
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:37.840]   And basically the take home from the article
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.940]   was that people spend between,
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:42.880]   well, if you look at this paper and lots of others like it,
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.080]   what we can deduce is that people spend
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.000]   between 1/2 and 1/3 of their waking hours
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.720]   not focused on the present.
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.440]   So between 1/2 and 1/3 of the time we're drifting away
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.000]   and we're thinking about other things.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.760]   And this one particular paper linked that process
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:00.680]   with thinking about things that cause you to feel worse.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.520]   I think there's huge levels of variability there though.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:07.000]   I think like being lost in thought
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.160]   can be a wonderful experience.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.200]   I love, love, love, love mind wandering.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.840]   I think it's one of my strengths.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.840]   It is the source of idea generation for me.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:19.120]   It is also the source of emotion regulation.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:23.280]   I will, one of, you know, my sleeping pill,
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:27.940]   metaphorically speaking, is mental time travel.
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:29.200]   It's getting away from the present.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.260]   It is fantasizing about the future, right?
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.480]   Thinking about the good things that could happen,
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.560]   the potentialities, or going into the past
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.360]   and savoring some of the positive things that happen.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.280]   I'm thinking about, you know, the soccer game
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.640]   where my kids scored goals
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.920]   or something good happened to someone I know or to me.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:53.800]   And that to me is a wonderful way of going to bed.
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.760]   That is mental time travel.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.660]   It is not being in the moment,
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:00.560]   which actually raises another really important point
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.440]   that I wanna get in there.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.080]   And I'd love to get your take on this
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.540]   because in popular culture,
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:08.460]   we often hear that it's really important
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:09.720]   to be in the moment.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.360]   This has emerged as a type of cultural maxim,
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.400]   like be in the now.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:17.880]   And this idea is often conveyed so strongly
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.800]   that if you're not in the moment,
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:23.320]   we sometimes think there's something wrong with us.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.240]   Like, oh, we gotta train our attention
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.160]   to bring it back to the present.
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:32.280]   Being in the present can be very useful in many contexts.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.440]   And certainly when we experience chatter,
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.680]   we start worrying about the future
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:37.400]   or ruminating about the past,
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.240]   refocusing on the present or breath, a mantra.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:43.720]   Yes, lots of data support the utility of that.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:46.080]   But I always like to remind people
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:50.360]   that the human mind evolved to be able to travel in time.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.700]   And lots of amazing things accompany that process.
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.560]   If I can't go into the past,
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.720]   not only am I not savoring positive experiences,
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:02.360]   which add joy and vitality to my life,
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.260]   I'm also not learning from my screw ups,
[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:07.720]   which sadly happened to me on a somewhat regular basis.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.680]   Right, I'm learning from my mistakes
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.080]   by revisiting the past.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.600]   And if I'm not going into the future,
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.080]   then I'm not planning, I'm not simulating,
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.920]   I'm not fantasizing.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.520]   So we wanna be,
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.140]   we don't wanna shut down mental time travel.
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.960]   I think what we wanna learn how to do
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:30.280]   is how to travel in time in our minds more effectively
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:34.160]   without that time travel machine breaking down in the past,
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.840]   which is what happens when we get stuck on an experience
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:39.480]   or in the future when we just find ourselves fixating
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.540]   on something that we're anxious about.
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.640]   So being in the moment can be good,
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.000]   but it is not the endpoint I think
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.700]   we always want to strive for.
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:54.240]   - To what extent do you think that texting and smartphones,
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:59.240]   but namely texting has interfered with sort of time tested,
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:04.080]   meaning over hundreds of thousands of years,
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:08.160]   time-tested mechanisms for us to process our emotions
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.160]   and our thoughts to arrive at better ways
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.020]   of thinking, feeling, being.
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:16.940]   Nowadays, if you get on a train or a plane
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:19.420]   or you're in an Uber or you're walking to your car
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:21.600]   and you have a thought about something,
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:22.800]   oh, that grant that idea,
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:27.720]   it's so easy to just get into a mode of texting.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.000]   Passive participation,
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.120]   maybe through social media scrolling,
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.660]   again, not universally bad,
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:34.300]   but you can go to passive kind of
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:36.040]   almost semi-dissociative state.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.080]   Like they're not really in the parking lot anymore.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.040]   You're half in your phone and half in the parking lot.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.120]   And texting, polling people around you,
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.920]   as opposed to quote unquote in the old days
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.800]   where you had to actually grapple through this stuff.
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:51.360]   As you describe the tools that you use
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.820]   to deal with chatter and to process information
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.780]   and to work with your thinking and your emotions,
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:00.520]   you strike me as somebody who has a rich jungle gym
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.720]   of things to play with in there
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:06.500]   and a toolkit and an emergency switch if you need it
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.080]   and all that stuff.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:13.080]   Whereas most people, I think, just, they have their phone.
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.280]   Who are you gonna call?
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.240]   Who are you gonna text?
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:18.200]   What site are you gonna Google the Google search to?
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.400]   I mean, it can't be good.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:27.880]   - Well, it often isn't, but it can be harnessed.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.560]   And here's what the way I think about texting
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:34.280]   and really how social media and the opportunities
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:37.920]   it gives us to communicate with others whenever we want,
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.040]   how this has thrown a curve ball
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.300]   into the way we manage our own emotions
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:45.460]   and sometimes inadvertently affect the emotions
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:46.940]   of not just other people,
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:50.240]   but groups of people and societies.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.600]   So when we experience emotions,
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.960]   we are often intensely motivated
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.360]   to share those experiences with others.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.760]   There's this wonderful research program
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.520]   by a Belgium psychologist by the name of Bernard Rimet
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:05.520]   who spent his whole life looking at
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:07.720]   what do you do when you experience emotions?
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.440]   And he found over many decades of work
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.240]   that you're motivated to verbalize it, to get it out.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.440]   And there are a couple of reasons for that.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:18.680]   We wanna relate to other people, get their support,
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.520]   but we also wanna usually process it.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.880]   In the pre-social media era,
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.320]   two things had to happen typically to share our emotions.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:34.280]   First, you had to find someone to share them with.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.360]   And typically in the process of looking for someone,
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.480]   either to find someone face-to-face or via phone,
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:41.640]   time would pass.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:46.640]   Now, what we know about time is that as time proceeds,
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.320]   our emotions in general tend to fade.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.920]   So there's this wonderful work
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.120]   on the duration of emotional experiences
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.800]   and our emotional experiences
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.280]   all follow a common trajectory.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.720]   So something happens in the world or in our mind,
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:03.160]   we imagine something that is provoking in some way,
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.600]   our emotions get triggered.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:08.280]   And then as time goes on, they eventually peter out.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.920]   And depending on who the person is
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.420]   and what they're dealing with,
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:15.120]   some people may peak more intensely than others
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.800]   and fade more quickly.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.920]   Some maybe have shallower peaks and take longer to subside,
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:24.000]   but they all follow that basic trajectory over time.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.500]   So let's go back to the pre-social media era, right?
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:30.800]   So you gotta find someone to talk to.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.460]   And while you're trying to find someone to talk to,
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:37.120]   time is passing, that's acting to temper our emotions.
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.040]   Now, once you find someone to talk to,
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.920]   either face-to-face or via phone,
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:43.880]   the moment you start talking,
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.760]   you are now awash in all of this feedback,
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.360]   this emotional feedback,
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.640]   whether it's coming from your face,
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:53.240]   like you're giving me all sorts of information right now.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.360]   I would benefit from smiling if you could.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.600]   There we go, thank you.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.720]   I'm just joking for those who are listening,
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.460]   but I'm getting information from you.
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.160]   And if I'm talking to someone on the phone,
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.800]   likewise, I'm getting,
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.600]   their vocal tone is expressing to me how they feel.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:10.040]   That is also working to constrain
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.340]   how we communicate with others.
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:14.840]   And it's typically keeping our emotions, I would argue,
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.960]   in check and balance and proportion.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.240]   We're stripping away time with social media,
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.240]   and we're also stripping away
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.420]   that kind of emotional feedback.
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:28.760]   This enables us to release our emotions
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.920]   in a much more unfiltered way.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.400]   And I think this is why you often have situations
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:39.400]   that people are saying things via text or online
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.640]   that they would never say to another person's face
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:43.920]   or over the phone.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.600]   And I think this is one of the factors
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.720]   that can promote some pretty negative forces in society.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:54.520]   So cyberbullying and the spread of moral outrage
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.860]   surrounding certain issues
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:59.720]   that might take a more constructive form
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.360]   if they were done in a different context.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:06.500]   Now, that is not to say that social media isn't useful
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:09.540]   for spreading certain kinds of messages
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:11.940]   that require attention
[01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:15.120]   and are deserving of collective distress.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.680]   It can be an amazingly useful tool
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.960]   that brings about needed change.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.820]   But I think we do need to be conscious
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:25.980]   of how interacting with this technology
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:28.500]   has really fundamentally altered
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.700]   the way we communicate emotional information.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:35.620]   - When I think about the different ways to parse a problem,
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:37.560]   a real or imagined problem,
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.240]   and I think about the role of web searches,
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.100]   it immediately takes me to either social media
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.060]   or to, I don't know, it could be Reddit,
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:49.060]   could be some article that was written
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:50.900]   and posted online in 2019.
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:52.220]   You know, these will resurface.
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:53.860]   They repurpose these things all the time.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:55.140]   I don't know why they do that.
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:56.560]   - I just got emailed this morning
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.340]   about an interview to a fact check that I did in 2019.
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:02.180]   You go figure.
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:04.300]   - I mean, it's cool that there's, I guess,
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.140]   that there's archival material on the internet
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.340]   that not everything is fleeting.
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:11.420]   Certainly in the podcast space,
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:13.420]   we like to think that the information on this podcast
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:16.820]   will archival, and we can update it over time.
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:21.380]   And that actually brings me to the very specific question,
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:23.220]   which is about AI.
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:24.500]   You know, with AI,
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:28.360]   web searches are now changing fundamentally.
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.180]   You're no longer being brought to a site
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:32.380]   that is just a designated site.
[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:33.580]   You're getting information back
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:37.100]   that's the amalgam of a lot of information.
[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:38.620]   Funneled through, presumably,
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:40.540]   the large language models are changing all the time,
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:43.820]   but funneled through kind of your search behavior,
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:45.060]   your preferences, et cetera.
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.980]   So web searches are no longer
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:50.800]   just site destination journeys.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.280]   They are, you know, recipes of information
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:59.420]   that are filtered and combined and given back to us,
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:02.260]   which makes me think that maybe AI can provide
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:05.180]   a kind of pseudo self that is wiser
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.660]   than ourselves in any moment,
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:09.780]   or potentially wiser than we are in any moment,
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.260]   because it can access information
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:14.140]   that is not dependent on like bodily state shifts.
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:17.260]   Like at 2.30 in the morning, 3.30 in the morning,
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:18.900]   a small problem can seem huge,
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.340]   and a huge problem can seem absolutely overwhelming,
[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:23.460]   just crushing us.
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.380]   At 7 a.m., it's different.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:27.060]   When we search on the web now,
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:29.960]   like how to get through bankruptcy,
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.900]   let's say somebody is dealing with bankruptcy,
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.620]   there's information to go to,
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:36.740]   but with AI, it can give you the information in the form
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:39.780]   and from the sources that are most meaningful to you.
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:43.060]   And it doesn't, even if it's 2.30 in the morning for you,
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:45.820]   the AI is fresh, it doesn't need to sleep.
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:48.220]   That seems to me like a distinct advantage
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:49.500]   over our own minds.
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.300]   And I know AI is controversial.
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:52.500]   Is it going to get smarter than us?
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.940]   Is it going to tell us to go do bad things,
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.760]   this kind of thing?
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.420]   Okay, that's a whole different discussion.
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:58.820]   But it seems to me that AI could be pretty good,
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:01.500]   maybe even terrific at helping us resolve problems
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.940]   because it doesn't have these state shifts,
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.020]   and it's really tailored to us.
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.460]   - Well, it can be.
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.860]   And I think AI, I think of it as a new tool
[01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:13.360]   that has amazing potential.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:16.300]   And I actually think it has the potential
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:19.060]   to help us advance on a problem
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:21.820]   where psychologists like myself
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:24.900]   currently find ourselves fixed.
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:29.220]   So if I look back at the last 20, 30 years of research
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:30.860]   on emotion regulation,
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:32.820]   I'm talking here not just about managing chatter,
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:36.380]   but managing the whole suite of unwanted emotional states
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:38.620]   that we might encounter in our lives.
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:43.380]   What I can do is I can point to several individual tools
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:46.620]   that are empirically supported, science-based tools.
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:49.340]   And scientists have done a really good job
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:53.120]   profiling how these individual tools work mechanistically.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:56.060]   They've often gone down to the brain level.
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:57.820]   They've looked at them in intervention context
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:59.180]   and everything in between.
[01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:02.600]   So we have a pretty good sense of how individual tools work.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:06.400]   But what we are now learning is individual tools
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.080]   are not the name of the game
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:10.220]   because we are often doing multiple things
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:11.780]   to manage our emotions.
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:16.060]   And the combinations of tools we use within people,
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:18.060]   they often vary across situations
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:21.140]   in ways that we don't completely understand.
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:23.820]   And there's variability between people as well.
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:26.540]   So the blends or cocktails of tools
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:30.460]   that are most beneficial to us remain to be illuminated.
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:31.980]   So if someone comes to me with a problem,
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:34.940]   I can go through all the tools in the toolbox.
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:38.340]   What I can't do is I can't prescribe combinations of tools
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:40.500]   and say, "Hey, for the kinds of problems
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.300]   that you are experiencing and the kind of person
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:45.360]   that you are, here are the four things that you should do,
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.420]   but that person over there,
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:48.280]   they should do these six things."
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:52.400]   I think AI has the potential with the right inputs
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.660]   to help us learn about those patterns
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:59.780]   that explain how to optimize emotion regulation
[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:01.280]   on an individual basis.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:05.500]   And that is a remarkably tantalizing possibility
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:06.660]   for that technology.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.380]   - You mentioned you have kids.
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:10.640]   - Yeah.
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.820]   - When my sister, who's three years older than I am,
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:16.860]   was a kid, my dad tells the story
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:21.020]   that she had an imaginary friend, Larry.
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:23.820]   Larry was a girl, lived in a purple house.
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:25.060]   This imaginary friend, Larry,
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:30.060]   had all the components of a child's mind
[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:34.100]   that was unrestricted by all the barriers of naming
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:35.200]   and things like that.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:39.020]   And my dad said that my sister used to play with Larry
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:41.920]   in her room for hours, just talking to Larry
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.920]   and with her doll houses and her toys
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.760]   and her things and doing.
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.640]   And then one day, my dad, he loves this story.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.160]   I don't know why he loves this story in particular,
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:51.680]   but he was standing outside her door
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.140]   and she was playing with Larry,
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:55.260]   her imaginary friend, talking to Larry.
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:57.940]   And then she stopped and turned around and he said,
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.240]   "How's Larry?"
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.760]   And she said, "Larry's dead."
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.640]   And she never talked about Larry again.
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.080]   Like it was this sort of collision
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.360]   between fantasy life and real world,
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.740]   this is how I interpret it, and that was it.
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:11.760]   Larry was done.
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:12.840]   - Yeah, poor Larry.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.660]   - Poor Larry.
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:15.000]   Well, maybe it was time.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.040]   I mean, she was maybe gonna be seven soon
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.040]   and maybe it served her well.
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.040]   So I've always wanted to ask somebody this question.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.440]   I think you are the person to ask this question.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:26.500]   Are imaginary friends common in children?
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:31.500]   And are imaginary friends the primordial form
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:34.720]   of our internal dialogue with ourself?
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.100]   I'm just fascinated by it.
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:39.980]   And are there some adults who maintain imaginary friends?
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:42.540]   And I'll set an additional context,
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:43.940]   which will be especially relevant
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:45.220]   to the listeners of this podcast,
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:48.020]   which was in the very seat that you're sitting
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.280]   about this time last year, David Goggins was here
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:52.820]   and he was talking about how he pushes himself
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:54.100]   through tremendously hard things.
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:55.460]   And during that discussion,
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:59.100]   it became very clear that David has an array
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.260]   of different voices that are all him,
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:03.320]   but that serve different roles.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:06.380]   And it was a remarkable thing to hear him articulate that
[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:08.740]   because to those of us on the outside,
[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:10.220]   we observe it as like one person,
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:13.000]   but he's constructed an elaborate inner world
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.620]   to be able to equip himself to do the things he does.
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:16.860]   And I just have to wonder whether or not
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:18.260]   this whole thing of imaginary friends,
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:19.260]   provided it doesn't take us
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.500]   into the realm of psychosis and delusion,
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:22.560]   could actually be useful.
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.400]   - Yeah.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.760]   Isn't it remarkable that this is such
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.560]   a common human experience?
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.780]   And for most people,
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:31.800]   they never talk about this with anyone else
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.080]   because this is such a private experience.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.760]   So I often start presentations with a quote
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:40.160]   from Raphael Nadal, the tennis great,
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:42.400]   him answering a question about what's the hardest thing
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:43.240]   that he struggles with.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:47.120]   And he says, "It's managing the voices, plural, in my head."
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.240]   And I go to the audience and I say,
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.840]   "Hey, what do you do if someone comes up to you at a party
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.080]   and says they're struggling
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.960]   with the voices inside their head?"
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:56.800]   Right?
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.820]   Like, that is typically warning sign, right?
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:04.040]   That maybe something is awry here and someone needs support.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.240]   Yet, this is a very common feature of the human experience
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.360]   that we just never really touch on.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.260]   So to answer your question,
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:13.560]   is it common for kids to have imaginary friends
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.060]   and maybe talk to themselves?
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:15.900]   Yes.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:19.260]   I believe this is called the study of pretense.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:23.960]   According to one famous Soviet psychologist
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.840]   named Lev Vygotsky,
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:29.400]   one of the ways self-control is first learned
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.520]   is actually through self-talk.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.200]   And so what happens is you as a child
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.760]   will hear your parents telling you to do things.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.760]   "Andrew, you should do this," or, "Don't do that,"
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:42.840]   and, "Sit this way and not that way."
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:46.320]   And then what children will often do is go off on their own
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:50.520]   and they will repeat those kinds of messages out loud
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:51.360]   to themselves.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.600]   And so if you've ever been around young kids,
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:55.480]   you've probably seen them talking out loud to themselves
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:56.960]   or playing with dolls.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:00.440]   "No, Jimmy shouldn't do this, Jimmy should do that."
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.520]   Some kids do it in the form not of with an actual toy,
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.840]   but they have an imaginary friend in their mind
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:09.040]   that they are engaging with these different interactions.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.840]   And what the kids are doing in those contexts,
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.240]   according to this idea,
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.440]   is they're practicing self-control.
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.220]   They are repeating the things,
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:22.800]   the messages that their caretakers have told to them, right?
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.920]   They are reinforcing it in those ways.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.320]   And then as time goes on,
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.640]   and your sister demonstrated this,
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.200]   that outer voice becomes our inner voice.
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.960]   And we have the capacity to recruit that inner voice
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.340]   then throughout our lives.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:40.560]   But it is interesting that during moments of extreme stress,
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:43.080]   many people sometimes report
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:46.320]   actually talking to themselves out loud, right?
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.680]   And there's very little research on this,
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.120]   and a lot of this is anecdotal.
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.480]   But I have, when speaking to a lot of individuals,
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:55.640]   they say, "Yeah, sometimes I will actually just start
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.680]   "talking to myself out loud,
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.360]   "and I thought something was wrong with me,
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.200]   "and it's always what I'm struggling with,"
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.320]   like a major stressor.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:05.200]   So if we go back to reviewer number two, right,
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.840]   in the academic world,
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:10.040]   I remember once I wrote this invited article,
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:14.240]   and a reviewer did not say very nice things to me
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.560]   in this response.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.720]   And I remember just walking,
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:20.760]   I was, it was so offensive.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.660]   I remember walking around the neighborhood,
[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:25.220]   and I said, "Why don't you say that to my face?"
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:27.880]   You know, and I was just repeating what they said,
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.000]   and I was rehearsing it.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.360]   I was getting more and more upset,
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.380]   and then ultimately working through it.
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:36.680]   But it almost seems like in real moments of stress,
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:41.380]   we revert back to this very primordial way
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:42.680]   of regulating ourselves
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:45.600]   that we first exercised when we were kids,
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.200]   which is this self-talk.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:50.880]   And so David has become exceptionally skilled
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:53.640]   at harnessing different voices, according to you,
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.440]   to manage the challenges that he is facing.
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.920]   I've heard David talk on a number of occasions,
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:02.160]   and I think there is another important point
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:04.400]   to bring up here, which is,
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.480]   I'm pretty sure that when David
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.360]   is activating different voices,
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:11.080]   they are not always a very gentle voice
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.160]   that is encouraging him to take it easy
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:15.900]   and be kind to oneself.
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:17.920]   Sometimes, yes.
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:20.760]   And sometimes, this is important,
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:24.960]   because negative self-talk is often equated
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:28.000]   with harmful outcomes.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.920]   Negative emotions are functional
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:32.640]   when they are activated in the right proportions.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.280]   Sometimes being firm with yourself can be quite effective.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.520]   So if I go to when I'm exercising,
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:40.480]   and I'm doing classes sometimes
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:43.320]   where coaches are telling me to do really painful things,
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.840]   like sometimes I'm pretty tough on myself.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:48.040]   I'm channeling my high school wrestling coach
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.000]   who is really hard on me, right?
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000]   You better shape up, you can't wimp out here.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.280]   That serves a motivating function for me there.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.440]   So if we're recruiting some negative voices,
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:05.400]   that isn't bad per se.
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.600]   What is bad is if we start looping.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:11.040]   That is what we really wanna equate with chatter.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.920]   It's getting stuck in those thought loops.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:15.480]   That's when things get harmful,
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:18.240]   when those negative emotions are tweaked too intensely
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:19.160]   or for too long.
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.720]   - A couple of times, we've talked about the relationship
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.260]   between physical activities and mental activities,
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:30.540]   in particular, taking a walk, going into green spaces.
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:33.420]   And I was delighted to hear when you said
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:35.380]   that there's a vast literature
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:39.620]   supporting the use of green spaces for calming ourselves.
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:41.520]   Is that essentially what the data show?
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.240]   - Well, it goes a little bit beyond even just calming.
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:47.120]   So yes, there is data linking,
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.500]   going for a walk in a beautiful setting with feeling better.
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:55.760]   But scientists have actually gone even deeper
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:58.440]   to understand the various mechanisms
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.800]   through which interacting with green spaces
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.800]   and other kinds of environments can help us.
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:06.600]   And so there are two major pathways
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:07.680]   that I often talk about.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.400]   One is interacting with a green space
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.680]   can be cognitively restorative.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.280]   So as we talked about earlier,
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:17.080]   when people get stuck experiencing chatter
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.160]   or other kinds of big emotions,
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:22.600]   our attention often fixates on the problem at hand.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:25.320]   We focus really hard in trying to work through the problem
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:29.520]   and that can drain us of our precious attentional resources.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:32.660]   Well, when you go for a walk in a safe, natural setting,
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:37.220]   you're surrounded by interesting cues
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:40.680]   that capture your attention in a very gentle way.
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:45.120]   So I'm talking about the flowers and the trees,
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:46.760]   the scents, the sounds.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.720]   Our attention often drifts
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:51.080]   onto those features of our environment.
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.800]   Now, most of us are not doing the equivalent
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:56.320]   of carrying a magnifying glass
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.600]   and studying the geometrical structure
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.640]   of the leaves and the flowers, right?
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:02.600]   We're just kind of taking it in.
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.120]   But the surroundings are sufficiently intriguing
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.460]   to capture, to grasp our attention.
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:11.180]   And that gives us this opportunity
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:14.160]   to restore that precious commodity.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:16.480]   So there's work, there's a lot of work showing that
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:19.120]   going for a walk in a safe, natural setting
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:21.480]   can be cognitively restorative.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:24.160]   That's another feature that,
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.720]   or another mechanism through which
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.800]   nature exposure can help us.
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.920]   The other pathway that I just find so,
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:34.900]   it's so cool from a research point of view.
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.520]   Going for walks in natural settings
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.200]   often elicit the emotion of awe,
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.900]   which is an emotion we experience
[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:44.480]   when we're in the presence of something vast
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.680]   and indescribable.
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:47.520]   Something that just feels bigger than ourselves.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.740]   So in the arboretum near my house,
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:52.040]   there are these trees that have been there
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:53.160]   for hundreds of years.
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:55.360]   And you look up at these trees and you think,
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.640]   my God, like you've been there way longer than me
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:00.720]   and my parents and my grandparents,
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.200]   and you probably will be there longer
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.160]   than all of my progeny.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:07.660]   It's like, wow, that just broadens my perspective.
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:09.540]   Or an amazing sunset.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.900]   You can also experience this emotion
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:14.220]   through feats of innovation.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:19.060]   So I'm a science geek, I guess you could say.
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:22.580]   And for me, the two biggest awe triggers
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:26.840]   are number one, the images of the galaxy
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:28.860]   that the latest telescope produces,
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:30.740]   which if you follow this,
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:33.500]   maybe some physicists have somehow figured out,
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.740]   engineers, how to take pictures
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:40.240]   of what the universe looked like billions of years ago.
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.180]   Somehow, I don't understand the physics,
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:44.380]   we can see what it looked like
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:47.900]   this vast amounts of time ago.
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:49.700]   And we also, of course, have the equivalent
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:52.660]   of an SUV currently roaming on Mars,
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:55.700]   sending us back footage of that planet.
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:57.680]   So when I think of that,
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.060]   like we've actually landed a vehicle on another planet,
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:06.700]   this vastly expands, like I am filled with awe.
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:09.340]   So when we are experiencing something vast
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:11.300]   and indescribable like that,
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:14.040]   this is the ultimate perspective broadener.
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:16.340]   So it leads to what we call shrinking of the self.
[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:18.620]   We feel smaller when we're contemplating
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:21.380]   something vast and indescribable.
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:24.260]   And when we feel smaller, guess what else feels smaller?
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:25.080]   Problems.
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:25.920]   Our problems.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:30.920]   So this is an easy way of utilizing the world around you
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:34.360]   to powerfully manage your emotions.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:37.040]   And so what I love about that work
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.480]   is it highlights the fact that there are tools
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.480]   that are just hidden in plain sight.
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.120]   They're waiting to be harnessed.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.400]   And if you know where to look, you can often find them.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.080]   And that nature, by the way,
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.360]   isn't the only set of environmental tools that exist.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.200]   There are lots of ways that you can interact
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.320]   with your environment strategically
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.920]   to help you feel better.
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:00.000]   We often develop attachments to places, for example.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.880]   So you're probably familiar
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.720]   with the concept of attachment figures.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:08.080]   So there are these figures from our childhood
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:12.720]   that we often, though not always, securely attach to.
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:15.920]   They are a source of safety and comfort,
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:19.080]   and they serve a powerful regulatory role
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.880]   in our lives and our partners.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:24.800]   If we're in positive relationships, as I am, love you.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:29.040]   As to my wife, she is an attachment figure for me.
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:32.600]   Well, we also develop these associations with places.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.120]   And so sometimes places
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:37.380]   can be the source of safety and comfort.
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:41.140]   Going back to those places during times of distress
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:43.380]   can be really rejuvenating.
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:48.200]   I know one person who discovered that
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.800]   there was infidelity in his relationship.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.160]   And what really helped him get a grip on the situation
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.360]   was going back to his childhood home
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.800]   and sleeping in his bedroom at home.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.400]   That was the turning point
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:09.400]   that allowed him to reroute his ability to navigate his life.
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.720]   That's an example of the power of places to affect us.
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.360]   So how many times do we think about,
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:21.360]   hey, what are the places that are my emotional oases,
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.900]   if you will, that I can go to when I need it?
[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:26.960]   We can also structure our environments.
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.400]   Like you and I are both talking right now
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:31.640]   across the table from one another.
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.800]   We don't have our cell phones out on the table.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:35.640]   - No, not for me, not even in the room.
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.240]   - Not in the room for me either.
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:40.160]   If we did, and we had it facing up,
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.040]   we would be distracted, but would we not?
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:42.880]   Without question.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:43.700]   - Even facing down,
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.120]   I think there's some literature on this, right?
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:45.960]   - Still a cue.
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.280]   It's still an emotional cue.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.760]   - There's a cognitive tether.
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:52.680]   Because the thing signals a particular--
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:53.520]   - Reward.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:58.160]   - A particular reward and a particular set of behaviors.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.980]   Just like a pen, there are only a few things you can,
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.520]   I mean, there are probably many things you can do with a pen,
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.640]   but typically one.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.320]   - This is not John Wick here.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.760]   This is one thing that we're talking about.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:10.560]   - We're not getting innovative here with these objects.
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.600]   But right, when the phone is present,
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.600]   even if it's faced down,
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:20.600]   it cues the opportunity to make a call, receive a text,
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.240]   look on social media, scroll the internet,
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:24.400]   and find out what's happened.
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.760]   - And so by leaving our phones outside of this space,
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.280]   we are managing our emotions
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:32.320]   in a very blunt and effective way.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.060]   When laptop screens are open in my seminars,
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:38.120]   I know that I've already lost the battle
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:42.720]   because I know the object, the stimulus is so tempting.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:45.360]   Even if I'm the most captivating professor in the world,
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.600]   which I am not, I aspire to be captivating,
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.720]   but I know that I'm always going to lose
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.520]   compared to the screen, the email.
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:55.360]   - Do you ask them to close the laptop?
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:57.760]   - I ask them to, yeah, no laptops in my class.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:59.640]   - Wow, how is that received?
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.160]   - So far, so good.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.960]   You know, I explain to them,
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:05.280]   I actually explain to them the science behind this.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.640]   I explain why I'm doing this.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:09.600]   And I say that, hey, if I have my laptop open
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:13.360]   and I'm in your shoes, this is a divided attention task.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:16.920]   I'm not able to focus as well as if I don't have it open.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.560]   And in the courses that I teach,
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:21.240]   it's more about discussion and thinking through things.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.220]   So they don't really have a need to type notes for exams,
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:27.160]   which I think makes it easier for me.
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:31.200]   But modifying our spaces really strategically,
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:36.200]   like this is another valuable tool in our toolbox.
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:38.740]   Like when we have people over
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:41.360]   for football watching parties, let's say,
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:43.880]   it's pretty common where I come from in Ann Arbor.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:47.240]   And my favorite food in the world is pizza.
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:50.360]   And we have this wonderful New York City style pizza place
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:51.640]   in Ann Arbor now.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:55.560]   I will order vast amounts of it, much more than we need.
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:58.780]   And when the game is over,
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:02.120]   I will insist that everyone take it with them.
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.880]   Because I know if it is in the refrigerator
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.700]   and I open the refrigerator later that night
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:10.840]   to just get some water, if I see the pizza box, the queue,
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:13.920]   it will elicit a emotional response,
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:17.760]   this desire, this appetitive response to consume the pizza,
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:19.880]   which is not the goal that I have
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:22.140]   from either in a fitness
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:23.960]   or emotion regulatory point of view.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.360]   So I am structuring my spaces strategically all the time
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:31.760]   to give me the best chance of being successful
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.120]   at meeting my regulatory goals.
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:37.160]   - I'm so glad you brought up pizza and New York pizza
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.280]   and the fact that you're from New York.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.400]   Here's why, and again, I give a personal example
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:47.720]   only as a template for people to think about themselves.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:48.560]   - Sure.
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.560]   - Either where it matches or doesn't match
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.080]   what I'm about to ask.
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.440]   I love being in nature.
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:56.080]   I love being up in Yosemite and rural areas and at the coast.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.000]   I just love being in nature and the quiet of nature.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:05.000]   I find my mind slows and my thoughts and my emotions
[01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:08.980]   enter a pace that just is very soothing.
[01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:12.100]   I also love being in New York City.
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:13.280]   I was first in New York City
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:14.660]   when I was about five or six years old.
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:15.700]   And I remember telling my dad,
[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.300]   who's from another big city, Buenos Aires,
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:18.340]   I remember telling him like,
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:19.900]   I can't believe this exists.
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:20.900]   Like, can we come back here?
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:23.660]   And I swore that I would go back as many times
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:24.620]   as I possibly could.
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:26.180]   And I love going to New York City,
[01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:27.880]   despite it having many problems,
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:30.060]   it's still a wonderful city.
[01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:32.100]   When I'm in New York, there's tons of activity.
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.540]   There's tons of stimuli.
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:34.620]   - Yeah.
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:38.780]   - And I also find that my mind achieves that slowed pace.
[01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:41.100]   Another parallel construction here,
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:44.060]   and then I'll wage the specific question.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:46.300]   I've worked with professors.
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:47.980]   My postdoc advisor, for instance,
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:52.980]   and my graduate advisor worked extremely effectively.
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:54.700]   These are hyper-focused.
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:55.980]   Unfortunately, both of them have passed,
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:59.660]   but hyper-focused, brilliant people, truly brilliant.
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:03.740]   And their offices were a complete disaster.
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:06.420]   And we'd say, "Ben, you need to clean your office."
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:08.180]   And he would say, "No, no, no, don't move anything.
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:09.580]   "Otherwise, I won't know where anything is."
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:10.900]   And I'm like, "How can you know where anything is?"
[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:14.660]   Like this, it looks like an earthquake hit yesterday.
[01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:17.120]   And he goes, "Don't touch anything."
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.780]   And he could find things
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:22.500]   in this like dizzyingly messy environment.
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:25.100]   As somebody, he was the stereotype of the professor
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:28.340]   sitting hunched over at his keyboard at two in the morning.
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:29.500]   'Cause at that time I worked really late.
[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.260]   You'd go into Ben's office, he'd be like, "Hey."
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:35.740]   And he organized thinking amidst chaos.
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:38.580]   And the New York example would be the parallel.
[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:39.500]   And at the other extreme,
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:42.200]   nature also seems to bring this about.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:45.180]   So two specific questions.
[01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:47.880]   Is there a continuum of, let's say daytime,
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:48.980]   let's forget about middle of the night,
[01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:53.300]   of daytime kind of default levels of chatter?
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:55.340]   I think of this as kind of RPM in a car.
[01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:56.860]   Like how is the car idling?
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:58.100]   Like when you turn on the car and you just sit there,
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:59.540]   like if the transmission's working well
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:01.100]   and everything's working well, it's like.
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:01.940]   - Yeah.
[01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:03.700]   - Hums at a nice, it's not red lining.
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:04.540]   - Yeah.
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:06.740]   - Some people seem to be red lining all the time.
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:07.580]   - Yeah.
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:10.780]   - And they calm down in cluttered environments.
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:15.980]   So how much is, do we have a kind of a set point,
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:17.820]   a chatter set point?
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:18.900]   Assuming everything else equal,
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:20.980]   well-rested, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:23.700]   And then why is it that external environment
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:26.100]   matching our internal chatter
[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:31.060]   somehow like can adjust that internal set point, it seems.
[01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:32.900]   I realize this is very abstract,
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:35.140]   but for me, it's very useful to think about
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:37.700]   where my mind goes into its most pleasant
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.660]   and effective states.
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:39.500]   - Yeah.
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:43.080]   Your example of your advisors resonates
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.700]   so strongly with myself.
[01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:46.020]   - Is your office a mess?
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:49.860]   - Well, it entirely depends on my mental state.
[01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:53.100]   And prior to really getting involved in this space,
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:57.620]   I had no insight into why sometimes my office
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:52:59.220]   was a total mess.
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:01.780]   And sometimes it is spick and span,
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:03.740]   unbelievably organized and clean.
[01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:07.180]   And so let me share with you
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.340]   some of the research in the space,
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:11.320]   'cause I think it'll bear on this question you're asking.
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:13.260]   A lot of people find that
[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:15.580]   when they are experiencing chatter,
[01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:19.540]   they reflexively start organizing their spaces.
[01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:22.140]   So I'm a great example of this.
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:24.500]   My entire life, if we called my mother up right now,
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:25.460]   please let's not do it.
[01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:28.340]   But if we did, she could attest to the fact
[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:32.660]   that there would always be a trail of towels and clothing
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:36.320]   from the bathroom to my bedroom and all over the place.
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:40.660]   And my office is similar, piles of papers and books.
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:43.460]   And that's when life is good.
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:47.340]   I'm kind of free flowing, I'm getting in there,
[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:49.900]   I'm being creative, I'm generating ideas,
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:51.980]   and I'm not really worried about everything around me.
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:54.620]   In fact, I'm really good at typically
[01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:56.980]   like tuning out my surroundings
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:53:58.820]   to focus in on the task at hand.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:00.740]   I can work in a coffee shop,
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:02.960]   I can work almost anywhere and I love it.
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:06.180]   When I'm experiencing chatter though,
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:09.260]   and this is true from the time I was little,
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:11.180]   I would always start putting things away.
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:12.820]   I would always start organizing things,
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:14.880]   making them nice and tidy.
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:18.340]   My office is always spotless.
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:20.980]   Sometimes I even take it further presently
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:23.100]   when I'm experiencing chatter, I clean up my office,
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:24.060]   then I go into the kitchen
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:25.940]   and I make sure that's nice and tidy.
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:28.780]   And if it's really bad, like I'll clean up my kids' rooms
[01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:29.820]   and things like that.
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:32.760]   This is a very common experience.
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.380]   When you're experiencing chatter,
[01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:37.220]   you don't feel like you are in control.
[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:38.740]   You're not in the driver's seat.
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:40.880]   The thoughts and feelings are taking over
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.460]   and they're pushing you in directions
[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:45.140]   and to places that you don't wanna be.
[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:46.460]   It's an aversive state
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:50.220]   and it's chronically activated for a lot of people.
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:55.220]   Human beings in general, we crave control.
[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:58.580]   We like to know that the world is orderly and predictable.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:00.540]   There's some survival value
[01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:02.180]   that that communicates to us, right?
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:04.380]   If we know things are certain
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:07.920]   and proceeding in a predictable way.
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:12.640]   Creating order around us compensates
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:15.540]   for the lack of order and control we feel inside.
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:18.500]   It's called compensatory control.
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:20.860]   And this is the explanation that is often provided
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:25.820]   for why so many of us augment our spaces
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:29.660]   to counteract in this case, our emotional state.
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:33.100]   And so I don't know if that perfectly answers your question,
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:35.520]   but it for me highlights the way
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:40.020]   that we are tightly tethered to our surroundings
[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:42.200]   in some circumstances.
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:44.700]   When I'm not experiencing chatter,
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:47.900]   it really doesn't matter if the place is nice
[01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:51.460]   and tidy versus not, like no big deal.
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:54.660]   But when I'm motivated to think, feel
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:56.460]   and behave in a particular way,
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:59.860]   then my circumstances are becoming more important.
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:02.760]   - I mean, the military is a very salient example
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:07.100]   where people have to have their kit in order
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:13.380]   in order to essentially be able to proceed with the job.
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:16.060]   And people can say what they will about the military,
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:18.540]   but the structure and the hierarchy of the military
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:22.180]   is provided a structure and an order for people
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:25.660]   to essentially harness it,
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:29.700]   take go from a chaotic life to a structured life.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:30.540]   - That's right.
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:34.140]   - And it's an extreme example,
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:38.460]   but having everything squared away is one of those things.
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:41.020]   I got certified to scuba dive a few years ago,
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:44.820]   and it occurred to me early on in the first dives
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:48.380]   that if your kit isn't squared away
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:50.500]   and you don't have everything worked out,
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:51.900]   things can go badly wrong.
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:55.860]   And the severity of the potential consequences
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:58.020]   or the potential severity of the consequences,
[01:56:58.020 --> 01:56:59.820]   I suppose is the right way to say it,
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:04.260]   is a good reminder to have everything in check.
[01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:06.740]   This isn't the kind of thing where you can afford
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:10.580]   to forget a piece of gear or to not check a valve
[01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:14.300]   or it's potentially life or death.
[01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:17.060]   And that serves an adaptive role.
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:19.620]   It's kind of nice to have an activity, actually,
[01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:21.140]   where that's the case.
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:22.300]   Whereas we get into our cars
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:23.420]   and we might pull out of the driveway
[01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:24.260]   and then go down the street.
[01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:26.180]   And now you see people texting and driving all the time,
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:28.180]   or hopefully less as time goes on.
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:31.020]   And then you might put on your seatbelt
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:32.860]   like a quarter mile down the road.
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:33.920]   You might put it on first, right?
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:36.620]   I always put mine on first when I remember.
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:38.420]   I'm sure now someone will catch me with my seatbelt off,
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:42.900]   but I drive with a seatbelt and so on and so on.
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:46.900]   The physical steps that we take to organize ourselves
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:50.620]   and the environment and our relationship to the environment
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:54.540]   really do seem to change our brain into a different brain
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:56.220]   than were we to not do those things.
[01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:59.180]   - The way I carve up the emotion regulation space
[01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:02.980]   is there are multiple shifters that exist.
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:05.180]   Some of those shifters are inside us.
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:07.740]   So there are these sensory shifters we talked about.
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:08.940]   There are attentional shifters.
[01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:09.900]   We haven't gotten into that yet,
[01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:14.900]   but we can shine our mental spotlight on or away from things
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:17.500]   that are causing emotions.
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:20.380]   And we can be strategic in how we do that.
[01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:22.380]   There are perspective shifters,
[01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:24.260]   the way we think about our circumstances,
[01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:27.740]   reframing, distancing, those are all on the inside.
[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:30.900]   But then there are also shifters that exist outside of us
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:32.500]   in our relationships,
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.700]   how other people can push our emotions
[01:58:34.700 --> 01:58:36.180]   in different directions.
[01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:38.700]   Sometimes other people can be amazing assets,
[01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:42.220]   sometimes tremendous liabilities.
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:45.700]   There are physical shifters like in our spaces.
[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:47.420]   And we just talked about those.
[01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:50.020]   You can then go a layer out even further
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:53.580]   and talk about culture as a shifter.
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:56.540]   People talk about culture as the air we breathe, right?
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:59.800]   We are in different cultures throughout our lives.
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:02.820]   And sometimes we move from one culture to another
[01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:03.660]   within the day.
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:06.140]   So, if you're going to your lab
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:07.780]   or you're on campus at Stanford,
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:11.220]   that's one very specific culture with certain values
[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:15.540]   and norms and weird practices maybe.
[01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:16.940]   That's no offense to Stanford, by the way,
[01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:20.420]   that's more academics, academia has some weird practices.
[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:25.620]   If you then go to your podcast community, right?
[01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:27.340]   The team in the studio that we're sitting here,
[01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:30.900]   there's a different culture that characterizes
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:32.300]   the way you function here.
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:35.580]   And those cultures that we are a part of,
[01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:39.180]   they powerfully shape our emotional lives.
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:44.180]   They influence what kinds of emotional experiences we value.
[01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:46.460]   So, what kinds of emotional experience
[01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:48.560]   are we motivated to have?
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:51.620]   They give us practices, rituals
[01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:53.900]   to meet those emotion regulatory goals
[01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:54.740]   that we have as well.
[01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:57.700]   So, that's another kind of influence
[01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:00.180]   that I don't think we often think about,
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:02.860]   but that is really quite powerful.
[02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:06.980]   - It brings me back again to the smartphone.
[02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:10.620]   The smartphone carries an infinite number of contexts
[02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:13.940]   into the different environments with us.
[02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:15.220]   So, we're on the train,
[02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:17.580]   but we could be paying attention to something overseas.
[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:19.380]   And I was on the plane this morning
[02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:23.980]   and I just marveled at the number of screens
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:28.060]   on this, frankly, very densely packed plane.
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:30.300]   It was like, probably fourth grade
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:32.780]   when a kid brought in a little mini TV.
[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:33.940]   And I remember thinking, oh my goodness,
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:34.940]   that's like a mini TV.
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:37.180]   It looked kind of like a walkie-talkie
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:38.620]   and the resolution was terrible.
[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:39.980]   And of course it was all black and white.
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:42.240]   They had color TVs, by the way, when I was young,
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:44.700]   it just hadn't made it to the mini TV.
[02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:45.980]   And we were basically walking around
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:47.780]   with little mini TVs all day
[02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:50.740]   with near infinite number of channels
[02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:52.100]   combined with texting, sharing.
[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:54.020]   I mean, it's wild.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:54.860]   - Remarkable.
[02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:56.180]   It's science fiction.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:57.660]   If we were to turn back the clock
[02:00:57.660 --> 02:00:59.420]   to when we were kids,
[02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:03.060]   to think about what we have in our pockets right now
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:05.340]   or on our wrists or some people,
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:07.620]   the glasses that they are wearing,
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:09.220]   we probably wouldn't have believed
[02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:11.800]   that this was possible when we were kids.
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:13.760]   - I agree.
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:14.600]   I agree.
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:16.220]   And I'm just struck by the fact
[02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:17.900]   that our brains can adapt to this.
[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:22.620]   But I do think that most people probably wonder about,
[02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:25.920]   you know, like what's the optimal way to live?
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:28.740]   And the word optimal gets people a little, you know,
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:30.940]   a little triggered sometimes, believe it or not.
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:32.380]   I'm not talking about what puts people
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:34.940]   into their best performance mode or this or that.
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:36.620]   I'm not talking about biohacking.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:39.780]   I'm referring to, you know, there's an age old question,
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:41.340]   you know, what is a good life?
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:42.820]   And that's a completely different podcast
[02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:44.380]   that we should probably do at some point.
[02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:46.460]   But it probably involves being able
[02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:48.620]   to pay attention to things and be present,
[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:51.520]   but also let one's mind drift and be socially present
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.020]   and have relationships and on and on.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.220]   Do you think that we are in fact more challenged nowadays
[02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:03.220]   in the default mode of so many contexts arriving with us
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:06.780]   in our pocket when we arrive in a situation,
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:08.380]   like you said, come to the studio.
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:11.620]   As long as my phone's face down or away from me,
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:12.460]   I'm in the studio.
[02:02:12.460 --> 02:02:15.460]   Otherwise, I brought the whole world with me.
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:17.900]   - Yeah, this is a question that comes up quite a bit.
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:19.900]   And it's a really hard one to answer
[02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:24.780]   because we haven't of course been tracking people's chatter
[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:28.640]   and emotion dysregulation levels over the centuries.
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:29.880]   I think it's absolutely true
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:34.360]   that we now have new forms of technology
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:38.480]   that are perennially now presenting us with challenges
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:41.220]   that we need to figure out how to overcome,
[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:44.400]   but they are also providing us with opportunities.
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.080]   So to be clear, I think social media and technology
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:53.560]   can and does do a lot of harm.
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:58.460]   And I think it can and does do a lot of good for us as well.
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:01.580]   And the real challenge we face right now
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:05.620]   is figuring out how to navigate
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:08.880]   those digital technological landscapes.
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:10.860]   And I think we probably jumped into them
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:13.780]   without a user guide too quickly.
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:16.340]   And we're only learning now, 15 years later,
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:19.740]   or whatever the number is, that that was the case.
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:24.360]   But I don't know that I would,
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:26.580]   I don't know that, well, I'll speak for myself.
[02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:28.160]   I think net positive,
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:31.700]   there's a lot of good that has come from these technologies.
[02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:34.040]   If we think back centuries ago,
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:36.800]   it's not clear to me
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.120]   that the world wasn't a challenging place either.
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:45.120]   I mean, we used to get into fights and pull swords
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:49.640]   and there was huge, people would invade readily
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:50.900]   if you go back further.
[02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:53.700]   And there was the threat of illness
[02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:55.800]   and we weren't living nearly as long.
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:59.880]   And so I think it's easy to also forget
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:04.080]   just how far we have come as a species.
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:06.160]   But, and this is, I think, a really important,
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:08.160]   but I think about this often.
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:11.580]   The issues that we are talking about today on this podcast,
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:15.840]   this question of how we manage our emotional lives,
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:18.580]   this is a question that we have been struggling with,
[02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:22.000]   likely for as long as we have been roaming the planet
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.160]   in our current form.
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:24.640]   - Because humans have constantly
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:26.400]   been evolving new technologies.
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:29.800]   - We've always been challenged by circumstances.
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:33.600]   And those circumstances are constantly evolving,
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:35.860]   providing new threats to us
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:38.340]   that now we need to learn how to manage.
[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:40.960]   When I was digging deep
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:44.440]   into the history of emotion regulation for shift,
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:46.960]   I couldn't believe it,
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:50.440]   that when I look back
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:53.840]   at the first surgical tool ever developed,
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:55.000]   you know what that is?
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:55.840]   - Trephining.
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:56.660]   - Trephining.
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:57.880]   So trephination,
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:59.800]   tell everyone who's listening what that involved.
[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:04.800]   - Trephining is where you bore a hole through the skull
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:09.360]   in order to let out some volume of fluid.
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.220]   - Some volume of fluid, or-
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:12.400]   - Or remove brain.
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:16.460]   - Or brain, or if we go back eight to 10,000 years ago
[02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:20.520]   when this technology was first cutting edge, right?
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:22.560]   Like the new iPhone of the times,
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:26.360]   trephination for spirits, for maybe spirits, right?
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:28.360]   So one of the reasons it was believed to be used
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:32.120]   was to allow the evil spirits to escape
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:36.880]   that are maybe causing tremendous emotion dysregulation.
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:39.800]   So that was a cutting edge tool at one moment in time
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:42.320]   that we use to manage our emotions.
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:44.680]   Then let's jump into the mental time travel machine,
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:45.880]   or just the time travel machine
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:48.200]   and go to the late 1940s,
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:50.680]   where there was another major spike
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:53.960]   on the emotion regulation innovation timeline.
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:54.800]   You know where I'm going with this?
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:57.800]   - I'm guessing you're talking about the lobotomy.
[02:05:57.800 --> 02:05:58.920]   - That's right.
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:05:59.760]   - The frontal lobotomy.
[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:03.160]   - A Portuguese physician develops the lobotomy,
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:05.960]   I think it was initially called the leucotomy,
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:09.400]   essentially making some holes in your frontal cortex.
[02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:10.960]   - Going up through the orbit of the eye.
[02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:11.800]   - Through the eye.
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:12.800]   - Sweeping it back and forth.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:15.560]   This was not just an outpatient surgery,
[02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:18.400]   but a mobile surgery that would arrive to people's homes.
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:20.800]   I think, I could be wrong,
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:23.640]   but I think a Nobel prize was given for the lobotomy.
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:24.480]   - Well, there you go.
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:25.320]   That's the-
[02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:26.160]   - Relieved anxiety.
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:27.600]   Unfortunately, it relieved a lot of other things too.
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:29.000]   - Relieved many other things as well.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.560]   - Relieved people's interest in pursuing lots of-
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:35.200]   - It caused major, major, major dysfunction.
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.960]   And to be clear,
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:40.760]   this is not an advocated emotion regulation intervention.
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:42.480]   It hasn't been for a while.
[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:44.440]   - Well, that's why I said don't box.
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:47.080]   Prefrontal cortical damage is a common feature of people
[02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:49.120]   with a box. - Getting hit over and over.
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:51.160]   - Or even, I don't know if this is true,
[02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:52.120]   someone needs to check,
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:54.760]   but I do hear that some, sadly,
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:57.480]   some soccer players who head the ball a lot
[02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:02.480]   deal with some frontal cortical related dementia type stuff.
[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:06.440]   I'm guessing that's probably related
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:08.160]   to some genetic susceptibility,
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:11.440]   because at least to me, the soccer ball is not very hard.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.040]   It's not like they're, you know,
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:16.520]   but, and then again, there are, of course,
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:20.480]   people who play a whole career of football or box,
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:21.720]   less seldom boxing.
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:24.880]   People who get hit a lot in the head often have problems.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:25.880]   They develop problems.
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:27.720]   - Yeah, generally not a good thing.
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:29.760]   But, you know, just to go back to the lobotomy,
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:32.040]   what's amazing to me is like,
[02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:36.000]   that was perceived to be such an advance
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.400]   that it won the Nobel Prize.
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:39.840]   Like the Nobel Prize.
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:40.840]   - Because it calmed people down.
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:42.440]   - Calmed people down, right?
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:46.360]   And so I raise these issues to just point that,
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:48.800]   like we've been struggling to identify tools
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:52.080]   to manage our emotions effectively for a really long time.
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:54.080]   And now fast forward to the present,
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:57.160]   we have not solved the puzzle of emotion regulation yet,
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:59.800]   but I would argue that we have made major advances
[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:03.680]   in identifying non-invasive science-based tools
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:06.640]   that can be leveraged to help people lead
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:09.320]   more productive emotional lives.
[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:13.120]   And so, you know, you raised this question earlier
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:15.400]   about what is a productive life?
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:16.480]   What is a good life?
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:21.480]   And I think answering that question is in part relevant
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:24.560]   to how I think about,
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:28.440]   how do you like define self-control in many ways
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:30.360]   or emotion regulation?
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.720]   Or let me, not just how you define it,
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:35.360]   but what are the component parts?
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:38.320]   So we've been talking about tools
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:40.000]   throughout this conversation.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.560]   All like these different tools that exist,
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:43.280]   these different shifters for pushing our emotions
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:44.440]   or chatter around.
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:48.280]   That's one core part of regulating effectively.
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:53.280]   But another core part is our motivation or our goals.
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:57.160]   And you need both motivation and tools.
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:02.160]   So I can know about all the tools on the planet
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:04.080]   that scientists have discovered.
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:06.760]   If I'm not motivated to manage my emotions,
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:09.000]   I'm not gonna use those tools.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.200]   If on the other hand,
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:13.320]   I am highly motivated to regulate my emotions,
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:15.120]   but I don't know what the tools are,
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:16.400]   I'm not gonna be that effective.
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:20.000]   And I may in fact do some bad things, right?
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.440]   I may, you know, use unhealthy tools,
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:26.040]   substances that really can very powerfully map,
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:28.080]   you know, substance abuse I'm talking about.
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:29.480]   That can modulate my emotions,
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:31.000]   but has some negative consequences.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.040]   So it's about what are my goals for me,
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:36.160]   for my emotional life?
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:37.680]   And do I possess the tools
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:41.640]   that allow me to accomplish those goals?
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:45.160]   I think that is a formula for the good life.
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.640]   Hey, here are the goals that I have.
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:49.940]   And if these are healthy, productive goals,
[02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:52.080]   and I have the means to achieve them,
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:54.560]   that should bring me a sense of satisfaction.
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:56.480]   Sometimes our goals of course, aren't optimal,
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:59.280]   and we use that maybe controversial word,
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:02.440]   but we do change our goals throughout our life.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:05.480]   But it's about finding the right set of goals
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:06.920]   for us as individuals,
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:09.440]   and then identifying the tools that we can use
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:11.680]   to bring those goals to fruition.
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:13.440]   - Yeah, in keeping with this historical arc
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:14.960]   of the tools that humans have used
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:16.320]   to try and regulate emotion,
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:19.040]   you mentioned trephining, frontal lobotomy,
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:22.800]   think about a barbaric appearing procedure,
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:25.160]   but one that actually is pretty effective
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:26.600]   in the right hands,
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:28.840]   and that is still commonly used today,
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:30.960]   electric shock therapy,
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:34.120]   which at a mechanistic level, you know, we-
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:34.960]   - Don't understand.
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:35.820]   - We don't really understand,
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:38.000]   but it seems to lead to a kind of massive dump
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.480]   of a bunch of neuromodulators, dopamine, serotonin,
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:42.920]   but like, you know, almost willy nilly, like just-
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:44.040]   - Yeah, it's like a-
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:46.040]   - And then nowadays, there's a lot of,
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:48.800]   at least interest, if not enthusiasm,
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:52.400]   more work is needed on the various psychedelics,
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:55.700]   in particular psilocybin and MDMA,
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:11:00.400]   for depression and PTSD more specifically.
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:03.840]   And while those are more in the serotonergic pathway,
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:07.040]   that my read of the data is that, you know,
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:08.200]   they're creating, you know,
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:11.060]   more brain-wide connectivity at resting state.
[02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:13.480]   I mean, there's still fairly crude tools
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:15.840]   in terms of you're massively changing the levels
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:17.760]   of given neuromodulators,
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:20.520]   people are undergoing variable experiences.
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:23.340]   It's not like directed in any way.
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:25.720]   Nolan Williams at Stanford is combining those things
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:27.720]   with transcranial magnetic stimulation
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:30.140]   to try and essentially highlight the activity
[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:32.840]   of particular circuits during the psychedelic journeys
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:35.000]   and after, things of that sort.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.060]   So it's getting more specific,
[02:11:37.060 --> 02:11:38.280]   but I would say even today,
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:40.960]   we don't really have great pharmacologic
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:44.160]   or surgical tools for emotion.
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:47.680]   Now, there's terrific neurosurgery going on, mind you,
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:51.480]   but when it comes to behavioral tools
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:53.040]   for emotion regulation,
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:55.560]   I feel like the psychologists, you all,
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:58.600]   you and your colleagues have done a tremendous job,
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:01.480]   as have the people from, you know,
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:02.600]   for lack of a better name,
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:04.840]   the sort of ancient traditions
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:08.780]   and from the wellness community, you know,
[02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:10.280]   things like long exhale breathing,
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:12.080]   physiological size, meditation.
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:14.320]   Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:16.280]   showing you 13 minutes a day of meditation
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:19.240]   improves focus, emotion, emotional state.
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.360]   So it seems to me that the behavioral tools
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:26.040]   are getting way out ahead of the surgical
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:27.440]   and even pharmacologic tools
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.540]   in terms of their specificity, their safety,
[02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:31.640]   and maybe even their potency.
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:33.800]   Would you care to reflect on what you see
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:37.280]   as the most valuable tools for emotion regulation?
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:40.220]   Well, you've touched on some of them today, but already,
[02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:43.960]   but I mean, taking a walk, green spaces,
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:46.600]   time, you know, mental time travel, fantasy,
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:48.360]   I listed a few more of these off.
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:52.880]   I mean, these might seem kind of more modal,
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:54.840]   you know, top-level contour things,
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:56.280]   but they work, right?
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:58.080]   I mean, the data say they work, journaling.
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:01.220]   Yeah, I mean, they're mechanistically,
[02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:03.420]   you know, we understand the mechanisms
[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:08.280]   that are underlying the benefits of these tools.
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:12.520]   They are easy to implement, and not always,
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:13.600]   but for a lot of them, they're easy,
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:17.380]   and I think that's in part where their power resides.
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:21.340]   We are still trying to understand how the brain functions.
[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:23.540]   As you well know, you've contributed to this.
[02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:26.020]   I've worked on this a little bit myself, too.
[02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:28.380]   The brain is a remarkably complicated organ,
[02:13:28.380 --> 02:13:30.520]   and we still have a lot to learn.
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:34.140]   I'm a big fan of trying to understand
[02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:37.140]   how phenomena like emotion play out
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:39.580]   at different levels of analysis,
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:42.500]   at the psychological level of thinking and feeling,
[02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:44.700]   but also at the biological level
[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:48.380]   in terms of patterns of neural activity and hormones
[02:13:48.380 --> 02:13:49.580]   and so forth and so on,
[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:51.580]   and so I think there's great hope
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:55.900]   that we will be able to eventually, down the road,
[02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:59.300]   try to help people manage their emotions
[02:13:59.300 --> 02:14:02.500]   through multiple different sources of intervention,
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:04.420]   through the pharmacological level,
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:06.100]   through the behavioral level,
[02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:08.180]   through the interpersonal level,
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:10.420]   but it's a messy, messy space right now,
[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:12.460]   and I think one of the big problems is,
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:16.500]   and this is in part gets to bigger questions about science
[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:18.620]   and how science is done,
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:22.560]   it can be hard to cross levels of analysis,
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:25.700]   and there are multiple practical constraints
[02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:27.320]   that become active here,
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:29.900]   so having the large enough samples
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:32.300]   and the right collaborators to look at
[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:35.080]   how different kinds of interventions
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:36.860]   interact with one another,
[02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:38.380]   work in different populations,
[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:43.380]   and so we tend not to do those more complicated designs
[02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:45.960]   because they're a lot harder to do.
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:49.460]   They take a ton more money, a ton more time and effort,
[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:53.060]   and oftentimes, scientists are on timelines
[02:14:53.060 --> 02:14:54.580]   and there are incentive structures
[02:14:54.580 --> 02:14:57.060]   that guide the kind of work that they do,
[02:14:57.060 --> 02:15:00.460]   but big picture, down the road,
[02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:03.200]   I think the big questions are about
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:05.900]   how do these different kinds of interventions
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:07.840]   interact with one another?
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:09.020]   The good news is, though,
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:11.500]   that for any person who is watching or listening
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:14.700]   who's motivated to manage their emotions right now,
[02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:17.220]   there are many things you can do to start,
[02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:19.900]   and it begins, step one,
[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:22.500]   learning about what these tools are,
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:23.820]   and then starting this process
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:25.700]   of experimenting with the tools.
[02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:27.420]   I don't use that word experimenting lightly.
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:30.820]   I wouldn't advocate experimenting with agents
[02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:32.980]   that have serious side effects of the sort
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:34.760]   that some of the biological interventions
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:36.720]   you articulated earlier do.
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:37.860]   Those kinds of tools, I think,
[02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:41.820]   should be used in the context of medical supervision,
[02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:44.140]   but a lot of these other tools that we're talking about,
[02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:46.660]   small changes in how you think and behave
[02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:49.220]   and interact with your environments,
[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:52.220]   those are things people can start doing right now.
[02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:54.260]   - One of the most common questions I've received
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:57.660]   over the years is, on YouTube in particular,
[02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:01.380]   is how to stop intrusive voices,
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:04.340]   and occasionally when people ask these questions,
[02:16:04.340 --> 02:16:09.140]   they'll highlight that some parent
[02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:14.140]   or an ex or something will kind of a judge voice in there,
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:16.220]   and they don't know if it's their voice
[02:16:16.220 --> 02:16:17.140]   or the other person's voice,
[02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:19.540]   but it's in their head and it's very unpleasant.
[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:23.420]   Presumably this circles back to childhood traumas
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:24.440]   or other forms of traumas,
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:27.860]   but irrespective of the origins,
[02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:30.660]   are there any tools specifically to deal
[02:16:30.660 --> 02:16:33.980]   with intrusive thoughts and thought patterns,
[02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:36.100]   maybe even OCD-like thought patterns?
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:38.720]   - So a couple of responses to that.
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:42.740]   So first of all, I think step one is recognizing
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:45.680]   that if you are hearing another voice,
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:49.220]   like if you can hear your dad's voice in your head,
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:51.260]   it's not your dad who is in your head,
[02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:53.620]   that is a simulation that you are engaging in
[02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:57.100]   that your brain is capable of producing.
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:17:00.420]   And so that I think can be informative
[02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:02.660]   for people who are curious about these inner worlds.
[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:03.500]   Like I could hear-
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:05.540]   - I'm not referring to auditory hallucinations.
[02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:09.500]   I'm referring to the language of somebody,
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:12.140]   maybe not in that person's voice,
[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:14.920]   but they're hearing like, maybe not you're a bad person,
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:17.980]   but like you're never good, you're not good enough.
[02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:20.540]   Like it's not enough or just feeling like,
[02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:23.780]   so they can't enjoy the good things in life
[02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:25.940]   because of these intrusive negative voices.
[02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:28.700]   - Here's something that I hope listeners
[02:17:28.700 --> 02:17:31.980]   and viewers will find exceptionally liberating
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:34.780]   as I have found liberating from just knowing the science.
[02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:38.260]   So actually I talk about these intrusive thoughts in "Shift."
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:42.220]   They are incredibly normative.
[02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:43.780]   And so there's research which looks at like,
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:46.360]   how frequently have you experienced an intrusive thought
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:48.600]   over the past week or month or two months?
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:51.800]   The proportion of people who experience these dark thoughts
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:54.520]   is exceptionally high.
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:56.420]   I don't remember the exact percentage,
[02:17:56.420 --> 02:18:00.240]   but it is in my book and it is like near ceiling.
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:02.840]   I will do an exercise with my classes,
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:04.320]   my undergraduate classes,
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:08.920]   where I will ask them to anonymously describe
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:10.840]   whether they've experienced like a dark thought
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:11.920]   over the past week.
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:15.020]   Almost all of them are capable of generating them.
[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:18.900]   And some of these thoughts are really, really dark.
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:23.340]   I will often experience a very dark intrusive thought
[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:25.380]   when I'm exercising at the gym.
[02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:26.860]   You're looking at me with curiosity
[02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:28.060]   and a bit of concern right now.
[02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:30.580]   - No, I'm not concerned, I'm just fascinated.
[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:32.340]   You know, I have ideas about why this may be,
[02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:33.840]   but I'm just fascinated.
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:35.980]   I don't know that I've had dark thoughts in the gym,
[02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:37.340]   but it's interesting.
[02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:38.260]   - Here's my dark thought.
[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:41.000]   Watch out if you see me in the gym from here on.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:45.280]   So if I'm carrying like a heavy dumbbell
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:47.520]   from a bench to a rack,
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:50.600]   I will sometimes have a thought of dropping it
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:54.200]   on the face of another person on a mat.
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:55.040]   - Oh my goodness.
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:56.440]   - It's terribly dark.
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:58.240]   It's a terrible, terrible thought.
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:00.580]   So why am I experiencing that?
[02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:05.580]   It is most likely the brain's simulating worst case scenarios
[02:19:05.580 --> 02:19:06.960]   to prevent me from doing it.
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:09.200]   Of course, I don't wanna drop a dumbbell
[02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:10.640]   on someone I never have.
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:14.400]   And so that's one explanation for why this is so normative.
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:17.760]   It's your brain's way of constantly,
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:20.920]   there's a theory that we're constantly simulating
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:24.120]   all sorts of possibilities for what could happen.
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:25.840]   And most of these simulations,
[02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:27.680]   the probability of them coming to fruition
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:31.280]   are exceptionally low, infinitesimally small.
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:33.040]   But on occasion, some of the wacky ones
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:34.880]   do escape into awareness.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:36.960]   And that's when we get the dark thought
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:40.480]   about harming someone or doing something illegal
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:42.360]   in a pretty egregious way,
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:44.560]   or in my case, dropping the dumbbell
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:47.880]   on the person stretching on their face.
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:50.820]   And so here's what I find liberating.
[02:19:50.820 --> 02:19:55.820]   Me understanding that this is just how my brain works.
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:59.480]   Well, that doesn't mean now
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:03.000]   that I'm something wrong with me as a human being, right?
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.920]   That I'm morally corrupt in any way.
[02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:07.320]   My brain's gonna sometimes produce
[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:08.920]   these kinds of dark thoughts.
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:10.520]   I'm not gonna act on them.
[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:13.920]   And as long as I'm not acting on them, it's all good.
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:16.040]   It's almost like when people learn
[02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:20.280]   about the physiological response to anxiety,
[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:23.560]   before they know what is happening,
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:26.320]   that can often be an incredibly distressing experience.
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:28.840]   Like all of a sudden, your stomach is churning,
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:31.000]   your palms are sweating.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:35.060]   But in research, which shows like if you communicate
[02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:39.780]   to people, hey, this is just your body preparing yourselves
[02:20:39.780 --> 02:20:41.780]   to adaptively respond
[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:44.920]   to this uncertain circumstance you face.
[02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:47.560]   All of a sudden, you are totally flipping the frame.
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:51.840]   And now this is, I'm a Lamborghini, right?
[02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:53.280]   I am rising to the occasion.
[02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:55.600]   My body's doing what it should be doing
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:57.620]   to allow me to excel here.
[02:20:57.620 --> 02:20:59.720]   That's the kind of flip that I think
[02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:03.080]   understanding the frequency and origins
[02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:05.160]   of intrusive thoughts can have for folks.
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:07.160]   So step one is just recognizing
[02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:08.960]   if you experience intrusive thoughts at times.
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:10.960]   Again, welcome to the human condition.
[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:14.560]   It's a little blip in how our brain operates.
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:17.200]   But a lot of these tools have also been shown to be useful
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:21.040]   for nipping repetitive thinking in the bud.
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:24.080]   So when you're curtailing chatter,
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:28.200]   you are also curtailing the likelihood of perseverating.
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:30.840]   The reason why we often perseverate
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:33.680]   on problems we're experiencing is we are,
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:37.720]   we're highly motivated to make sense of these circumstances
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:39.400]   so we can move on with our lives.
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:41.760]   And our brain, this wonderful problem-solving organ
[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:43.680]   that we possess, it just keeps churning
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:45.160]   until we've solved that problem.
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:48.480]   And that's surfacing all sorts of related thoughts
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:50.320]   here and there until you get there.
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:52.520]   And so when you solve the problem,
[02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:55.120]   those thoughts tend to subside too.
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:57.920]   - I have two points,
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:21:59.920]   both of which are essentially questions.
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:04.240]   I think it's relatively common for people
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:06.080]   when they go to a bridge or a dam
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:09.680]   or something very high with the potential
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:12.320]   for essentially a fatal fall,
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:15.080]   were they to jump off, to have the thought,
[02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:16.880]   what keeps me from jumping off
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:19.240]   when in fact they absolutely don't want to jump off?
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:21.320]   And it seems like it's another example of like,
[02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:22.760]   it's registering the danger
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:24.680]   and the severity of the consequences.
[02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:28.040]   It also, I realize, helps us understand the level of risk.
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:28.880]   - That's right.
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:30.480]   - You know, I think Alex Honnold,
[02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:34.960]   who famously did "Free Solo" to El Cap,
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:36.280]   a remarkable movie, by the way,
[02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:39.320]   just along the lines of what we're talking about,
[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:41.280]   the way the movie is constructed,
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:43.920]   and I think Jimmy Chin and colleagues who made that movie
[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:45.360]   did such an incredible job,
[02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:46.560]   not just with the cinematography,
[02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:48.280]   but you know he survives
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:49.640]   from the very beginning of the movie,
[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:51.840]   and yet it's terrifying to watch the whole thing.
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:56.640]   And it's kind of a hour, 45 minute expedition
[02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:59.200]   of exactly what we're talking about.
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:00.280]   In that movie, as I recall,
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:04.640]   Alex spells out the assessment of risk and consequence,
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:07.800]   right, you know, level of risk, level of consequence,
[02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:10.640]   and how those are key parameters to evaluate,
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:13.160]   and he's obviously done that for himself and he succeeded.
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:15.480]   And I hope he never does it again,
[02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:18.640]   only because he seems like a really delightful person
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:20.480]   when it'd be nice to keep him around.
[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:22.440]   And he's doing other important work now.
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:26.720]   But the point being that I think it's a very natural thing
[02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:29.240]   to evaluate risk and consequence
[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:32.080]   in a way that "feels dark,"
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:34.260]   but it's actually highly adaptive
[02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:36.820]   through the lens that we're talking about it.
[02:23:36.820 --> 02:23:38.340]   So that's one point.
[02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:40.540]   - Well, just to that point, if I can interject,
[02:23:40.540 --> 02:23:44.080]   so just to normalize this further for folks,
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:49.080]   so my family is very special to me as it is to most people.
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:52.320]   When my first daughter was born,
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:54.480]   we used to live in this house that had this,
[02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:56.520]   on the second floor, there was a,
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:23:58.400]   I don't know if you'd describe it as an overpass,
[02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:00.720]   but it was open to the floor beneath.
[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:03.440]   And I remember having these intrusive thoughts of,
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:05.320]   at night when we'd have to bring my daughter
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:07.560]   into the bedroom to feed her or change her diaper,
[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:10.800]   whatever, I would have these thoughts of carrying her
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:15.000]   and then dropping her over into the, you know,
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.780]   and splat, like not pleasant thoughts to experience
[02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:20.160]   in the middle of the night.
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:22.720]   It speaks to this point that you are raising
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:26.280]   that was likely my mind's way of homing in
[02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:29.120]   on a really, really important issue in my life
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:32.320]   that I want to make sure never, ever, ever happens.
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:35.360]   It is not an indication that I'm morally corrupt
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:37.640]   or incredibly dark person.
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:40.320]   It's how my brain is operating, so.
[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:42.520]   - Yeah, you're assessing risk and consequence
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:44.020]   in an adaptive way.
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:49.100]   - Yeah, it's fascinating to think about.
[02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:53.620]   The second comment/question that I'd love your thoughts on
[02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:57.180]   is, you know, I had this bulldog,
[02:24:57.180 --> 02:24:59.380]   I talk about him all the time, this bulldog Mastiff,
[02:24:59.380 --> 02:25:02.620]   and he had one default behavior
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:05.220]   that if he couldn't engage in it,
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:06.500]   would create anxiety in him.
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:08.500]   And that was he liked to chew.
[02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:09.860]   Like he liked to gnaw on things.
[02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:12.100]   As a puppy, he actually would teeth on bricks
[02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:13.100]   in the backyard.
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:15.460]   I was like, oh my goodness, it looks so painful to me.
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:17.740]   Sometimes he'd bite through a lip.
[02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:19.780]   You know, the bulldog part of their phenotype
[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:21.040]   is that a lot of the pain receptors
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:22.720]   have been bred out of their face.
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:23.880]   And I just think, oh my goodness,
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:26.040]   I go out there and I was like distraught
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:27.560]   at how much pain he must be causing himself.
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:30.040]   It was obviously less than I perceived.
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:34.000]   But nonetheless, this gnawing behavior was,
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:34.840]   you could just see it.
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:36.680]   It gave him such pleasure, right?
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:37.520]   You give him something to chew on,
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:41.460]   and you could just see the anxiety like dissolve out of him.
[02:25:41.460 --> 02:25:44.360]   I've known a number of people
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:45.760]   that are fairly high intensity
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:47.520]   in terms of they speak fast,
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:49.760]   high density of thought, information, et cetera,
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:50.880]   at least outwardly,
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:54.400]   who claim that they have got sort of a high RPM internally.
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:57.840]   And I vary, and depending on time of day
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:25:59.160]   and time of year on this,
[02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:02.440]   but I place myself more or less into that category.
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:06.020]   Engaging in an activity that harnesses my full attention,
[02:26:06.020 --> 02:26:08.960]   perhaps we could call it flow,
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:11.480]   but nonetheless engaging in an activity
[02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:13.360]   that harnesses my full attention,
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:18.200]   feels to me so unbelievably satisfying.
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:19.440]   - Yeah.
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:20.920]   - So unbelievably satisfying.
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:22.000]   I think it's for two reasons.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.480]   One is the benefits of doing those activities,
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:27.600]   studying, learning, podcasting, doing research,
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:29.440]   connecting with someone in a really directed way,
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:31.960]   like getting into that tunnel with them,
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:33.800]   as we're doing now.
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:35.400]   There's a positive feature,
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:37.440]   and then there's also the removal of a negative,
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:41.280]   like that those RPM are not humming in the background.
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:43.280]   And I think for a lot of people,
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:48.280]   like ultra runners, and I know a lot of former addicts
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:51.320]   that start running marathons and get sober and stay sober.
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:52.680]   - Yeah.
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:55.200]   - It's remarkable how physical activity
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:57.680]   or cognitive activity can kind of take us
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:01.600]   into that plane of focus that both makes us productive,
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:04.680]   makes us fitter, but also relieves this inner voice.
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:06.640]   It kind of like lets the tension out the same way
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:09.040]   that I observed Costello letting the tension out
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:11.240]   through gnawing on these bricks or rawhides
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:13.120]   or whatever it was.
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:14.640]   And so my question is,
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:18.480]   is there, as I'm assuming,
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:21.280]   a relationship between the physical and the mental?
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:24.280]   Do we basically have a certain amount of energy in us,
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:25.520]   and it varies between people,
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:29.520]   and we need to harness and/or adjust that level of energy
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:32.040]   and to do that in ways that hopefully make us a living
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:35.080]   or bring our social relationships more closely together?
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:38.040]   - Well, it certainly plays out in physical context
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:38.880]   as you're describing,
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:40.520]   but it also, as you alluded to,
[02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:42.780]   plays out in cognitive contexts.
[02:27:42.780 --> 02:27:44.800]   When there is this match,
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:48.720]   this sweet spot between the demands,
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:52.640]   like you're in a situation that is actually challenging,
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:55.240]   either physically or cognitively,
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:59.280]   and the resources that you bring to that situation
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:02.320]   perfectly match the demands.
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:03.880]   So it's a taxing situation,
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:07.340]   but you are able to engage with it completely.
[02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:10.260]   That is the formula for getting,
[02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:11.440]   stuck is the wrong word,
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:14.540]   for getting immersed in these kinds of flow states,
[02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:16.400]   which are, for many people,
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:19.300]   the goal that they have in their lives,
[02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:21.440]   both recreationally and professionally.
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:24.120]   And so you, as someone who is ideally
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:26.760]   getting into these flow states with your guests,
[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:27.860]   I would hope and imagine,
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:30.080]   and that's always the aspiration,
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:32.200]   that must feel really good.
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:35.840]   I mean, you talk for a long time with people.
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:37.080]   Does it feel like a long time
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:38.360]   when you're having those conversations?
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:40.580]   - No, time perception completely changes.
[02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:42.220]   And when I do this for two or three hours a week,
[02:28:42.220 --> 02:28:43.740]   and then when we do a solo episode,
[02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:45.820]   sometimes the recording's longest ever yet
[02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:48.400]   is 11 hours edited down.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:53.400]   But those can be anywhere from 90 minutes to four hours,
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:56.420]   or a live event.
[02:28:56.420 --> 02:28:58.620]   And I couldn't tell you,
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:00.380]   it just seems like time just passes.
[02:29:00.380 --> 02:29:01.540]   Time dissolves away.
[02:29:01.540 --> 02:29:06.060]   - And when, that is because you are so absorbed in the moment
[02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:09.380]   and meeting the challenges of that situation,
[02:29:09.380 --> 02:29:11.860]   that all of your attention is commanded
[02:29:11.860 --> 02:29:16.460]   to that point in time, that moment.
[02:29:16.460 --> 02:29:18.560]   And that doesn't leave a whole lot of room
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:22.860]   for all of the chatter to percolate in the background.
[02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:24.660]   And so, you know, one often,
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:27.140]   you might think like an ultra marathon,
[02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:28.320]   or what's the correct term?
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:29.160]   Is that it?
[02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:29.980]   - Oh, it's called an ultra.
[02:29:29.980 --> 02:29:32.780]   I think we have some triathletes here in the room,
[02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:36.140]   our producer, Rob Moore, sitting to my left.
[02:29:36.140 --> 02:29:37.940]   We've never done this before,
[02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:39.260]   but how long is an ultra?
[02:29:39.260 --> 02:29:41.340]   Anything longer than a marathon, is that right?
[02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:42.180]   He's giving a nod.
[02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:44.180]   He is gonna remain silent.
[02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:47.020]   Anything longer than a marathon is considered an ultra.
[02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:49.780]   - And so that's a lot of time on the one hand
[02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:52.580]   to be alone with your thoughts, right?
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:55.320]   And you might think that might just be grounds
[02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:57.260]   for experiencing chatter,
[02:29:57.260 --> 02:29:59.340]   but it's also a particularly challenging
[02:29:59.340 --> 02:30:01.140]   kind of physical feat
[02:30:01.140 --> 02:30:02.880]   that you have to devote a lot of resources
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:05.340]   to meeting those physical demands.
[02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:07.800]   And right, so that can propel you into a state of flow.
[02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:10.580]   And then you get some runners high to boot,
[02:30:10.580 --> 02:30:13.300]   some like chemical boost to enhance your mood.
[02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:16.180]   And all of a sudden now you have people running,
[02:30:16.180 --> 02:30:17.440]   you know, 130 miles.
[02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:18.280]   I'm exaggerating.
[02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:19.100]   How long is it?
[02:30:19.100 --> 02:30:19.940]   - Oh, people, I mean,
[02:30:19.940 --> 02:30:22.700]   people have done 200 mile ultras, 150 mile ultras.
[02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:24.980]   People, we have a friend, you know,
[02:30:24.980 --> 02:30:25.820]   again, my producer, Rob Moore,
[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:27.300]   and I have a friend, Ken Rideout,
[02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:31.980]   who does these sorts of races in the Gobi desert.
[02:30:31.980 --> 02:30:34.060]   He did it without any prior training in the desert,
[02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:34.980]   then won.
[02:30:34.980 --> 02:30:37.660]   I mean, but you know, these,
[02:30:37.660 --> 02:30:39.780]   Ken in particular, I'm thinking about right now,
[02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:41.660]   he's a very high energy guy.
[02:30:41.660 --> 02:30:44.640]   I would be concerned about Ken and his family,
[02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:46.900]   not their safety, but their sanity,
[02:30:46.900 --> 02:30:49.180]   if Ken didn't run that much.
[02:30:49.180 --> 02:30:50.940]   Because he's just, he's-
[02:30:50.940 --> 02:30:51.860]   - He needs to burn it off.
[02:30:51.860 --> 02:30:53.500]   - He just has that much energy.
[02:30:53.500 --> 02:30:54.700]   And the whole concept of energy
[02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:56.860]   is something that I'm getting more and more interested in,
[02:30:56.860 --> 02:30:58.660]   you know, as we age, we tend to have less energy.
[02:30:58.660 --> 02:30:59.500]   What is that?
[02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:00.940]   Is it mitochondrial density and function?
[02:31:00.940 --> 02:31:01.860]   Probably.
[02:31:01.860 --> 02:31:03.060]   But what we're talking about here
[02:31:03.060 --> 02:31:05.540]   is a sort of cognitive velocity.
[02:31:05.540 --> 02:31:06.940]   You know, it's not an official term,
[02:31:06.940 --> 02:31:08.580]   but it's one that I'm using more and more nowadays.
[02:31:08.580 --> 02:31:09.540]   - Yeah, that's a good one.
[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:12.120]   - You know, people should try this.
[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:13.620]   I'm curious, have you ever done this?
[02:31:13.620 --> 02:31:16.060]   You sit down to read a page of a book,
[02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:17.420]   trying to remember the information.
[02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:19.340]   Maybe it's technical, maybe it's not.
[02:31:19.340 --> 02:31:21.240]   And then you flip the page
[02:31:21.240 --> 02:31:23.420]   and you try and read a page of the very same book
[02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:25.260]   a little bit faster than you're comfortable
[02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:26.980]   while trying to retain the information.
[02:31:26.980 --> 02:31:29.200]   And I find that there's this like sweet spot for reading
[02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:31.180]   where kind of like there's a sweet spot for running
[02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:33.360]   where going a little faster sometimes
[02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:36.860]   actually feels like it requires less effort.
[02:31:36.860 --> 02:31:39.420]   - Yeah, well, it's interesting that you say that
[02:31:39.420 --> 02:31:43.220]   because I actually engage in that exercise quite frequently.
[02:31:43.220 --> 02:31:48.220]   So, you know, I'm constantly reading for my job, right?
[02:31:48.220 --> 02:31:51.300]   If I'm not reading journal articles, I'm reading books
[02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:53.780]   for, you know, research that I'm doing, writing books.
[02:31:53.780 --> 02:31:58.300]   And the way I do it is often through an audio form
[02:31:58.300 --> 02:32:02.380]   and I will put the speed rate up to two X.
[02:32:02.380 --> 02:32:04.860]   I'll often go as high as I can go on the app.
[02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:07.940]   And I can retain a huge amount of information
[02:32:07.940 --> 02:32:10.700]   going that fast, but it does require
[02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:12.420]   that I'm very vigilant.
[02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:16.180]   I'm really carefully attending to that audio book
[02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:18.380]   when I'm moving at that speed.
[02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:22.220]   And so it's not what I would do on vacation
[02:32:22.220 --> 02:32:26.540]   when I'm trying to consume a book or information for fun.
[02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:31.220]   You know, there, I just wanna kind of just gently go,
[02:32:31.220 --> 02:32:34.460]   let the paragraph, you know, kind of pass my gaze
[02:32:34.460 --> 02:32:37.780]   and take it in slowly and almost even savor,
[02:32:37.780 --> 02:32:39.380]   savor the words on the page.
[02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:43.140]   But in other contexts, I do channel up the velocity
[02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:45.140]   and it can be incredibly engaging.
[02:32:45.140 --> 02:32:46.920]   It can also be depleting.
[02:32:46.920 --> 02:32:50.540]   So when you have conversations that really
[02:32:50.540 --> 02:32:53.580]   you find immensely rewarding and, you know,
[02:32:53.580 --> 02:32:55.500]   cognitive philosophy, and I love that term
[02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:59.580]   is, you know, a 10 out of 10.
[02:32:59.580 --> 02:33:02.900]   When you're done, do you ever find it a little tiring?
[02:33:02.900 --> 02:33:06.340]   - Not immediately, but my personal challenge in life
[02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:09.420]   is I don't transition states very well.
[02:33:09.420 --> 02:33:11.780]   So it takes me a little while to drop into a state,
[02:33:11.780 --> 02:33:12.660]   but then I stay there.
[02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:14.740]   So I'll come out of here still thinking about
[02:33:14.740 --> 02:33:17.340]   and talking about this to myself or with others
[02:33:17.340 --> 02:33:21.500]   for a fair amount of time, maybe on the order of,
[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:23.620]   you know, half an hour to hours.
[02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:26.860]   I've learned this about myself over the years.
[02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:28.820]   It's very effective for science and for certain things,
[02:33:28.820 --> 02:33:30.620]   less effective for other areas of life.
[02:33:30.620 --> 02:33:33.140]   I've learned ways to transition faster,
[02:33:33.140 --> 02:33:37.620]   but then I will notice if I do, you know,
[02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:40.920]   record a solo and a guest episode and some intros
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:43.780]   and stuff in the same week that, yeah, on Saturday,
[02:33:43.780 --> 02:33:47.140]   I'm kind of like my mind feels like it's like white noise.
[02:33:47.140 --> 02:33:48.260]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:51.900]   - And I've long thought that having,
[02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:54.660]   I used to call them low cortisol days, you know,
[02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:57.340]   just a day where I'm just kind of like veg.
[02:33:57.340 --> 02:33:59.260]   - And you're more tired probably on those days, huh?
[02:33:59.260 --> 02:34:01.140]   - Yeah, I just let myself reset.
[02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:02.740]   It was actually in my list of questions
[02:34:02.740 --> 02:34:04.260]   to ask you about resetting,
[02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:06.420]   going into kind of a state of wordlessness
[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:10.860]   and just letting things just spool out for an hour,
[02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:13.940]   like not trying to control anything,
[02:34:13.940 --> 02:34:16.540]   not trying to control anything in the universe except,
[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:18.700]   you know, basic functions, right?
[02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:23.280]   - Cook cooking shows, prank reels.
[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:24.180]   - These are yours.
[02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:25.020]   - These are mine.
[02:34:25.020 --> 02:34:29.380]   And like I am, you know, we often take for granted too,
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:31.260]   that the TV in front of us
[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:34.020]   is another emotion regulation device, right?
[02:34:34.020 --> 02:34:36.300]   And actually people who are creating programs
[02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:39.420]   are deliberately trying to push your emotions
[02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:42.540]   in particular directions from the score that accompanies
[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:45.420]   movies and the news.
[02:34:45.420 --> 02:34:50.140]   So I don't want my emotions being shifted in a direction
[02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:52.700]   that is contrary to my goals right before I go to bed.
[02:34:52.700 --> 02:34:56.500]   I am at a typically high velocity level throughout the day,
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:34:59.020]   starting with physical stuff and exercise
[02:34:59.020 --> 02:35:02.300]   to the cognitive stuff and the politicking
[02:35:02.300 --> 02:35:05.220]   and the science talks and all that stuff.
[02:35:05.220 --> 02:35:08.740]   When I'm finally done going through my email at night,
[02:35:08.740 --> 02:35:13.740]   I want like a good hour of just total mindless vegetation.
[02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:17.820]   And it puts me in a wonderfully serene state
[02:35:17.820 --> 02:35:19.660]   to then slide into bed,
[02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:21.500]   jump into that mental time travel machine,
[02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:23.940]   like do the fantasizing or savoring,
[02:35:23.940 --> 02:35:25.080]   and then puts me to sleep.
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:28.180]   And so, you know, I really value technology there
[02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:29.440]   for helping me do that.
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:32.900]   And I think that is the counterpoint
[02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:37.300]   to having this high velocity kind of experience.
[02:35:37.300 --> 02:35:39.100]   I will often, when I teach,
[02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:41.780]   like sometimes I'll teach for like three hours.
[02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:44.180]   So it's, you know, equivalent to what we're doing right now.
[02:35:44.180 --> 02:35:46.820]   It is so unbelievably engaging and rewarding.
[02:35:46.820 --> 02:35:48.740]   And like, this is why I got into this business.
[02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:51.620]   You are, you're, you know, you're having great conversations
[02:35:51.620 --> 02:35:53.540]   and you're hopefully like changing the way people think
[02:35:53.540 --> 02:35:56.740]   about things, getting them to discover interests,
[02:35:56.740 --> 02:35:57.780]   all that good stuff.
[02:35:57.780 --> 02:36:00.900]   Couple hours later when I come home,
[02:36:00.900 --> 02:36:03.160]   first of all, I need a little refractory period
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:06.340]   to switch out of work life into home life,
[02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:09.180]   which can often be challenging on the personal front.
[02:36:09.180 --> 02:36:11.180]   Cause like my kids are just waiting there.
[02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:12.620]   Well, my youngest kid is waiting there.
[02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:15.500]   My oldest kid is now in her room doing her own thing,
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:17.140]   but they want to play right away.
[02:36:17.140 --> 02:36:20.560]   And I need some time just to decompress.
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:23.900]   But then once I do, I've got to lean further into that state.
[02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:26.860]   And so that's, that is shifting
[02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:28.640]   and understanding how to shift.
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:30.780]   That's a different kind of shift,
[02:36:30.780 --> 02:36:34.860]   but it is all about shifting our states to meet our goals
[02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:38.980]   and trying to understand how to do that well.
[02:36:38.980 --> 02:36:40.900]   And I think that is the subtext to everything
[02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:42.560]   that we are talking about here.
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:45.700]   - Yeah, it's such an important aspect of life.
[02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:47.740]   And I do think that everyone would do well
[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:52.740]   to evaluate for themselves how quickly, well, not well,
[02:36:52.740 --> 02:36:54.700]   you know, we're not trying to place a grade on it,
[02:36:54.700 --> 02:36:57.500]   but how quickly or slowly one transitions
[02:36:57.500 --> 02:36:59.020]   into and out of states.
[02:36:59.020 --> 02:37:01.500]   How much of your thoughts and emotions
[02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:05.260]   and experience you're carrying forward from one context
[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:08.140]   to the next, I think about that a lot.
[02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:10.940]   And it's something that I try and work with a lot,
[02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:13.300]   especially, you know, arriving home and there's people home
[02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:15.740]   and you want to engage in a particular way.
[02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:18.860]   - And there's actually a framework to help people do this
[02:37:18.860 --> 02:37:20.040]   that I really like.
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:20.880]   And it's interesting
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:23.440]   because you mentioned the military earlier,
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:26.260]   and there's a wonderful corollary.
[02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:29.700]   And it's, I haven't experienced this too often in my life
[02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:32.700]   where I see something in science that scaffolds on
[02:37:32.700 --> 02:37:36.260]   to a practice that another organization, in this case,
[02:37:36.260 --> 02:37:40.600]   the military implements to help people, number one,
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:43.660]   identify what are their,
[02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:45.300]   in the context of what we're talking about,
[02:37:45.300 --> 02:37:47.060]   what are their emotion regulation goals?
[02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:48.420]   What are their shifting goals?
[02:37:48.420 --> 02:37:53.020]   And how do you go from having those goals
[02:37:53.020 --> 02:37:55.380]   to bringing them to fruition?
[02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:59.020]   And so in the military, like special forces,
[02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:02.220]   before they have complex, complicated operations,
[02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:05.620]   they will often first think about, okay, what's our goal?
[02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:08.900]   What's the outcome we hope to achieve?
[02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:11.180]   Then what are the obstacles that we can anticipate
[02:38:11.180 --> 02:38:14.240]   that might undermine our ability to achieve that goal?
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:16.300]   And they'll go around the room and, you know,
[02:38:16.300 --> 02:38:19.140]   the person in charge will like cold call
[02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:21.140]   Socratic style on folks,
[02:38:21.140 --> 02:38:24.740]   like what is the potential obstacle?
[02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:27.880]   And then for every obstacle that they identify,
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:30.380]   they come up with a very specific,
[02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:33.260]   if this happens, then we will do this.
[02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:35.820]   And they have multiple if then plans
[02:38:35.820 --> 02:38:37.980]   for each of those different obstacles.
[02:38:37.980 --> 02:38:40.060]   So if we go back to the research landscape,
[02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:41.540]   there's a technique called WOOP.
[02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:42.980]   Have you ever heard of this?
[02:38:42.980 --> 02:38:45.480]   Okay, so it's, WOOP is an acronym,
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:47.880]   and I promise you I wouldn't use any acronyms,
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:50.060]   but this is a useful one to,
[02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:51.820]   it's a mnemonic to remember something.
[02:38:51.820 --> 02:38:56.820]   So how do you go from knowing to doing?
[02:38:56.980 --> 02:39:00.640]   WOOP is designed to help you do that,
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:03.400]   because what it is explicitly designed to do
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:06.840]   is target each of the places
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:10.140]   where goal pursuit often breaks down.
[02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:12.400]   Step one, what's your wish?
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:13.680]   What's the thing you hope to accomplish?
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:16.720]   Let's be really clear about what that goal is.
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:18.280]   We often don't stop to even think about
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:20.920]   what our specific concrete goals are.
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:23.480]   Okay, now that we have that goal,
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:26.600]   let's give ourselves some opportunity to energize.
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:29.120]   What is the outcome we hope to achieve
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:30.960]   if we fulfill that goal?
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:33.320]   And what that's doing is giving us this motivation now,
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:37.840]   really energizing us to pursue it even further.
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:41.760]   Okay, we've got the outcome, but now let's get realistic.
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:42.600]   What are the obstacles?
[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:45.520]   What are the internal obstacles that might prevent me
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:47.480]   from achieving those goals?
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:49.960]   Right, so let's say my wish is to be more present
[02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:51.900]   with my family after work.
[02:39:51.900 --> 02:39:53.640]   The outcome that I hope to achieve
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:58.640]   is to be a better father, a better husband,
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:02.280]   to have a richer social life in those regards.
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:03.320]   Now, what are the obstacles?
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:05.920]   Okay, internal obstacles, I got plenty, right?
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:08.860]   Like the temptation to check my email
[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:11.400]   and get to inbox zero before the night is done.
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:13.320]   Or I love my science
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:15.360]   and I also wanna do some of that work.
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:19.200]   Or maybe I'm gonna get distracted by friends who call.
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:20.700]   All of those things are obstacles
[02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:24.120]   that might get in the way of me achieving the goal
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:25.960]   of being more present with my family.
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:30.800]   Now, the final step, let me come up with an if-then plan.
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:35.800]   If I'm tempted to check my email after seven or eight,
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:40.760]   then I'm gonna remind myself about how important it is
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:44.000]   to be a dad, so I'll do a little reframing.
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:47.000]   If someone calls after 9 p.m.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:50.640]   and I'm engaging in activity with my kids,
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.400]   then I'm gonna politely decline.
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:54.760]   And you can imagine coming up with all sorts of plans
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:57.000]   for different levels of sophistication.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.600]   What those if-then plans do
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:04.440]   is they try to make emotion regulation automatic
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:07.920]   because they identify a specific trigger,
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:09.920]   if, that's the if, if this happens,
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:13.520]   and then they pair that trigger with a response.
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:15.880]   If-then, if-then, you rehearse that.
[02:41:15.880 --> 02:41:18.820]   And this way, when the trigger occurs, boom.
[02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:20.520]   You don't have to stop and think, what should I do?
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:21.680]   How should I behave?
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:23.840]   You've got the plan and you implement it.
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:26.760]   I've got if-then plans for chatter.
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:28.280]   If the chatter strikes,
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:31.760]   then I do distant self-talk and mental time travel.
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:34.320]   If the chatter is too overwhelming
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:35.800]   and those two tools don't work,
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:38.200]   then I go to nature and I go to my chatter advisors.
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:40.840]   And so I have these if-then plans
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:42.920]   that are linked up with my goals.
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:45.220]   And that's an important technology
[02:41:45.220 --> 02:41:48.640]   that I think we can invite people
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:51.500]   to try to exercise in their own lives
[02:41:51.500 --> 02:41:53.100]   to make it more likely
[02:41:53.100 --> 02:41:55.640]   that they will achieve their regulatory goals.
[02:41:55.640 --> 02:41:56.480]   - I love it.
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:41:59.360]   So WOOP, spelled W-O-O-P.
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:03.280]   The W, if I have this correct, is what's the goal?
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:04.240]   - What's your wish?
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:06.040]   - What's your wish?
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:10.000]   The first O is the opportunity to energize yourself
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:13.920]   around achieving that wish, AKA motivation.
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:15.560]   - That's right, what's the outcome you hope to achieve?
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:16.960]   Yep. - Great.
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:19.920]   Okay, even better 'cause of what you said was shorter.
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:23.180]   The first O is what's the outcome you hope to achieve?
[02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:26.520]   The second O, what are the obstacles you can anticipate?
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:27.360]   - That's right.
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:28.180]   And in the research space,
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:30.560]   it's mostly been personal obstacles,
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:35.120]   but you can generalize out as the Navy SEALs do.
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:37.040]   As an example, that's the branch of the military
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:40.400]   I was referring to that essentially uses
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:42.640]   a similar kind of framework to,
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:45.480]   now you have me self-conscious
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:47.520]   about using the word optimize,
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:52.520]   to optimize the way they respond to missions and challenges.
[02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:53.880]   This is what they,
[02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:56.320]   so they're not only dealing with internal obstacles,
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:58.840]   obviously, but also ones from the world around them.
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:01.060]   - Don't worry about using the word optimize.
[02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:02.320]   You did it optimally,
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:04.840]   and we'll soon squelch any pejorative
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:07.280]   around optimize during this episode.
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:11.360]   And then the P in WOOP is the plan, an if-then plan.
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:12.200]   - That's right.
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:15.040]   - So it's not a vague plan, it's a very specific plan
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:17.520]   so that you know exactly which strategies
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:20.920]   and steps to implement should A occur, B occur, C occur.
[02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:21.760]   - That's right.
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:24.280]   And so it's a general framework,
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:27.200]   which in part is, I think, why it has so much value.
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:28.480]   And there's research behind this
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:31.880]   showing it can help people achieve various kinds of goals.
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:34.760]   Now, there, of course, will be many situations
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:37.840]   that you have not developed WOOPs for.
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:39.960]   And that's okay because you're gonna have
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:42.240]   all of these other tools in your toolbox
[02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:46.640]   to manage those situations on the fly when they occur.
[02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:48.720]   But then once you encounter new situations
[02:43:48.720 --> 02:43:52.000]   and you discover what tools are effective,
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:53.720]   then you learn, you create your WOOP,
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:55.360]   and then you could become more strategic,
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:57.100]   automatic, and effortless
[02:43:57.100 --> 02:43:59.560]   with how you engage them down the road.
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:02.800]   - Earlier, you mentioned attentional spotlights,
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:05.080]   and I'm fascinated by this.
[02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:07.480]   I know that most people hear that we can't multitask,
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:10.480]   but primates, again, of which we are,
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:14.760]   old world primates in particular can do covert attention.
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:17.400]   If I were not completely focused on you,
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:19.440]   I could focus an attentional spotlight on you
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:20.860]   and your voice and pay attention to you,
[02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:23.200]   but I could also monitor components of the room.
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:25.720]   I can merge those spotlights.
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:27.760]   I can divorce those spotlights.
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:30.840]   But it's very hard to generate three
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:34.200]   kind of compatible attentional spotlights at once.
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:36.320]   It seems like we kind of have two.
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:38.480]   Maybe some people can manage three,
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:41.360]   but I'm betting most people can't manage more than three.
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:44.120]   - Well, and I think it becomes especially difficult
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:46.860]   to manage even one when you're experiencing
[02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:49.280]   an emotional episode
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:53.240]   that is essentially hijacking your attention.
[02:44:53.240 --> 02:44:55.000]   And attention's really important
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.460]   to talk about for a few reasons.
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:59.040]   So number one, as a species,
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:00.360]   we have the most sophisticated
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:03.600]   attention deployment system on the planet, right?
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:08.440]   We have the ability to strategically deploy our attention.
[02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:12.120]   So we can willfully place it on the things we want
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:14.280]   or yank it away from the things we don't want,
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:18.600]   or we can saccade our attention back and forth.
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:20.340]   When it comes to emotion, though,
[02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:22.640]   we are often taught certain maxims
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:24.920]   about how to deploy our attention
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:27.360]   that I think can sometimes be problematic
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:31.080]   because they fall into the category
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:36.080]   of prescriptive advice about magic pills.
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:37.860]   So often we hear, for example,
[02:45:37.860 --> 02:45:42.260]   that when it comes to chatter or really big emotions,
[02:45:42.260 --> 02:45:44.880]   things that you're anxious about or fearful,
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:47.160]   you should not avoid the problem.
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:49.520]   You should focus on it.
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:52.040]   And there's been a lot of research on this.
[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:53.540]   And what we have learned is on the one hand,
[02:45:53.540 --> 02:45:56.900]   chronically avoiding things is not good.
[02:45:56.900 --> 02:45:59.040]   It's associated with all sorts of negative outcomes
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:00.160]   for our emotional lives
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:03.560]   and beyond our physical lives too, our health.
[02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:08.620]   But oftentimes the signature for adaptively coping
[02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:10.860]   with emotional curve balls
[02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:14.340]   is being able to focus on the problem at hand,
[02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:17.020]   deploy your attention elsewhere, take a break,
[02:46:17.020 --> 02:46:17.860]   and then come back to it.
[02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:19.940]   And so this was a question actually I learned
[02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:22.200]   from my grandmother inadvertently.
[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:24.300]   My grandmother was this very interesting woman
[02:46:24.300 --> 02:46:29.300]   who grew up in Poland during World War II,
[02:46:29.300 --> 02:46:32.260]   had her entire family slaughtered during the war.
[02:46:32.260 --> 02:46:34.720]   One of these kind of devastating experiences,
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:38.680]   lived in the forest for years, back and forth,
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:41.400]   all this terrible stuff, family massacred and so forth.
[02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:44.360]   And growing up, she made it out of the war,
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:45.640]   moved to the States.
[02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:48.120]   I remember being just so exceptionally curious
[02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:50.960]   about what she experienced
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:53.120]   and how she was able to overcome it.
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:55.880]   And whenever I would ask her questions about this,
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:47:00.480]   she would always say, don't ask me why or what happened,
[02:47:00.480 --> 02:47:02.220]   why is a crooked letter?
[02:47:02.220 --> 02:47:03.560]   That was a phrase she would use,
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:04.480]   which was really interesting
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:07.080]   'cause she didn't speak English very well at all,
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:08.520]   heavily accented language,
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:11.840]   but she'd mastered this curious idiom,
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:13.280]   like why is a crooked letter?
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:17.720]   In other words, nothing good comes from dredging up
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:20.520]   the past or really trying to understand things.
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:23.160]   Your life is awesome, you're in a safe place,
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:25.080]   you have a loving family, just enjoy life.
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:26.940]   So she's trying to shelter me.
[02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:30.840]   So she, for most of the time that I would know her
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:31.680]   during the year,
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:36.340]   she would never focus on this horrific event
[02:47:36.340 --> 02:47:37.180]   that she experienced.
[02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:39.020]   Except one day a year,
[02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:42.100]   there would be this remembrance day
[02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:46.100]   and we'd all pile into a synagogue and we'd talk about,
[02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:48.820]   or I would listen to them talk about their experiences
[02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:52.740]   and the emotions would come out.
[02:47:52.740 --> 02:47:57.740]   So she would dose her exposure to the emotional information.
[02:47:57.740 --> 02:48:00.560]   Turns out what she was doing is she was being strategic
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:03.220]   in how she deployed her attention.
[02:48:03.220 --> 02:48:06.220]   She was focusing on the emotional issue at times
[02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:07.580]   when it was productive for her,
[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:10.520]   but at other times when it didn't serve her well,
[02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:12.020]   she occupied her attention
[02:48:12.020 --> 02:48:15.700]   with other kinds of thoughts and experiences.
[02:48:15.700 --> 02:48:19.000]   And a large literature is now beginning to emerge,
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:23.000]   which shows that this capacity to be flexible
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:24.520]   in how we wield our attention
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:27.640]   when it comes to sources of emotional struggles
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:30.040]   can be a really, really useful asset.
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:32.920]   And so I think it's important to remind folks
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:35.840]   that these blunt prescriptions
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:38.520]   to like always approach a thing, a problem,
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:41.320]   or always avoid it, they aren't always true.
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:45.680]   And that often the magic that surrounds emotion regulation,
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:47.720]   I mean the magic, not supernaturally,
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:51.360]   but the beauty surrounding it is in being really facile
[02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:53.160]   in how we can deploy our attention.
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:57.240]   - Really appreciate you sharing that personal anecdote.
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:48:59.960]   I've long struggled with the fact
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:03.500]   that so many of the sayings that were fed,
[02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:07.720]   like absence makes the heart grow fonder.
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:10.040]   Oh yeah, well, I also heard out of sight, out of mind.
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:10.880]   So which one is it?
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:11.720]   - That's right.
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:13.760]   - And that's why eventually I became a scientist.
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:14.680]   - That's right.
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:16.600]   - Because it's both, right?
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:19.440]   And you can see this in the fields
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:21.080]   of nutrition and exercise.
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:23.000]   I mean, there are certain core truths
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000]   and I think the goal is always to get to those core truths.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.360]   And then there's some flexibility around those truths,
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:28.580]   there's margins of error.
[02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:32.440]   I love what she shared, why is it a crooked letter?
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:35.360]   It reminds me of the Bob Dylan, like don't look back.
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:36.200]   - Yeah.
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:39.200]   - I mean, these are profound questions, right?
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:42.480]   Like how much of our consciousness should we use
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:46.000]   to enforce that we don't spend time thinking about the past
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:47.640]   and therefore miss out on the present
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:49.600]   and creating a best possible future.
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:52.680]   And yet we don't want elements from the past
[02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:55.200]   to kind of ferret into our psyche
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:56.920]   and then show up in ways that are destructive.
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:59.600]   So it's a complicated dance.
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:01.240]   - Oh, I mean, our emotional lives
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:03.000]   are anything but straightforward,
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:07.520]   but we do have guideposts to steer us
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:09.520]   in how we deploy our attention.
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:13.920]   And so a couple of common heuristics
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:17.740]   that I like to use and describe to folks is,
[02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:20.480]   so let's say something bad happens
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:23.520]   and you divert your attention away,
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:25.600]   you distract with a positive distraction,
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:27.240]   not a harmful distraction.
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:31.360]   And then the problem doesn't resurface, keep going.
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:32.920]   Like you don't have to go back in time.
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:35.280]   There's actually, I experienced some friction
[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:37.720]   sometimes with my dad around this issue.
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:42.720]   So my parents were divorced and I dealt with the baggage
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:45.800]   surrounding that experience earlier in my life.
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:48.520]   And when I think about it now, I don't get upset.
[02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:50.620]   Like I understand why it happened.
[02:50:50.620 --> 02:50:52.560]   I love both of my parents.
[02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:54.720]   I've moved on, I'm well-adjusted.
[02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:58.480]   But my dad likes to talk about this a lot whenever we speak
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:00.680]   and he will often bring it up.
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:02.040]   And when he does, I'm like,
[02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:03.680]   well, we don't have to talk about it.
[02:51:03.680 --> 02:51:05.200]   I'm actually totally fine.
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:08.120]   This isn't a source of ongoing distress.
[02:51:08.120 --> 02:51:12.200]   Sometimes we're able to make sense of what has happened to us
[02:51:12.200 --> 02:51:13.280]   and move on with our lives.
[02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:14.480]   And when that happens,
[02:51:14.480 --> 02:51:20.600]   that's our cognitive machinery operating really, really well.
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:24.120]   We don't have to go back and revisit every single thing.
[02:51:24.120 --> 02:51:25.640]   If on the other hand,
[02:51:25.640 --> 02:51:28.600]   we are trying to get a mental break, we're distracting,
[02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:31.600]   and we find thoughts about these experiences
[02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:33.960]   continually intruding into our awareness
[02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:36.400]   and being distracting, that is then a cue.
[02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:38.520]   Okay, well, let's focus in on it.
[02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:40.160]   And then once you focus in on it,
[02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:41.840]   of course there are multiple ways
[02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:45.200]   you can engage with that experience.
[02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:48.280]   Sometimes just bathing yourself in the emotional pain
[02:51:48.280 --> 02:51:51.640]   can be useful for facilitating a kind of
[02:51:51.640 --> 02:51:53.280]   what we would call habituation.
[02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:55.200]   So getting used to the discomfort
[02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:57.260]   and realizing it's not so bad
[02:51:57.260 --> 02:51:59.780]   to be in the presence of those negative thoughts.
[02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:02.640]   Maybe you wanna reframe how you think about the circumstance
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:05.280]   and we have wonderful cognitive apparatus
[02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:06.640]   to help us reframe things.
[02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:08.280]   We can look at it from different perspectives.
[02:52:08.280 --> 02:52:10.340]   We can focus on the silver lining.
[02:52:10.340 --> 02:52:12.040]   We can contextualize it.
[02:52:12.040 --> 02:52:14.380]   So you have lots of tools to engage with things
[02:52:14.380 --> 02:52:16.120]   once you refocus,
[02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:20.080]   but you don't always need to refocus on the problem.
[02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:22.160]   So you wanna be flexible.
[02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:24.620]   Flexibility and how you deploy your attention
[02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:28.540]   is really the mantra that I personally live by
[02:52:28.540 --> 02:52:31.340]   based on what I know of how all of this works.
[02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:34.760]   There are a couple of caveats I wanna throw out there.
[02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:37.460]   When I'm talking about distraction and avoiding,
[02:52:37.460 --> 02:52:41.000]   I'm talking about healthy distractions, healthy avoidance.
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:44.940]   There are unhealthier forms of avoidance
[02:52:44.940 --> 02:52:49.060]   that we know definitively are not productive,
[02:52:49.060 --> 02:52:50.380]   like substance abuse.
[02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:53.320]   We also know that if you adopt a blunt rule
[02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:57.300]   of always just chronically avoiding, not good.
[02:52:57.300 --> 02:52:58.620]   So you wanna be balanced.
[02:52:58.620 --> 02:53:03.820]   - Could we add to the list of tools for avoidance
[02:53:03.820 --> 02:53:04.920]   that tend to be unhealthy?
[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:06.740]   And this isn't one that I default to,
[02:53:06.740 --> 02:53:08.340]   but I know someone that told me
[02:53:08.340 --> 02:53:13.340]   that she used to default into over-consumption of story,
[02:53:13.340 --> 02:53:17.980]   like of audio books, not that audio books are bad,
[02:53:17.980 --> 02:53:19.540]   but of fiction audio books,
[02:53:19.540 --> 02:53:21.380]   and just kind of when there was a problem
[02:53:21.380 --> 02:53:23.420]   rather than dealing with the problem,
[02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:25.180]   overindulgence in narratives
[02:53:25.180 --> 02:53:26.660]   that would just kind of consume the mind.
[02:53:26.660 --> 02:53:29.820]   I guess any behavior where we're not dealing
[02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:33.180]   with the kind of itch that we probably need to scratch,
[02:53:33.180 --> 02:53:34.740]   at least for a short while,
[02:53:34.740 --> 02:53:38.100]   is probably gonna be maladaptive in the long run.
[02:53:38.100 --> 02:53:40.180]   - Yeah, I mean, if the problem keeps,
[02:53:40.180 --> 02:53:44.260]   like you wanna listen to what your mind
[02:53:44.260 --> 02:53:45.780]   and body are telling you.
[02:53:45.780 --> 02:53:48.260]   And so if you find that the problem keeps resurfacing,
[02:53:48.260 --> 02:53:51.400]   that's a cue you need to engage and deal with it.
[02:53:51.400 --> 02:53:54.740]   But a lot of the experiences we have on a daily basis,
[02:53:54.740 --> 02:53:58.420]   which may not be positive, negative experiences,
[02:53:58.420 --> 02:54:01.300]   as time moves on, sometimes that's all we need
[02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:03.420]   to keep going with our lives.
[02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:05.620]   And we do see in the literature
[02:54:05.620 --> 02:54:09.600]   that when you impose a particular view on folks,
[02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:12.220]   like you have to do it this way,
[02:54:12.220 --> 02:54:14.420]   that tends not to work out very well.
[02:54:14.420 --> 02:54:17.300]   - Most of what we've been discussing today
[02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:20.500]   is one's emotional life and experience
[02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:24.220]   and chatter and inner narratives with oneself
[02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:28.580]   and their environment, technology, nature,
[02:54:28.580 --> 02:54:30.340]   and to some extent, relationships.
[02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:33.700]   But one powerful aspect of emotions
[02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:35.660]   that I think a lot of people wonder about
[02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:37.320]   and frankly participate in
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:39.980]   is this notion of emotional contagion,
[02:54:39.980 --> 02:54:42.260]   both positive and negative.
[02:54:42.260 --> 02:54:44.500]   I think of like, you mentioned football.
[02:54:44.500 --> 02:54:46.020]   Football's big in Michigan, right?
[02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:46.860]   - Oh yeah.
[02:54:46.860 --> 02:54:47.740]   - I remember from the movie "The Big Chill,"
[02:54:47.740 --> 02:54:49.620]   they actually go out and play football.
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:52.100]   I think they were all alum of University of Michigan.
[02:54:52.100 --> 02:54:54.460]   - It's a religion in the city that I live in.
[02:54:54.460 --> 02:54:55.300]   That's right. - Is it, right?
[02:54:55.300 --> 02:54:56.860]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[02:54:56.860 --> 02:54:59.340]   And how many people go to one of these games?
[02:54:59.340 --> 02:55:00.860]   - So we actually, it's called the Big House,
[02:55:00.860 --> 02:55:04.440]   actually the largest football stadium in the country.
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:06.460]   So close to 110,000.
[02:55:06.460 --> 02:55:08.380]   - Whoa, that's a lot of people.
[02:55:08.380 --> 02:55:11.060]   - It's a lot of people and we sing in unison.
[02:55:11.060 --> 02:55:14.180]   And it's actually, I never really was into football
[02:55:14.180 --> 02:55:17.160]   before moving to Ann Arbor and now I embrace it.
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:20.260]   It helps when you're the national championships,
[02:55:20.260 --> 02:55:23.660]   which we were champions, which we were last year.
[02:55:23.660 --> 02:55:24.760]   - Congratulations.
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:26.980]   - We're working on it this year.
[02:55:26.980 --> 02:55:28.380]   - Cool, maybe sometime I'll go to a game.
[02:55:28.380 --> 02:55:32.020]   I don't dislike football, I like football.
[02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:33.300]   I don't think I've ever been
[02:55:33.300 --> 02:55:35.140]   to a professional football game.
[02:55:35.140 --> 02:55:36.740]   - We should definitely have you out there.
[02:55:36.740 --> 02:55:38.100]   It is a load of fun.
[02:55:38.100 --> 02:55:41.300]   - Okay, I'll skip one game of the Globe Trotter season
[02:55:41.300 --> 02:55:44.120]   to go to a Michigan game.
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:48.300]   Emotional contagion occurs in football stadiums.
[02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:50.500]   It occurs in digesting news.
[02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:51.500]   We just had an election.
[02:55:51.500 --> 02:55:53.340]   So a lot of emotional contagion
[02:55:53.340 --> 02:55:56.180]   in essentially opposite directions, post-election.
[02:55:56.180 --> 02:55:59.140]   And on and on.
[02:55:59.140 --> 02:56:02.700]   What do we know about emotional contagion?
[02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:05.900]   It makes sense to me why we would be so prone to it,
[02:56:05.900 --> 02:56:10.600]   but where are the sort of rumble strips,
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:16.860]   so to speak, and the ditch on emotional contagion?
[02:56:16.860 --> 02:56:17.980]   That's a driving analogy.
[02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:19.740]   The rumble strips are the goo-goo-goo-goo-goo
[02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:22.040]   that when you start to drift towards the ditch.
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:24.980]   Obviously the ditch is losing control
[02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:26.780]   in the negative direction, maladaptive direction.
[02:56:26.780 --> 02:56:30.260]   But how can we start to identify the rumble strips
[02:56:30.260 --> 02:56:31.660]   in emotional contagion?
[02:56:31.660 --> 02:56:34.660]   - Yeah, so emotional contagion is a very powerful phenomenon.
[02:56:34.660 --> 02:56:38.880]   Emotions can spread within seconds.
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:43.260]   We tend to catch emotions more quickly
[02:56:43.260 --> 02:56:46.940]   when we're not sure of how we should be thinking
[02:56:46.940 --> 02:56:48.900]   or feeling in a particular situation.
[02:56:48.900 --> 02:56:51.940]   So we often are referencing other people
[02:56:51.940 --> 02:56:55.500]   in those instances as a source of information.
[02:56:55.500 --> 02:56:57.180]   The people around us, of course,
[02:56:57.180 --> 02:56:59.140]   are a rich source of information.
[02:56:59.140 --> 02:57:00.740]   This is also why we compare ourselves
[02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:02.540]   to other people so frequently.
[02:57:02.540 --> 02:57:05.820]   We're trying to learn something about how to respond.
[02:57:05.820 --> 02:57:08.300]   And we know it can have these cascading effects,
[02:57:08.300 --> 02:57:11.220]   both in everyday life, in both the positive
[02:57:11.220 --> 02:57:13.220]   and the negative direction.
[02:57:13.220 --> 02:57:18.220]   But also, in the digital world,
[02:57:18.220 --> 02:57:21.500]   we see these emotions that can spread really fast too.
[02:57:21.500 --> 02:57:23.860]   So it's a very powerful phenomenon.
[02:57:23.860 --> 02:57:26.980]   It's what I'm often very attentive to
[02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:29.180]   when I come into the classroom.
[02:57:29.180 --> 02:57:32.900]   Like you're trying to, you tend to not wanna have
[02:57:32.900 --> 02:57:35.080]   a negative mood spread through an audience
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:36.260]   when you are teaching to them.
[02:57:36.260 --> 02:57:39.160]   And so you're sensitive to that kind of,
[02:57:39.160 --> 02:57:41.060]   certain kinds of displays or tones
[02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:44.620]   that might convey that kind of emotional response.
[02:57:44.620 --> 02:57:47.340]   And I think it's something that we need
[02:57:47.340 --> 02:57:49.100]   to be increasingly aware of,
[02:57:49.100 --> 02:57:53.140]   especially when we're working in any kind of group context.
[02:57:53.140 --> 02:57:55.300]   Like when you're working in a team,
[02:57:55.300 --> 02:57:58.420]   it is really important to keep the team
[02:57:58.420 --> 02:58:02.820]   at the level of emotional tone that you feel
[02:58:02.820 --> 02:58:06.420]   if you're the leader or even just a member of this team
[02:58:06.420 --> 02:58:07.700]   that is committed to it.
[02:58:07.700 --> 02:58:10.980]   You wanna keep that tone at the most productive level
[02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:13.940]   because if it dips below or above,
[02:58:13.940 --> 02:58:18.940]   that can sabotage how well you perform.
[02:58:18.940 --> 02:58:20.780]   And there's a lot of research on that.
[02:58:20.780 --> 02:58:23.300]   - Both from directing my laboratory
[02:58:23.300 --> 02:58:25.660]   for a good number of years and from teaching
[02:58:25.660 --> 02:58:26.940]   and from certainly the podcast,
[02:58:26.940 --> 02:58:29.140]   which is a small team of seven of us,
[02:58:29.140 --> 02:58:31.500]   I'm familiar with what you just described.
[02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:34.460]   And also from being a camp counselor.
[02:58:34.460 --> 02:58:35.620]   That's probably where I learned it,
[02:58:35.620 --> 02:58:38.100]   being a summer camp counselor when I was in college.
[02:58:38.100 --> 02:58:42.220]   That if you get two or three kids
[02:58:42.220 --> 02:58:44.500]   that are like really pissed off about what you have to do
[02:58:44.500 --> 02:58:46.180]   over the next couple of hours,
[02:58:46.180 --> 02:58:49.180]   it can send everything south.
[02:58:49.180 --> 02:58:50.820]   - You have to nip that in the bud right away.
[02:58:50.820 --> 02:58:52.500]   You have to repair that.
[02:58:52.500 --> 02:58:55.620]   And I'm very, very attentive to this
[02:58:55.620 --> 02:58:57.780]   when I am in group context,
[02:58:57.780 --> 02:58:59.860]   especially when I'm leading those groups,
[02:58:59.860 --> 02:59:01.060]   those teams, those labs.
[02:59:01.060 --> 02:59:04.260]   Like really making sure that that kind of negative mojo
[02:59:04.260 --> 02:59:06.820]   does not spread.
[02:59:06.820 --> 02:59:09.860]   - Do you think nowadays on university campuses,
[02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:14.020]   there's more of a tendency for students to raise their hands
[02:59:14.020 --> 02:59:16.340]   and say, "Let's spark an issue."
[02:59:16.340 --> 02:59:18.900]   And I'll just preface this by saying,
[02:59:18.900 --> 02:59:21.460]   a guy that I worked for as an undergraduate,
[02:59:21.460 --> 02:59:26.580]   a physiologist, he told me that when he was teaching
[02:59:26.580 --> 02:59:28.020]   during the Vietnam War era,
[02:59:28.020 --> 02:59:29.500]   he would be in the middle of a lecture
[02:59:29.500 --> 02:59:33.420]   about cold thermogenesis physiology, his area of expertise.
[02:59:33.420 --> 02:59:35.540]   And someone would just stand up and say,
[02:59:35.540 --> 02:59:37.620]   "What about the war in Vietnam?"
[02:59:37.620 --> 02:59:39.140]   And I remember him telling me that story.
[02:59:39.140 --> 02:59:40.020]   I thought, "That's outrageous."
[02:59:40.020 --> 02:59:40.660]   Like, "Really?"
[02:59:40.660 --> 02:59:42.340]   And he said, "Oh yeah, all the time."
[02:59:42.340 --> 02:59:44.820]   And you would have to stop and have to acknowledge it
[02:59:44.820 --> 02:59:46.180]   and let them have their expression.
[02:59:46.180 --> 02:59:47.700]   I thought, "Well, that's wild."
[02:59:47.700 --> 02:59:52.100]   Now we're living in times when that's not all that unusual
[02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:56.660]   in the university classroom and on campuses and online.
[02:59:56.660 --> 02:59:59.220]   So it was interesting that that previous example
[02:59:59.220 --> 03:00:03.700]   from the 1960s and '70s is now very relevant again.
[03:00:03.700 --> 03:00:06.820]   So do we let people emote?
[03:00:06.820 --> 03:00:11.780]   Or as a summer camp counselor, someone pulled me aside
[03:00:11.780 --> 03:00:13.780]   and said, "These kids have a lot of energy.
[03:00:13.780 --> 03:00:16.180]   My only advice is be a channel, not a dam."
[03:00:16.180 --> 03:00:17.540]   - Yeah. - Something that I never forgot.
[03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:18.420]   - Yeah. - It's very useful
[03:00:18.420 --> 03:00:21.060]   in other areas of life to be a channel, not a dam.
[03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:23.860]   - Yeah. - So how do you be a channel,
[03:00:23.860 --> 03:00:26.740]   not a dam when people are having really,
[03:00:26.740 --> 03:00:31.620]   having the need to externalize negative stuff
[03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:34.180]   and it holds the potential for emotional contagion?
[03:00:34.180 --> 03:00:38.420]   - Well, I haven't experienced firsthand the phenomenon
[03:00:38.420 --> 03:00:39.860]   that you're describing in the classroom,
[03:00:39.860 --> 03:00:41.700]   but obviously a lot of my colleagues have,
[03:00:41.700 --> 03:00:43.860]   and we see this playing out on lots of universities.
[03:00:43.860 --> 03:00:45.860]   These are very turbulent times.
[03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:48.660]   Turbulence activates emotion.
[03:00:48.660 --> 03:00:51.620]   And we know going back to an earlier part
[03:00:51.620 --> 03:00:54.500]   of our conversation when people experience strong emotions
[03:00:54.500 --> 03:00:56.740]   are often motivated to share those emotions
[03:00:56.740 --> 03:00:57.940]   with other people.
[03:00:57.940 --> 03:01:00.020]   That often takes the form of vocalizing them.
[03:01:00.660 --> 03:01:02.740]   And that can elicit contagion throughout.
[03:01:02.740 --> 03:01:04.980]   And so now we're beginning to actually understand
[03:01:04.980 --> 03:01:08.500]   how the emotional processes are making their way
[03:01:08.500 --> 03:01:11.780]   through people, groups, and societies.
[03:01:11.780 --> 03:01:16.340]   What should you do in those circumstances?
[03:01:16.340 --> 03:01:19.540]   Well, I think it depends a lot on the context
[03:01:19.540 --> 03:01:22.980]   and what the nature of the emotional response is.
[03:01:22.980 --> 03:01:27.300]   And are there, is the emotion becoming really
[03:01:28.500 --> 03:01:30.820]   counterproductive or harmful?
[03:01:30.820 --> 03:01:32.980]   And there are differing views about
[03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:36.020]   when you should intervene and how to do it.
[03:01:36.020 --> 03:01:40.580]   I think in general though, you bring the playbook
[03:01:40.580 --> 03:01:44.660]   of always wanting to kind of validate
[03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:48.420]   like your emotional experience is a genuine response
[03:01:48.420 --> 03:01:51.060]   that you are having to the situation.
[03:01:51.060 --> 03:01:55.460]   In most cases, yes, we can try to purposefully experience
[03:01:55.460 --> 03:01:57.220]   an emotion in a duplicitous way.
[03:01:57.220 --> 03:01:59.220]   But I think in a lot of cases,
[03:01:59.220 --> 03:02:00.820]   the kinds of phenomenon we're talking about,
[03:02:00.820 --> 03:02:03.940]   like these are just honest emotional reactions.
[03:02:03.940 --> 03:02:05.540]   These are really difficult times.
[03:02:05.540 --> 03:02:09.380]   And I think trying to understand
[03:02:09.380 --> 03:02:11.460]   where those emotions are coming from
[03:02:11.460 --> 03:02:13.860]   is often a really great first step.
[03:02:13.860 --> 03:02:15.940]   I mentioned to you before we started talking
[03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:20.100]   that I had this wonderful conflict mediator
[03:02:20.100 --> 03:02:22.900]   come to one of my classes recently to talk about
[03:02:22.900 --> 03:02:26.820]   how do you not just engage with emotional groups,
[03:02:26.820 --> 03:02:29.860]   but how do you engage with emotional groups
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:32.260]   at the same time that are having emotions
[03:02:32.260 --> 03:02:33.940]   because of one another?
[03:02:33.940 --> 03:02:36.100]   And the approach that she has found
[03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:40.020]   to be very successful in her career as a mediator
[03:02:40.020 --> 03:02:42.900]   is to ask folks, to train them,
[03:02:42.900 --> 03:02:45.140]   not to enter conversations
[03:02:45.140 --> 03:02:47.140]   to try to change each other's minds,
[03:02:47.140 --> 03:02:50.020]   but to enter those conversations
[03:02:50.020 --> 03:02:54.820]   with a state of humility and curiosity and genuine interest
[03:02:54.820 --> 03:02:57.540]   and in first and foremost, trying to just understand
[03:02:57.540 --> 03:02:59.460]   the other group's position.
[03:02:59.460 --> 03:03:00.660]   I haven't done that myself,
[03:03:00.660 --> 03:03:05.220]   but it strikes me as a pretty viable approach
[03:03:05.220 --> 03:03:09.300]   to a first step to having conversations
[03:03:09.300 --> 03:03:10.260]   about difficult issues.
[03:03:10.260 --> 03:03:14.340]   And it makes me think about how in the lab,
[03:03:14.340 --> 03:03:17.620]   we often define wisdom.
[03:03:17.620 --> 03:03:22.260]   So wisdom is this concept of,
[03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:25.140]   it indexes how well you are able to deal with
[03:03:25.140 --> 03:03:28.660]   social situations involving uncertainty.
[03:03:28.660 --> 03:03:30.660]   Like we don't know how these social situations
[03:03:30.660 --> 03:03:31.700]   are gonna play out
[03:03:31.700 --> 03:03:34.180]   and wise individuals are skillful
[03:03:34.180 --> 03:03:36.500]   in navigating those circumstances.
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:37.780]   How do you define wisdom?
[03:03:37.780 --> 03:03:39.140]   What are its features?
[03:03:39.140 --> 03:03:42.100]   Well, a few of its core features are humility,
[03:03:42.100 --> 03:03:44.500]   recognizing that I don't know everything,
[03:03:44.500 --> 03:03:46.740]   a commitment to perspective taking,
[03:03:46.740 --> 03:03:48.660]   putting myself in the other person's shoes,
[03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:52.420]   dialecticism, recognizing that the world
[03:03:52.420 --> 03:03:55.540]   is constantly in flux and circumstances are changing
[03:03:55.540 --> 03:03:58.500]   and we need to be aware of that.
[03:03:58.500 --> 03:04:00.740]   And then also a general orientation
[03:04:00.740 --> 03:04:02.980]   towards the social good,
[03:04:02.980 --> 03:04:04.420]   like doing good in the world.
[03:04:04.420 --> 03:04:08.020]   And it strikes me that entering these difficult situations
[03:04:08.020 --> 03:04:10.020]   with that kind of mindset
[03:04:10.020 --> 03:04:14.500]   is potentially productive for bridging divides.
[03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:16.500]   - I love that.
[03:04:16.500 --> 03:04:21.460]   And what an appropriate area for us to round up in.
[03:04:21.460 --> 03:04:24.020]   I think that right now, clearly things are tense,
[03:04:24.020 --> 03:04:27.140]   but what you've talked about today,
[03:04:27.140 --> 03:04:29.060]   and at least from what I understand
[03:04:29.060 --> 03:04:31.460]   of how the human mind works in and around emotions,
[03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:35.860]   our own and observing others and potentially contagion
[03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:39.380]   is that these tools can really help us do better.
[03:04:39.380 --> 03:04:42.420]   That they're not just research papers,
[03:04:42.420 --> 03:04:47.060]   they are implementable chunks of knowledge.
[03:04:47.060 --> 03:04:49.540]   And in some cases, such as what you've discussed today,
[03:04:49.540 --> 03:04:50.260]   real gems.
[03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:53.140]   So for that reason,
[03:04:53.140 --> 03:04:55.140]   and for taking the time out of your research schedule,
[03:04:55.140 --> 03:04:56.660]   I mean, you're a researcher, teacher,
[03:04:56.660 --> 03:04:57.620]   you're a dad, you're a husband,
[03:04:57.620 --> 03:04:58.740]   you do many things.
[03:04:58.740 --> 03:05:00.100]   You make it to football games somehow,
[03:05:00.100 --> 03:05:02.660]   also into the gym where you don't drop dumbbells
[03:05:02.660 --> 03:05:04.580]   on people's faces intentionally
[03:05:04.580 --> 03:05:06.580]   because you realize the dire consequences.
[03:05:06.580 --> 03:05:09.380]   You're just doing a ton of amazing work in the world.
[03:05:09.380 --> 03:05:11.860]   I'd heard about Enred Chatter some time ago,
[03:05:12.420 --> 03:05:15.140]   and I just think it's incredible
[03:05:15.140 --> 03:05:16.580]   what you've brought to people's attention
[03:05:16.580 --> 03:05:19.380]   that has always, no pun intended,
[03:05:19.380 --> 03:05:20.900]   been on and in their minds.
[03:05:20.900 --> 03:05:21.220]   - Yeah.
[03:05:21.220 --> 03:05:24.100]   - And I'm sure there are others in your field,
[03:05:24.100 --> 03:05:27.460]   but I want to specifically thank you
[03:05:27.460 --> 03:05:30.020]   on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching
[03:05:30.020 --> 03:05:33.540]   for paying so much careful research attention
[03:05:33.540 --> 03:05:35.700]   and public education attention
[03:05:35.700 --> 03:05:38.340]   to this thing that we call chatter
[03:05:38.340 --> 03:05:40.500]   and the inner voice and emotion regulation,
[03:05:40.500 --> 03:05:43.220]   because this is really what makes up our lives.
[03:05:43.220 --> 03:05:45.620]   It's as important in my mind,
[03:05:45.620 --> 03:05:47.540]   certainly as cardiovascular health
[03:05:47.540 --> 03:05:50.500]   or any other aspect of mental or physical health.
[03:05:50.500 --> 03:05:54.660]   So on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching,
[03:05:54.660 --> 03:05:55.540]   thank you so much.
[03:05:55.540 --> 03:05:57.060]   Please come back again
[03:05:57.060 --> 03:05:58.340]   because your research is evolving.
[03:05:58.340 --> 03:06:00.420]   We'd love to hear about the next steps.
[03:06:00.420 --> 03:06:02.340]   We'll definitely provide links to your work
[03:06:02.340 --> 03:06:03.460]   and to the upcoming book,
[03:06:03.460 --> 03:06:05.300]   which comes out in February of 2025.
[03:06:05.300 --> 03:06:06.740]   Do you want to tell us the title of the book?
[03:06:06.740 --> 03:06:07.380]   - That's right.
[03:06:07.380 --> 03:06:09.620]   It's called "Shift Managing Your Emotions
[03:06:09.620 --> 03:06:10.740]   So They Don't Manage You."
[03:06:10.740 --> 03:06:11.300]   - Great.
[03:06:11.300 --> 03:06:14.660]   And presumably it's available for presale now or soon?
[03:06:14.660 --> 03:06:16.260]   - Yeah, it's available.
[03:06:16.260 --> 03:06:20.740]   And it is essentially designed,
[03:06:20.740 --> 03:06:25.700]   it is written to kind of just open the book
[03:06:25.700 --> 03:06:26.900]   on what emotions are,
[03:06:26.900 --> 03:06:28.580]   what we often get wrong about them,
[03:06:28.580 --> 03:06:30.740]   and what are the tools that we have to reign them in.
[03:06:30.740 --> 03:06:35.300]   And my hope is that it addresses this big problem
[03:06:35.300 --> 03:06:37.060]   that I think we've been facing for a while,
[03:06:37.780 --> 03:06:39.220]   which is how to wrangle these emotions
[03:06:39.220 --> 03:06:40.580]   that sometimes get the best of us.
[03:06:40.580 --> 03:06:41.220]   - Great.
[03:06:41.220 --> 03:06:44.420]   Well, I am personally going to order a copy by presale.
[03:06:44.420 --> 03:06:45.380]   I insist on that.
[03:06:45.380 --> 03:06:46.580]   I don't take free copies.
[03:06:46.580 --> 03:06:49.540]   I buy books because I'm a believer in books.
[03:06:49.540 --> 03:06:50.980]   So thank you for writing "Shift"
[03:06:50.980 --> 03:06:52.900]   and come back and talk to us again.
[03:06:52.900 --> 03:06:53.860]   - Well, thanks for having me.
[03:06:53.860 --> 03:06:55.540]   It was an incredible conversation.
[03:06:55.540 --> 03:06:56.260]   So I appreciate it.
[03:06:56.260 --> 03:06:57.380]   - I feel the same way.
[03:06:57.380 --> 03:06:58.020]   Thank you so much.
[03:06:58.020 --> 03:06:58.420]   - Thank you.
[03:06:58.420 --> 03:07:00.980]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:07:00.980 --> 03:07:02.580]   with Dr. Ethan Cross.
[03:07:02.580 --> 03:07:04.500]   I hope you found it to be as informative
[03:07:04.500 --> 03:07:06.740]   and as actionable as I did.
[03:07:06.740 --> 03:07:08.660]   To learn more about Dr. Cross's work
[03:07:08.660 --> 03:07:11.060]   and to find links to his previous book, "Chatter,"
[03:07:11.060 --> 03:07:13.540]   as well as his forthcoming book, "Shift,"
[03:07:13.540 --> 03:07:16.580]   "Managing Your Emotions So They Do Not Manage You,"
[03:07:16.580 --> 03:07:18.420]   please see the show note captions.

[03:07:46.740 --> 03:07:48.900]   please put those in the comments section on YouTube.
[03:07:48.900 --> 03:07:50.580]   I do read all the comments.
[03:07:50.580 --> 03:07:53.060]   And if you're not already following me on social media,
[03:07:53.060 --> 03:07:56.020]   I am @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[03:07:56.020 --> 03:07:58.900]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:07:58.900 --> 03:08:00.740]   Facebook, LinkedIn, and Threads.
[03:08:00.740 --> 03:08:02.020]   And on all those platforms,
[03:08:02.020 --> 03:08:04.180]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:08:04.180 --> 03:08:05.700]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:08:05.700 --> 03:08:07.220]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:08:07.220 --> 03:08:09.220]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:08:09.220 --> 03:08:10.900]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:08:10.900 --> 03:08:14.180]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:08:14.180 --> 03:08:15.620]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[03:08:15.620 --> 03:08:17.460]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[03:08:17.460 --> 03:08:18.820]   the Neural Network newsletter
[03:08:18.820 --> 03:08:20.580]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[03:08:20.580 --> 03:08:22.740]   that includes everything from podcast summaries
[03:08:22.740 --> 03:08:26.180]   to protocols in the form of brief one to three-page PDFs.
[03:08:26.180 --> 03:08:28.020]   So these are protocols that describe
[03:08:28.020 --> 03:08:30.180]   the essential steps to take, for instance,
[03:08:30.180 --> 03:08:32.100]   to optimize your sleep,
[03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:34.500]   to improve your dopamine regulation,
[03:08:34.500 --> 03:08:37.140]   for deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure,
[03:08:37.140 --> 03:08:39.380]   all of which is available completely zero cost.
[03:08:39.380 --> 03:08:41.620]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[03:08:41.620 --> 03:08:43.060]   go to the menu tab in the corner,
[03:08:43.060 --> 03:08:45.140]   scroll down to newsletter and provide your email.
[03:08:45.140 --> 03:08:45.940]   And I should point out
[03:08:45.940 --> 03:08:48.500]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[03:08:48.500 --> 03:08:49.940]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:08:49.940 --> 03:08:52.820]   for today's discussion with Dr. Ethan Cross.
[03:08:52.820 --> 03:08:54.900]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:08:54.900 --> 03:08:57.300]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:08:57.300 --> 03:08:59.880]   (upbeat music)
[03:08:59.880 --> 03:09:02.460]   (upbeat music)
