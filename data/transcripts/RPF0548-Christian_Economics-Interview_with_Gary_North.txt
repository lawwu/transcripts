[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:11.400]   I've looked forward to this conversation since we scheduled it because you have an extremely unique story which is of interest to me.

[00:10:47.020 --> 00:11:14.020]   in the middle of the year. So that may be an example of Parkinson's law that is work expands so as to fill the time allotted for its completion. But it was rather remarkable that the project in fact did take all of the last three weeks of that initial scheduling which I'd done in 1976. I'm sorry it was a little later I think it was I think it was three weeks before I turned 70.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:43.120]  , I think it was I think it was 70, 70, maybe 77 but it was it was a long period of time. And along the way my understanding is you wrote was it 31 volumes of commentary and perhaps six or seven supporting books that weren't specifically passage by passage commentary to arrive at the source material for your capstone projects.

So again you have to look at the nature of the doctrine of cause and effect and the two countries, the two social orders, and they are very, very different social orders leading to different political orders leading to different political orders leading to different social orders.

[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:46.580]   So let me contrast that now with the United States of America, the per capita wealthiest country in the world, as my understanding at least. In the modern US American context, it would be relatively easy to draw the

So, do we take credit and say, "Well, we're rich because we're righteous in some way"? Do we look at, for example, I read a book on geography, the geography of the United States of America, people try to explain the wealth of the United States based upon that, or do we look to ethics?

Dealing with the Roman Empire, you don't take a guy into a judge who is part of a legal order that's corrupt. Is that true in a Christian social order? Paul wrote that before AD 70. In a Christian social order in which biblical laws enforced,

He's broken the law. Okay, here's how we do it. We create a thing called a corporation. And so corporations sue each other because they're not members of churches.
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:49.040]   But the financial results can be the same, basically, not much difference. You can create all kinds of ways around it,

[02:26:57.080 --> 02:26:59.080]   But the bottom line is this: thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Which means it isn't done that way yet.
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:26:59.080]   thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Which means it isn't done that way yet.
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:01.080]   Which means it isn't done that way yet. And so you pray that it will be done that way at some point.

[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:08.080]   And the amillennialist does not believe that can be fulfilled in history.
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:09.080]   And the amillennialist does not believe that can be fulfilled in history.
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:31.120]   And the premillennialist believes it can only be fulfilled in history when Jesus returns with the angels to set up an international top-down bureaucracy, probably with headquarters at Jerusalem, or if not Jerusalem, then Colorado Springs.

[02:27:37.140 --> 02:27:47.160]   So bringing it back then to the very example of Jesus, do you affirm or do you...
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:52.160]   Paul, when preaching about Jesus in Paul's letters, I can't cite the exact one off the top of my head, but Paul talks about how Jesus' death looked like a defeat and yet for God it was a victory.
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:53.160]   So bringing it back then to the very example of Jesus, do you affirm or do you...

[02:27:55.220 --> 02:28:17.200]  , Paul, when preaching about Jesus in Paul's letters, I can't cite the exact one off the top of my head, but Paul talks about how Jesus' death looked like a defeat and yet for God it was a victory.
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:18.200]   So what looked like defeat in Jesus' death on the cross was actually victory.
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:19.200]   So what looked like defeat in Jesus' death on the cross was actually victory.
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:20.200]   Did Jesus have victory or did he have defeat in history and how did that look?
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:21.200]   Did Jesus have victory or did he have defeat in history and how did that look?
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:23.200]   Did Jesus have victory or did he have defeat in history and how did that look?
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:24.200]   Did Jesus have victory or did he have defeat in history and how did that look?
[02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:25.200]   Did Jesus have victory or did he have defeat in history and how did that look?
[02:28:25.220 --> 02:28:29.240]   The question, so let me just clarify and allow you to respond.
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:37.240]   Sometimes I think what looks like success may not be a success.
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:43.240]   And here we could go through much of Christian history over the last 2,000 years and I think there are times, let me just use the example from our earlier conversation.
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:46.240]   And here we could go through much of Christian history over the last 2,000 years and I think there are times, let me just use the example from our earlier conversation.
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:47.240]   What looks like success in Mexico with a broad Catholic population, a significant, perhaps majority percentage of the people who would affirm the fact that Jesus was a victory, and that was not true.
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:48.240]   What looks like success in Mexico with a broad Catholic population, a significant, perhaps majority percentage of the people who would affirm the fact that Jesus was a victory.
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:49.240]   What looks like success in Mexico with a broad Catholic population, a significant, perhaps majority percentage of the people who would affirm the fact that Jesus was a victory.
[02:28:49.300 --> 02:29:15.280]  , in reality, based upon our earlier conversation, looks less successful than perhaps the less affirming society of Canada.
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:16.280]   , in reality, based upon our earlier conversation, looks less successful than perhaps the less affirming society of Canada.
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:17.280]   , in reality, based upon our earlier conversation, looks less successful than perhaps the less affirming society of Canada.
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:18.280]   So what looks like success sometimes may not actually be success.
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:19.280]   So what looks like success sometimes may not actually be success as in the example of Jesus.
[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:21.320]   Wait a minute!
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:22.320]   Go ahead.
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:23.320]   You're talking about the crucifixion.
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:24.320]   Correct.
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:25.320]   What about the resurrection?
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:26.320]   It was a success and it was clear and visible to all who saw Jesus.
[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:27.320]   It was a success and it was clear and visible to all who saw Jesus.
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:28.320]   And what about the ascension?
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:29.320]   A success.
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:30.320]   Clear and visible.
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:31.320]   Right.
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:32.320]   That's the pattern.
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:33.320]   That's the pattern.
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:34.320]   So thy will be done on earth or in earth, if you will.
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:35.320]   So thy will be done on earth or in earth, if you will.

You're dropping the text, man. Verse 10 of 1 Corinthians 7. Read that text. To the married, I give this charge, not I but the Lord. The wife should not be separated from the husband and she cannot remarry.
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:35:59.340]   Stop.
