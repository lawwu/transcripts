[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, I have a real treat for you. That is, if you are
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:13.680]   the type of person who enjoys challenging, involved conversations about difficult social
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.680]   topics, economic topics, and theological topics. If that's you, you'll like today's show.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:39.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.640]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.040]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua, and I am
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.960]   your host. I am your fellow financial freedom fighter. And today I am your interviewer as
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:08.000]   I welcome my interviewee, Dr. Gary North, to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.160]   I have threatened many times on the show over the past weeks and months to start bringing
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.080]   back more interviews to the show. Once upon a time, I would do two interviews per week,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.760]   and my intention is to bring you many more interviews. I have missed them, but I felt
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.120]   they were counterproductive for me given some of the things that I've had going on behind
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.160]   the scenes at Radical Personal Finance. But I intend to bring them back, and today we
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.800]   continue that process of bringing you more interviews on the show. And I'm excited to
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.640]   bring you this interview with Dr. Gary North. If you enjoy challenging discussions with
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.120]   complex topics, I think you'll really enjoy today's show. If you're looking for a simplistic
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.520]   discussion on just a couple of quick tips that you can do to make more money, skip this
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.400]   show. This one will not be for you. I will introduce Gary North in just a moment as I
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.640]   bring him on the show, but he is a force to be reckoned with, especially if you have any
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   interest in the areas of Christian economics. Now, of course, there are many Christians
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.200]   who have no interest in economics, and there are many economists who have no interest in
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.960]   Christianity. So the audience for people who are interested in Christian economics is quite
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.760]   small, but I don't think it should be. I think it should be quite large. And if you have
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.360]   any interest in these particular types of discussions, I think you will enjoy this.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   Dr. Gary North is one of the more challenging teachers in this area. He is a force to be
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.440]   reckoned with. For the last 50 plus years of his career, he has been a prolific contributor
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.920]   in this particular area. In fact, I know of almost no one else who has done what he has
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.560]   done, which is to verse by verse systematically exegete the entirety of the Christian Bible
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.800]   with a specific focus on understanding what it has to say about money and economics.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.240]   Trained as a historian, also a theologian, and also in the field of economics, I always find
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.200]   Dr. North's writing and his perspectives to be very, very challenging, and I've appreciated
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.520]   much of what he has written. I've intended to bring him on the show for a number of years,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.440]   but it was only in 2017 when he finally published some of his capstone work. After
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.240]   years and dozens and dozens, tens of thousands of pages of writing specific biblical commentaries,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.280]   he has been working through the process of publishing his capstone works, which are,
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.840]   in essence, a synthesis, an encapsulation of all of his 50 years of research in the area
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.760]   of Christian economics. He began in 2017 with the publication of Christian Economics,
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.840]   Student's Edition, and then he followed that up with Christian Economics, Teacher's Edition. I
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.000]   have read both of those books. This is the first two parts of a planned four-part series. He is
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.360]   working currently on Christian Economics, the Scholar's Edition, and that will be followed by
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.080]   the Christian Economics, Activist's Edition. So if you're interested in these particular areas,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.640]   I think this will be an interview that will serve you extremely well. You'll find this interview
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.480]   very, very interesting and challenging. You will notice if you look at the timestamp on your
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.800]   podcast player that this is a long show. It wasn't necessarily intended to be as long as it is,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.600]   but this interview was quite challenging and quite interesting. In essence, it's essentially
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.520]   two different parts. In the first part, I interviewed Dr. North and engaged with him
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.720]   on some of the topics that he has written on, but the interview became an ersatz debate, wherein
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.840]   he discovered some differences in my thinking. And as I engage with some of the things that he's
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.760]   written, we wound up having a somewhat complex and comprehensive theological debate. So I warn
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:55.440]   you now that this is not particularly specifically related to Christian Economics, but it is a very
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.160]   important part of life. And I am leaving it altogether because prior to the publication
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.520]   of this interview, I promised Dr. North I would release it as one unedited debate. Dr. North,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.480]   of course, holds many controversial opinions, and so he's used to being taken out of context,
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.520]   misquoted, et cetera. And one of the commitments I made to him was simply that I would release this
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.320]   as an unedited podcast. So you will hear the entirety of our conversation, and I think it will
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.360]   challenge you. So without further ado, Dr. Gary North, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.560]   Well, I'm glad to be here. I've looked forward to this conversation
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:41.200]   since we scheduled it because you have an extremely unique story which is of interest to me.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:48.240]   And perhaps peculiarly so, I haven't told you prior to our recording this, I haven't told you
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.600]   anything about me, but in the introduction for one of your recent books, which will be the
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.000]   teacher's, it's the preface to the teacher's manual of your book on Christian Economics,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.640]   which we'll be discussing in the context of today's interview, you write, "I have a target
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.880]   group in mind, Christians who read serious nonfiction books. Second, these people think
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.560]   that the Bible has answers for life's problems. Third, they are searching for explicitly Christian
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.080]   answers to economic issues. Fourth, they are concerned about the state of the economy.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.040]   And fifth, they are willing to take action if they discover these answers. They are activists."
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.080]   So, in the next line you write, "Is this you?" So, if you're curious about who you're talking
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.760]   to, Dr. North, that is me to a T. So, in the context of that, we'll be doing this particular
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.840]   interview. That's fine.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.520]   My audience, however, is a mixture. My audience is a mixture of Christians and non-Christians.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.720]   I have many qualified professional financial advisors who listen to this show and many
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.840]   interested non-professionals. So, we'll be speaking and starting at a more basic level
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.440]   and then going into some specific questions that I have as a longtime reader of your work.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.440]   I want to begin, though, with the background story to Christian economics and your series
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.240]   of books that you're publishing. How did you come to arrive and develop this project?
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   Well, that began in the spring of 1960. And I was an undergraduate freshman student at
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:36.240]   the University of California, Riverside. I was taking an economics class and I had been
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:43.040]   reading materials in the Freeman Magazine, which was published by the Foundation for
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.240]   Economic Education in Irvington-on-Hudson, New York. I'd been reading that material for
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:56.160]   about two years. And I also read a tabloid, which was published in those days, every two
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:04.080]   weeks, called Christian Economics. And that tabloid was sent to almost every Protestant
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.800]   pastor in the United States. It was funded by a very rich man named J. Howard Pugh, who
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:18.080]   was the head of Sun Oil. And he had a lot of money. And so he published this tabloid
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:25.680]   that was sent to the pastors and I read it on a regular basis. And I found that most of the
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:36.320]   writers in Christian economics were also writing for the Freeman. Well, the Freeman was non-sectarian,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.800]   certainly. And Christian economics was at least sectarian enough to be sent to something like
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:51.280]   170,000 pastors. So I got a little bit confused because the men who were writing for the Freeman
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:59.360]   and for Christian economics tended to be, if not atheists, then agnostics. And their worldview
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.600]   did not, in any sense of the word, seem to be based on Christianity or the Bible.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:17.040]   And that confused me at the time. So I decided that I would find out, if I could, what the
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:24.800]   relationship was between the Bible and the type of economic thought that was being published in
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:33.840]   the Freeman and in Christian economics. And that really began this project. It escalated over time,
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:46.240]   continued to escalate, and came to a head in 1976 when I began to devote 10 hours a week,
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:56.800]   50 weeks a year, to a verse-by-verse exegesis of the Bible in those areas that had something to say
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:07.280]   about economic theory or practice. And my cutoff date was my birthday in 2012 when I would turn
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:18.800]   70. And I finished the project approximately three weeks before I turned 70. So that may be
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:27.200]   an example of Parkinson's law, that is, work expands so as to fill the time allotted for its
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:36.240]   completion. But it was rather remarkable that the project, in fact, did take all of the last
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:44.960]   three weeks of that initial scheduling, which I'd done in 1976. I'm sorry, it was a little later. I
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:53.040]   think it was maybe 77, but it was a long period of time. >>SACHIT EGAN: And along the way,
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.680]   my understanding is you wrote, was it 31 volumes of commentary and perhaps six or seven
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.240]   supporting books that weren't specifically passage-by-passage commentary to arrive at
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.320]   the source material for your capstone projects? >>WARREN BUFFINGTON: Yes, it was 31 volumes. I've
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:25.040]   finally sat down and figured out the number of pages, and it was 8,500 pages typeset
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:35.360]   approximately. And to that, you would probably add another, I don't know, 1,500 pages, maybe
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:43.840]   something like that, of support volumes that came out of the writing project of the commentaries.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.240]   >>SACHIT EGAN: This is, of course, in addition to the four articles that you write and publish to
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.680]   your blog every day. By the way, Dr. North, I've gone to various conferences with bloggers and
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.440]   writers, and there have been times when I've listened to writers struggling to come up with
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.280]   material. I've told them, "By the way, you ought to go and check out a writer that I read who
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:13.920]   writes not one every day, not one a week, but four new independent articles each day, six days per
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:20.240]   week for his website." And not a single one of them has believed me. >>WARREN BUFFINGTON: Well,
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:26.800]   yeah, I got into this habit, I guess, about 12 years ago. I'd always done a lot of writing,
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:34.080]   but I just got trapped in this thing, and so I just keep going on it. Now, compared to somebody
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:44.800]   who's a really thorough and productive writer, Jacob Neusner, I'm, of course, and we're all a
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:58.720]   bunch of pikers, because Neusner wrote a book every three weeks for 40 years. Every three weeks,
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:05.200]   a new book came out, original book that he had produced. So the total for Neusner was
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:13.600]   approximately 1,000 volumes by the time he died. Now, that's productivity, but I do crank out a
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   good number of articles, and I have an advantage in that I have a lot of forums on my website,
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:26.560]   so when people ask a question on the forum that I can't answer in maybe a paragraph or so,
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:36.080]   then I will very often write an article that goes into detail to answer the particular question from
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:44.560]   the day before. And that's a very good source of inspiration for me to produce at least one or two
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:50.000]   articles a day, at least in those periods when people are asking a lot of questions.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.240]   So I want to begin now to home in on the religious context of this work that you have done
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.800]   with some background questions before we get to the specific findings that you've developed from
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:11.120]   these decades of study. First, for your knowledge, how I arrived at your work was, I think,
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:17.440]   perhaps how others do as well. But my parents were not particularly involved in politics,
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:28.800]   nor were they particularly involved in economics. But when I was younger, being raised in a
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.520]   Protestant Christian household, I kind of naturally gravitated, as many Christians do,
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.360]   towards republicanism as an ideology. And I was always interested in money and finance,
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:46.640]   and so I pursued republicanism and economics in the fairly mainstream perspective.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:54.240]   When I was 18 years old was when President George W. Bush chose to invade Iraq, and I was a
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:01.440]   drum-pounding supporter of that decision because of that background. But when I went to college,
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.320]   I studied under fairly mainstream professors, beginning with a degree in finance and accounting,
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.960]   and I had a pivotal moment when I was in my third year of college. I studied abroad
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:18.480]   in Central America, and my professors were Roman Catholic professors who were pretty hardcore
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:26.320]   liberation theologians. And our text for some of the discussion was the Book of Luke.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:33.120]   And in the context of the Book of Luke, these Roman Catholic, although not all, some were
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.560]   Protestant and some were Roman Catholic, but these professors took Jesus' statements and
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:45.520]   teachings in the Book of Luke and started to expand them under the ideology of liberation
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:51.920]   theology, very, very hardcore leftist socialist liberation theology. This really bothered me
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:58.800]   because it confronted my own free market approach. But I was in Central America, and instead of
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:06.720]   cheering for ideology or cheering for events such as NAFTA, I'm here walking on farms in Central
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.800]   America seeing and being told about the damage that a free trade agreement such as NAFTA had
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.680]   wrought in that particular country. It was also a time, and it was one of the first times in my
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.440]   life, when my college professors were actually able to beat me down and dismantle my arguments
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.880]   to the point where I was left without an answer. After that time, I came back to the United States,
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:35.680]   and it was in that time that I became serious in my relationship with God. I became born again at
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:41.680]   about the age of 20, and I really started to go back to Scripture to try to understand if what I
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:47.680]   had been taught by these liberation theologians was true. After studying that for a while, at some
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:53.440]   point, I glommed on and became aware of your work, perhaps as a reference to Jim Wallace,
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:01.760]   but I started to look and compare. I've often used you as the antithesis of my liberation
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:10.000]   theology professors, and I've often looked at you and them as almost opposite sides, but yet both
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.720]   using the same text. I want to begin with the use of the biblical text within that context.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.560]   Why do you think that it's appropriate to use the Bible to study a science like economics?
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:32.800]   For the same reason that I would say that you use the Bible for a study of political theory
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:41.040]   or ethics or basic philosophy, because you have to start somewhere. At some point,
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:49.200]   you have to say a certain set of presuppositions is true. No set of original presuppositions
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:59.440]   is ultimately self-supporting if there is not a higher power or greater source of knowledge
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.400]   available that informs the individual of the nature of cause and effect in history.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:12.800]   So you have modern Darwinism, which begins with purposelessness, and of course ultimately begins
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.920]   with the Big Bang, for which there is no explanation as to what there was before the
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:24.640]   Big Bang or exactly what it is that the Big Bang is. But out of purposelessness, which was basic
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:32.400]   to Darwinianism, came ultimately life. Out of life came mankind, and only with mankind do you have
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:41.280]   purpose. That's not a strong position to use to construct a philosophy, which ultimately begins
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:48.320]   with meaninglessness and then goes back to the heat death of the universe when it's all over,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:55.680]   which is ultimately meaningless. So I would say you have to start with something that is not
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:03.040]   inherently meaningless to begin to build any system of philosophy and especially any system
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:12.160]   of ethics. Where I differ primarily with free market economists, with a few exceptions,
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:20.320]   is that they assume that all economic theory is devoid of ethics or is in some way ethically
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:26.720]   neutral. That is the tremendous advantage liberation theologians have over conventional
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:34.480]   economists. And that is they appeal to ethics as the heart of their economic theory. And people
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.560]   want to hear about ethics. We teach our children that honesty is the best policy. You don't find
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:46.480]   a culture, or at least very few cultures, in which the children are taught that dishonesty is the
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:53.040]   best policy. And even in societies where that is taught, it's dishonesty against outsiders,
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:20:01.680]   but not dishonesty against those within the group. Ethics plays no real role in most approaches to
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:09.280]   economic theory. There were a few exceptions. Wilhelm Röpke was an exception, and I like
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:16.800]   Röpke's work. But generally, ethics plays no part in economic theory in the classroom,
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.480]   officially. Now, they sneak ethics through the back door, but officially,
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:30.400]   you have a supposedly systematic system of thought that is devoid of ethics. I was convinced very
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.160]   early that that could not be true because ethics infuses every area of social theory.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:43.760]   So I think what I would tell you is you can start with Luke, which tends to be of the four
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:50.640]   gospels, the one that could most easily be interpreted from the point of view of poverty
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:57.680]   versus wealth. But there's a systematic effort on the part of liberation theologians to ignore Mark
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:03.920]   and to ignore certainly the writings of Paul and to ignore Matthew. So what I did was start with
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:13.760]   Genesis 1-1 and then spent almost 40 years getting to the book of Revelation. I wanted to do the
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.440]   homework first, and that had not been done before, and so that's what I did.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:25.360]   >>SACHIT EGAN: The ethic that bothered me most—and by the way, Dr. North, could you give a concise
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.920]   summary of what liberation theology is? >>DR. NORTH: Well, liberation theology was a
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:39.840]   development primarily in Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly within the Roman Catholic
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:50.080]   Church. And that position was all over the spectrum, starting with a basic leftism that
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:57.440]   was in favor of the welfare state and stretching all the way to Marxist revolution, in which the
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.440]   particular theologian believed, as Marx believed, that you had to have some form of revolutionary
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:10.960]   violence in order to purge society. Most of them were somewhere in between those two positions.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:17.200]   There were plenty of socialists. They believed in central planning. They believed in the idea
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.560]   that the government can help the poor and has a moral obligation to help the poor, and the way
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:30.080]   that you do that is by stealing from the rich. The basic theology is thou shalt not steal except
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:41.680]   by majority vote. You could call it a radical form of social gospel economics, which began
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:49.360]   in the United States in the 1880s. This was a somewhat more radical form of the social gospel,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.280]   but the basic outlook is the same. That is, they believe in the healing power of coercion
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:02.560]   by the state, and that that is the way that you establish a viable economic order that is also
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:10.080]   a just economic order. Paul I will forever be indebted to those professors under whom I studied
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:19.440]   because they helped to disabuse me of the US-American imperialism that I had previously
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:25.520]   accepted without questioning just due to the virtue of being a part of mainstream Republican
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.960]   conservative circles in the United States. Ultimately, it was that question of coercion
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   that I came down to and I realized it's not a matter of violence versus no violence. It's a
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:43.520]   matter of who gets to control the levers of violence. Even while I was in Central America,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:52.880]   I realized that this is a fundamental, to use your word, ethic that to me seemed insuperable.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:24:01.040]   It seemed very clear that I could read the book of Luke and see Jesus' heart for the poor and his
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.200]   strong warnings against the rich, but to then take and say the next step that now we're going
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:18.000]   to take up arms by the poor in order to take from the rich to me didn't seem true to the actual text.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.800]   Speaking now of other religions, I've taken an interest to try to understand what other
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.520]   religious ideologies teach about economics. I've had a hard time finding representatives
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:40.800]   from other religions who have done similar work to you. Are you aware of anybody from
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:47.040]   non-Christian religions who has taken the central religious texts from their religious tradition
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:54.560]   and tried to bring it into a coherent model? Not that I have found, no. You would expect that
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.800]   some Jew would have done it. Actually, I expected that Israel Kirzner would have done it because
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:07.520]   he's an Orthodox Jew, and actually he's a rabbi and very well versed in Orthodox Judaism,
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:13.440]   and was one of the four men who received a PhD in economics under Ludwig von Mises.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:19.520]   So I've often said, well, of all the men who've ever come down the pike, Kirzner is the one who
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:28.240]   is both a follower of Moses and Mises, but he kept the two positions sealed off from each other,
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:35.920]   using a pagan terminology, hermetically sealed off from each other, and never used his
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:45.040]   understanding of either the Torah or the Talmud to comment on economic theory as presented by
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:53.920]   Mises or anybody else. He was the obvious man of my generation who might have done a similar project,
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:26:01.920]   but he chose not to do that. Most Jews who write in the field of economics are not Orthodox.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:12.640]   If anything, if they're practicing at all, they may go occasionally to a Reform Judaism
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:19.280]   temple, if they do it at all, but most of them are atheistic, and Mises is a good example,
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:27.520]   but Milton Friedman would be another example. And the texts of Judaism are simply ignored
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:34.560]   by these economists. However, that generally is also true of those who profess Christianity.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:43.840]   I don't know anybody in the Mormon church that has done this. Mark Skousen is an excellent
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:53.360]   economist and is a Mormon, and will occasionally cite some aspect of Mormon practice as
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:27:02.480]   an example of how to handle property or how to handle charity, but he has not produced
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:10.800]   any kind of exegetical work that would apply the Book of Mormon or doctrine and covenants
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:16.960]   to the actual economic theories that he would preach in the classroom,
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.040]   and I don't know of anybody at Brigham Young University who has done that either.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:30.640]   When you look at the world of Christian commentary, and I think it's probably any
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:39.360]   world, I recently have tried to find analogs to you and to your work from other religions. I've
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.320]   looked for, over the last couple years I've been studying the Quran, trying to understand it a
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:50.880]   little bit more because it's an area of significant weakness, and as Islam rises more and more to
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.680]   importance in public conversation, I've been trying to do my homework. I haven't been able
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.160]   to find an Islamic scholar who systematically works in the areas of Islamic finance yet,
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:07.520]   but in the world of Christian economic commentary, personal finance,
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:19.440]   economics, etc., it seems like you can find somebody professing an opinion on just about
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:26.800]   any extreme. So, for example, Jesus teaches that, it says in, was it Matthew 19, "Do not lay up for
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.600]   yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust corrupt and where thieves break in and steal,
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.800]   but instead lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not corrupt and
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.120]   where thieves do not break in and steal, for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:46.400]   I have read books on that from people who take that verse very seriously to the explicit point
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:55.040]   of obedience of not laying up any significant savings, stores of money, etc., at all. On the
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.280]   other hand, there are entire, that's a very minority movement, but the people that I've
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:06.000]   encountered who write and who practice this type of approach are very sincere in their belief.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.680]   On the other hand, there are wide swaths of Christianity all around the world which are
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:18.720]   major proponents of prosperity theology. Come and give to God, and after all it says in the Bible,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.720]   "Try me in this and give to God and God will give to you and God will pour out the riches of heaven
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:28.160]   on you and bless you with great wealth." So my almost presuppositional question to you is this,
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:34.800]   how do you figure out what's right, especially if you're not willing to dedicate 50 years to
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.120]   a verse-by-verse exegesis of all of the passages of Scripture?
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:50.320]   Well, the safest bet, as I've told people, is get a verse that is bothering you, go online to my
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.640]   site at garynorth.com, click the section on Christian economics, go to the section on
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:04.080]   economic commentary on the Bible, and then choose the particular book of the Bible that has
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:11.680]   presented the problem to you and read what I've commented about it. The great advantage of writing
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:18.720]   a commentary is that the commentary does serve as a good source of immediate information to people
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.600]   who get stuck on a particular verse. Now, nobody ever sits down and reads a commentary cover to
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:32.400]   cover, especially when it's 31 volumes long, and also it doesn't have any covers. But what we do
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:39.440]   find is that when we get stuck with a passage that we can't explain, there are commentaries
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:45.760]   out there that may throw light on the passage, and that's where we ought to begin. Now, the issue
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:59.520]   of laying treasure up is a legitimate issue. If the treasure is productive capital that is
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:05.680]   improving the lives of individuals within the context of a free market economy,
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:15.280]   then the treasure which is laid up is a product of activities that have satisfied
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:21.360]   specific customers who come back and say again and again, "I'm going to deal with you again. I'm
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.880]   going to buy from you again. I trust the way you're doing business. Your price is right.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:34.000]   The quality is good. You have a money-back guarantee," and so forth. Well, that was how
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:42.640]   Jeff Bezos got rich being the richest man in the world. He offered the best possible prices
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:51.440]   and the best delivery system in the history of retailing. He couldn't help but get rich.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:32:00.640]   The profit system tells an entrepreneur what customers want, and when the customer begins
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:06.560]   throwing money at him, the customer is saying, "Do it again. Do it again. Harder, harder."
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.960]   The customer says, "I want to do business. I want better deals. I want better prices.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.760]   I'll keep coming back to you if you provide the services that I'm after."
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:23.040]   On the other hand, when you suffer losses, the customer is saying, "No, you don't offer
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:29.440]   a good enough deal. I'm not going to be purchasing from you again. I don't like
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:35.200]   the arrangement that you're offering me. I've got better opportunities out there.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:42.480]   I'm not going to be back." Well, that person gets poor. At least over time, he will get poor.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:52.640]   That's the essence of the service motif. Jesus was clear that leadership within the church is to come
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:59.440]   from service. The service motif is basic to the Christian outlook. Well, the service motif is
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:08.480]   basic to the free market economy, too. Do you serve the wants, needs of paying customers?
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:16.800]   You have to be a faithful servant if you're going to be successful in a competitive market setting.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   So in terms of ethics, it's the same with respect to the general principles of success,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:31.680]   both in the church and in the free market. Now, motivations can be radically different.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:39.040]   And if somebody is out there saying, "My goal is to get rich, and I will provide these services
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:48.480]   in order to get rich," then he has been trapped by the service of what Jesus called mammon.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:55.120]   He's serving himself. More for me in history. And that's what Jesus warned against.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:02.080]   It's not that he said wealth is wrong, but he warned again and again against the motivation
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:09.200]   of the individual who seeks wealth in and of itself for its own sake. But that's not unique
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:17.680]   to Christianity. You find that in virtually every organized religion in the world. The ethical stand
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:24.480]   of virtually all religions is don't seek wealth and power for its own sake and for your own fame.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:32.400]   But if wealth and power come because of faithful service, then wealth and power are legitimate.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:43.120]   In your books, and here I'm referring to your Christian Economics Students Manual and the
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:50.080]   Teachers Manual, which are the two of the four that you've published, my understanding of your
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:56.480]   plan is that you started with a students manual, which is a simpler, concise presentation of your
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.520]   overall framework. And then you develop a teacher's manual, which has a little bit more
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:07.520]   background. You're working currently on a scholar's edition, which has more footnotes and more
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.240]   academic connection. And then you have planned an activist version as well.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.760]   In the introduction for your book, you make it clear that you're writing to Christians,
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:23.920]   but in your actual text, you don't distinguish between Christians and non-Christians. Do you
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:33.440]   believe that somebody has to be a Christian in order to, for lack of better words, use the
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:40.640]   economic methods and principles of the Bible? Or do these rules or practices
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.160]   function the same for Christians and non-Christians?
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:51.040]   >>Well, let's go to the Ten Commandments. Let's go to this second set of five.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:59.920]   The prohibition on murder applies across the board. The prohibition against adultery
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.800]   applies. The prohibition against theft applies. The prohibition against bearing false witness
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:14.400]   applies. Is there some good reason to believe that the prohibition on coveting another man's
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:23.840]   property or wife somehow does not apply? So from the perspective of the Bible,
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:33.440]   God said in Deuteronomy 4 that the world would look at the laws that he had given to Israel,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:41.520]   and the world would say, "This nation has a wonderful set of laws, that there's no other
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:47.600]   nation with a set of laws like the Hebrew nation," and therefore that this would be,
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:56.400]   in effect, a tool of evangelism, which I think it is. So the law as given, at least with respect
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:06.400]   to economics and basic ethics in the Bible and in the Old Testament, certainly was expected by Moses
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:14.320]   and by the Hebrews to be applicable across the border. Now, not every law was. The laws regarding
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:23.040]   sacrifice were understood to be specific laws to the Hebrew nation, and certainly they did not go
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:32.000]   out and try to get people to adopt all the policies and practices of the priesthood as
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:40.800]   a way to transform the societies around them. But they did expect people to abide by what I call the
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:48.240]   cross-boundary laws, best seen certainly in the second set of five commandments, but I think also
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:54.480]   they would apply in the first set of the five commandments as well. But certainly with respect
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:02.400]   to economic policy and practice, we're talking about the second set of five as being laws that
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:10.880]   apply across borders and across cultures. >> So then in that answer, we come to the
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:17.760]   question of perhaps of, I guess, differentiation. It may have been one thing when Jews were
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:26.880]   ethnically separated by bloodline from Gentiles, but in our modern era, we have a question of those
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.120]   who walk by faith and those who don't, or some distinction, I use the terms Christians and
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:40.640]   non-Christians, believers, unbelievers, some form of that. How do you personally teach people to
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:50.400]   interact where, when the Bible talks about faith and the personal experience that somebody has
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:57.840]   when approaching a question like the deity of Jesus, for example, versus understanding
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:05.360]   these principles that you elucidate in your work? Is there any distinction between them, or do we
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:11.600]   just say, "Well, these workings of economic principle and perhaps law just apply universally,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.080]   and it doesn't really matter whether you have faith or don't have faith"?
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:20.640]   >> Well, I've addressed that issue in a book that I wrote over 30 years ago called,
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:29.520]   a book on common grace, which you can download on my site, Dominion and Common Grace,
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:36.000]   and I talk about that. The problem you find is that at least through history,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.080]   people will commit to fundamental ethical principles, but if they do not believe they'll
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.120]   be successful or their heirs will be successful in the future, or if they believe that they're
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:55.680]   going to be defeated in history, or if they believe that the basic cause and effect system
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:04.400]   which undergirds economic action, the profit and loss system, if people don't believe that
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:13.760]   there is something outside of themselves and outside of the state to enforce a system of
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:23.600]   causation, then at some point they will seek another god to be the incarnate deity, which
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:30.720]   they will then worship one way or another as an alternative to worshiping the God of the Bible.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:38.400]   And in modern times, the great deity has been the state, and that certainly was the case in
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:45.200]   the time of the Roman Empire. It was far less so during the medieval period, which was inherently
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:51.760]   Christian. But with the rise of the Enlightenment and especially the rise of the French Revolution,
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:41:01.040]   there has been a deification of the state, and it is only really in the last 25 years or 30 years
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:08.640]   that we have finally seen the beginning of the breakdown of that religion, manifested obviously
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:18.000]   in the reforms of Deng Xiaoping in 1978 to free up agriculture in China, and then of course the
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.760]   classic example on December 25th, 1991, when Gorbachev went on national television and basically
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:33.680]   buried the Soviet Union. That was the end. Now, after that, it has become a lot more difficult
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:42.720]   for people to be taken seriously with some variety of the doctrine of salvation by state power.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:50.320]   And so we're living in an era in which the alternative to the state as a way of establishing
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:59.280]   justice and defending ethics has been a kind of frantic scramble to see what the new deity is
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:07.120]   going to be. And there really is no agreement on that today as there would have been when you were
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:13.760]   studying under liberation theologians. But remember, even when you got down to Latin America,
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:21.520]   the Soviet Union was gone. And it was easy to say you didn't like the empire of the United States
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:30.480]   in 2003. That's pretty easy. What you did not find was liberation theologians in 1978 saying
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:38.240]   the Soviet Union is as evil an empire as the United States and a pox on both their houses.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:44.640]   It was easy to do after 1991. >> There does seem to be,
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:53.040]   bringing it current, I have observed the trend that you're discussing in our modern society.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:43:01.040]   It seems to me with 32 years of walking this earth worth of experience and perhaps 15 years of adult
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:08.880]   focus, it seems as though the stakes in our current world have about government action and
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:14.400]   the involvement of the state have gotten higher. I read and have referenced on this show RJ Rush
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:20.240]   Duny's book, The Messianic Character of American Education, where I think he lays out the case
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:27.840]   quite strongly that the educational system, the government school system has taken on the modern
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:34.240]   function of a priesthood and the delivering of sacraments and that salvation for a person,
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:42.400]   the getting rid of sin and the enhancement of virtue, one variation of the word salvation,
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:50.800]   it tries to accomplish it through education. That if we could just educate somebody well enough,
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:55.360]   if we could just educate all those poor rotten street urchins, then we could drive all their
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.920]   vices out of them and we could save them so that they would be good and upright people.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:06.240]   It seems to me that my analysis of 2018 politics in the United States of America,
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:12.400]   that we have just an intensification of this trend over the last 50 years, where we've got to be the
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:18.960]   only tool left for secular post-Christian man is the government, that the state has to do it. The
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:24.480]   state has to be the one to come in and to cleanse the people from their sin, to lift up the people
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:30.960]   who are downtrodden and to perfect the society. I can see that. That's the trend that you're
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.680]   referring to in your commentary, right? >> Correct.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:45.120]   >> Going back to the discussion of application, I'd like to go to one common scriptural passage
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:52.240]   and start in the Book of Malachi. I guess what I'm asking is here a hermeneutical question,
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:59.600]   a question of interpretation. There is a scripture that I find extremely challenging to know how to
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:07.040]   deal with rightly, because it seems to me to be a use of much abuse, a scripture that is,
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:15.360]   from my perspective, abused. I am very concerned in some of my travels and exposure to
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:25.440]   places outside of the Western world, especially parts of Africa and elsewhere, how the Bible
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:34.400]   seems to be used as a battering ram to make one person, the preacher, rich at the expense of the
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:40.480]   congregants. I think one of the most stark passages of this would come from Malachi 3.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:48.160]   I want to read the verse in context. My question relates to how you approach a passage like this
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:54.320]   and understand who it is speaking to. Picking up in the middle of Malachi 3, verse 6,
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:01.840]   the prophet Malachi writes this, speaking in a prophetic voice for God himself. "For I,
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:08.960]   the Lord, do not change. Therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed. From the days of your
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:14.240]   fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   return to you, says the Lord of hosts. But you say, 'How shall we return? Will man rob God?'
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:26.480]   Yet you are robbing me. But you say, 'How have we robbed you? In your tithes and contributions.'
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:32.960]   You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. Bring the full tithe
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:37.600]   into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and thereby put me to the test,
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:43.440]   says the Lord of hosts. If I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:49.280]   a blessing until there is no more need, I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.720]   destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the Lord
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:59.920]   of hosts. Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:11.040]   of hosts." So in this context, this particular passage, I see proclaimed by, I'm going to put
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:18.640]   my own ethical judgment, evil men who use this as a way of accreting to themselves great riches
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:24.160]   from the pockets of their congregants, which riches are used to furnish their own houses,
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:30.800]   to buy their own private planes on the backs of the poor. And yet, it's very hard for me to deny
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:36.320]   the straightforward message of this particular scripture. The preacher stands up and says,
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.960]   "Give to God, bring the full tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in my
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:46.800]   house, so give to the church." And it really bothers me, but yet, to know how to apply these,
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:53.360]   but it's basically a question of interpretation. So how do you approach a passage like this,
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.840]   which is addressed to the children of Jacob, and yet apply it in a modern context?
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:05.600]   Well, it's the same principle as I discussed before. It's a principle of servanship.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:18.640]   That is, if you look at 1 Timothy 3, especially, chapter 3, you have outlined what criteria for
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:25.440]   being a pastor, and the criteria are the same for being a deacon who will control the money,
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:32.560]   and that is, they're supposed to have good reputations with respect to the government
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:39.440]   of their families, and to the fact that they are not after, in the words of the King James,
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:48.800]   "filthy lucre," or dirty money. The criteria are clear in terms of the New Testament,
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.600]   and I don't see that they would be any different in terms of the Old Testament as well,
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:49:01.200]   that the individual who is a good servant is not supposed to be impoverished. There is no
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   teaching like that. But at the same time, there has to be a servant mentality in which
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.440]   the leaders are serving the people, whether they're political leaders,
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.200]   economic leaders, or ecclesiastical leaders.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:30.720]   So another, so for clarification, what I'm hearing you say is you would have no fear of publicly
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:38.000]   preaching the message that Malachi here is proclaiming to any people, but you would balance
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:46.880]   that with the clear scriptural mandates for other expressions of virtue and integrity,
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:53.600]   and say that both of these things are true. So the point of, if one were to confront a pastor
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:59.840]   like I described, or preacher like I described, you would not confront him on the basis of his
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:05.840]   proclamation of this passage, but rather you would confront him on his seeming desire for
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.360]   filthy lucre. Is that an accurate summary of what you're saying?
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.840]   >>Kaufmann Yeah. His motivation is not service,
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:21.280]   which is reflected in the fact that he has accumulated wealth that has been provided by
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:28.800]   the poor, but then that applies to every king in history. That's not limited ecclesiastically.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.720]   >>Ashkahn So, go ahead.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:39.920]   >>Kaufmann I guess what I'm getting at is this. Would we say that a man who is
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:47.040]   accumulating wealth on the basis of service in the free market is doing the wrong thing? Well,
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:52.560]   the liberation theologians say yes he is, but the liberation theologians don't understand
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:58.480]   that he cannot be accumulating wealth in terms of a competitive market unless he's providing some
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:04.640]   kind of valuable service where people in the community voluntarily are coming back and saying,
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:09.600]   "Well, I think this is a good service." Similarly, people get reelected. Well,
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.880]   if they're reelected the way Ron Paul was reelected on the basis of shrinking the government
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:20.000]   and resisting the expansion of the state, I would say, "Well, that's certainly a positive thing."
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.080]   On the other hand, if they're reelected the way Lyndon Johnson was reelected as a means of
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:33.600]   extracting wealth from richer people, officially at least, and giving the money to the poor,
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:38.560]   then I would say that's a misuse of the office. But there's nothing illegitimate about the office.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:44.800]   There's nothing illegitimate about the idea that people who run for office should be elected by
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:52.480]   the general public. The problem is that the public, unfortunately, wants to get its hands in
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:57.120]   the next door neighbor's wallet, but doesn't want to do it directly. So,
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:03.440]   these people vote for politicians who are going to give them what they want. And Johnson was an
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:07.920]   exceedingly wealthy man, and he didn't get it in the free market. He got it through
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:19.040]   political manipulation. His wife had the only licensed television station in Austin, Texas,
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:26.240]   for years. Well, that was no accident. So, we have a situation in which the principle of
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:36.960]   servanship can be used in order to accumulate wealth or power or influence or whatever else
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:45.600]   men pursue. And the old threesome has always been the same, money, sex, and power. And then for the
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:54.080]   people at the very top of the heap, we add fame. And people will do almost anything at the very top
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:53:02.320]   to gain some degree of fame. And that's been the king's weakness for as long as we have kingship.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:13.360]   So, I guess what I'm saying is I don't see that there's any difference in principle between
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:20.800]   the person who accumulates great wealth in three different spheres. The question is,
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:28.240]   how did he do it? Does he lie? Does he cheat? Does he steal? Does he appeal to people's
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:33.200]   base instincts? That's certainly a way you can get rich, at least for a time.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:41.120]   Or does he do something productive and yet cares only for himself, like the rich man who
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:47.680]   accumulated wealth in order to build barns so that he could store even more grain? Well,
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:54.960]   there's nothing wrong with large barns storing grain, but that man only thought of the immediate
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.880]   goal of building those barns. And Christ said, "You fool, you're going to give an account for
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:08.880]   yourself this evening." That's the great error of power seekers. That's the great error of
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:16.080]   wealth seekers. And that's the great error of people who use ecclesiastical influence to build
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:23.600]   up their own personal fiefdoms or personal kingdoms by means of a misuse of service.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:33.040]   Coming back to Malachi chapter three, again, for a follow-up question. I use this passage because
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:42.560]   it's one of the only passages I'm aware of where there is such a strong statement by God where he
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:48.560]   says, "Put me to the test." And the passage says, "Bring the full tithe into the storehouse that
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:54.080]   there may be food in my house, and thereby put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts,
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:58.640]   if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:07.760]   no more need." Does this... Go ahead. Well, that's just an extension of Deuteronomy 28,
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:16.880]   verses one through 14. The prophets always come to the people in the name of Moses, and thereby
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:22.640]   in the name of God who revealed himself to Moses. The message of the prophets over and over and over
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:30.480]   was simply, "You have violated my law. You knew the law. It's been in front of you from the
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:38.000]   beginning of the nation after the Exodus. You're violating the principles. So you're going to get
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:45.360]   the negative sanctions that were listed in Deuteronomy 15 through 68, and you're not going
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:53.440]   to get the positive sanctions of Deuteronomy 28, one through 14." But there's no deviation. And if
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:56:00.320]   you want to look at another passage, parallel passage, it's Leviticus 26. The prophets are not
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:08.640]   bringing a new message to Israel. The prophets always were bringing the original message that
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:19.680]   goes back to Moses immediately after the Exodus. So is this message in Malachi 3, Deuteronomy 28,
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:28.800]   and Leviticus 26, is this message to individuals, or is this message to a collective group?
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:36.720]   Well, because of the doctrine of the Trinity, we have to say that there is both one and many.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:45.120]   God is both one and many. Therefore, the law applies both to the one and to the many.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:53.120]   And to say that it applies only to one and not to the other is ultimately going to lead to some form
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:57:01.600]   of either Unitarianism or polytheism, and neither of those positions can be defended in terms of the
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   New Testament. So that's a fundamental theological point that has to do with the original doctrine
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:18.080]   of God as taught in the New Testament, that there has to be both one and many. So the laws apply
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:27.760]   both to individuals and to collectives, and God holds both responsible. Societies are held
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:35.360]   responsible for deviant behavior. And you will find people who say, "Well, that can't be true."
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:42.240]   But then you look at Germany in the 1930s, and then you look at what happened to them in the 1940s,
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:47.920]   and most people in the West would say, "Yes, that's legitimate. That's what should have
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:54.400]   happened." You can't do what Germany did in the 1930s and not wind up with something like
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:02.400]   what happened to them in the mid-1940s. I think that's legitimate. People say there has to be
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:09.920]   some kind of relationship between ethical cause and economic collective effect,
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:17.120]   and that if you were caught in Germany under the rulership of a man like Hitler,
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:23.680]   then if you remained in Germany, you were very likely going to be on the receiving end of
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:30.000]   negative sanctions if he continued to follow the policies that he ultimately continued to follow.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:39.920]   And I think the same thing is true of Stalin. The death rate that was suffered by the famines
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:49.920]   that Stalin engineered, the death rates were in the millions in the Soviet Union
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:57.840]   because of the horrendous policies of socialized agriculture and confiscation
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:04.160]   that Stalin mandated and that his henchmen like Khrushchev enforced.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:14.800]   >>SAM: Beginning then with an individual, if I'm working giving financial counseling
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:22.080]   to an individual who is broke, poor, broke, I don't know that I've ever interacted with
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:27.200]   an individual except in another... I've never interacted with an individual in the United
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:33.840]   States that I think is ever truly broke or poor, at least using biblical standards that only has
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:40.720]   one cloak to cover them at night. But if I'm interacting with an individual, should I think
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:51.280]   this is that their poverty is a result of their personal nonconformity to or disobedience to
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:58.960]   God's laws, or should I think that they may be entirely innocent and their personal poverty
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.120]   is simply a reflection of other people or other factors?
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:12.480]   >>WILLIAMS Well, poverty in the modern world is virtually always the result of corrupt political
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:20.240]   systems. We've had the greatest amount of economic growth in history beginning around 1800,
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:27.920]   growth on a scale that could not have been conceived in 1800 and could barely be conceived
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:37.280]   in 1900, but that growth was not transferred to North Korea or Cuba, and it's certainly being
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:48.240]   withdrawn in Venezuela. And the policies of those countries have been the reason why individuals in
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:56.720]   those countries are really under the burden of extreme poverty. So if you're looking at an
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:03.200]   individual who is sober and has stayed with his wife and seems to be a pretty good leader within
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:12.320]   the community, participates in some kind of church activity, clothes his children, feeds his children,
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:19.040]   provides some kind of education for his children, and he is still poor, then my opinion is you start
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:26.080]   looking at the society around him, the presuppositions about the nature of economic
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:34.160]   cause and effect, and you look to see where envy is loose in the land, the desire to pull down the
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:40.160]   rich person just for the sake of pulling him down. Wherever you have political envy, you're going to
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:47.440]   have poverty. There's no way around that. That's the nature of economic cause and effect, and which
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:55.120]   is ultimately ethical cause and effect. So you have to look at the difference between what in
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.840]   the late 19th century and even earlier was called the distinction between the deserving poor and the
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:08.400]   undeserving poor. And the deserving poor were people who really were entitled from an ethical
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:16.000]   standpoint to be helped by others who had the means to do that, but the undeserving poor,
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.360]   the people whose lifestyle had brought them into poverty and who now want a handout, that was
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:30.800]   assumed to be wasted money unless you could bring that person to some kind of ethical transformation.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:37.920]   Basically, it's the same as handing out money to a man on the street who is in poverty and is a
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:44.880]   known alcoholic. You know what he's going to do with the money, and it's not to help educate his
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:54.800]   children. - Yeah, that's my personal beef with the government's, to use the US American phrase,
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.560]   war on poverty, by which they mean taking money from some people and giving it to others.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:07.200]   There's no mechanism for accountability. If I see the man in my neighborhood who is living on the
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:13.280]   street, I can go over and I can interact with him and I can find out what his circumstances are,
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:20.160]   and I can give him money to help him and seek to work with him. But then if I see him using that
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:25.200]   money in the wrong way and not making progress, not taking steps of action, then I can freely
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.720]   and easily cut him off and he can experience the just rewards for his poor decisions,
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:37.760]   rather than continuing to pour money in due to some policy of non-discrimination against poor
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:44.880]   people. It's really, I personally, from having done quite a bit of financial counseling, I really
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:52.800]   struggle with the destructiveness of government programs that transfer money from one person to
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   another, because there is no ability for a bureaucrat to actually make judgments on the
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.160]   worthiness of a recipient. Only an individual can do that who's actually involved in taking the time,
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:12.240]   and only an individual who actually has the personal motivation to see their hard-earned
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.920]   dollars be used for good and to help somebody's life, only that individual will have the motivation
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.680]   to actually do the hard work of getting personally involved, at least as I see it.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:28.800]   >>WARREN: Well, from a legal standpoint, the person working with a government welfare agency
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:36.800]   is not allowed to ask most questions associated with ethics. The rare exception would be the case
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:43.920]   of aid to a woman who has a man, not her husband, living with her. Of course, the problem with that
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:53.200]   is the guy doesn't live with her full time. He comes and goes. He is not a stable force in her
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:59.840]   life or the life of her children. So that law has backfired against the family structure
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:08.720]   in ghetto communities. There are no ethical criteria. There may be a technical criterion,
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:15.920]   that is, have you looked for a job over the last 30 days or however long it's been? Do you have
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.480]   evidence that you have looked for a job? But these people know how to work the system,
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:26.720]   and they never seem to get employed on a full-time basis. It's only when they decide
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:32.320]   they want to clean up their acts that there is any real hope for them. And that has to come
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:41.360]   from the individual. That's not going to work because some federal bureaucrat comes in and
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:47.680]   tells the person to shape up his life. Only if the bureaucrat is in a position to cut off the
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:56.160]   money is he going to get even token cooperation. >> So I want to finish this theme of questioning
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:05.440]   that I've been pursuing with an example from The Collective. In your judgment, in 2012,
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.880]   my wife and I visited Haiti as part of our honeymoon. And it was my first time visiting
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.720]   Haiti. I've known a lot of Haitians since I live in South Florida. But it was my first time visiting
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.680]   Haiti. I had previously spent time in Nicaragua, which is the second poorest country in the
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.880]   Western Hemisphere, but Haiti, of course, the poorest country. And it was one of the most
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:34.720]   sobering and humbling experiences to actually be there in Haiti. This was after the major earthquake.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:45.840]   And so I was in downtown Port-au-Prince. And I was looking at the rubble of the governor's
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:54.160]   palace and mansion, et cetera. And it was the most emotionally draining place I have ever visited in
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:07:02.480]   my life. Because, of course, the majority of the country is dominated by squalor and tent cities
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:12.880]   and just ineffably awful human living conditions. And yet, those are the things that are easily seen
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:19.680]   in a video cast or pictures which tug at your heartstrings. But actually being there as a
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:29.520]   traveler, it was a draining place to be because practically, probably 80%, of course, but most
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:35.200]   of the people, with a few exceptions, most of the people with whom I interacted on a business level
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.680]   sought to cheat me and sought to take advantage of me and sought to...
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:45.760]   were not very good hosts. I have since warned many people, "Do everything you can not to visit
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.960]   Haiti." And of course, there were exceptions. There were several honest people along the way
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:56.800]   that helped us and served us, and we were very grateful for it. But I couldn't leave fast enough
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:04.960]   because of the difficulty of traveling there and my need to constantly be on guard. I was also,
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:12.720]   while there, deeply just impressed with a sense of darkness, just this deep spiritual darkness
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:18.560]   that was an impression, a feeling that was almost inescapable. Now, in modern society,
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:24.960]   I, of course, am guilty of racism for acknowledging these things of a primarily black country.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:32.560]   But the reality was I have never known how to process that actual experience, the experience
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:39.920]   of being desperately filled with compassion and desperately wanting to help and to serve,
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:47.520]   but simultaneously being utterly offended and constantly on the defense because it seemed as
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:52.720]   though every single person was out to cheat me. And of course, that may be a little bit
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:59.360]   hyperbolic, but that was what it felt like. And of course, it's easy for me to feel guilty in the
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.040]   modern era to say, "No, they're poor people and they cheat because they're poor." And I've always
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:08.160]   wrestled with this question, "Did everybody try to cheat me because they were poor and desperate,
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.560]   or are they poor and desperate because they tried to cheat me? Is this a reflection of
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:18.400]   the broader culture?" So obviously, a difficult and pointed question. But when we consider
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.640]   a difficult case like Haiti, just a few hundred miles from me,
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:32.480]   how do we approach it from a biblical perspective, recognizing the darkness of the culture,
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.640]   but also recognizing our duty of compassion and care? How do we approach it? And who do we hold
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.600]   responsible for their decisions? >> Well, the first thing you do is you
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.000]   have half your vacation in the Dominican Republic. >> Which is exactly what we did.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.720]   >> Yeah. >> We were only there for a small period of time.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.760]   >> That's right. You see the difference. You can see the difference from the air.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.800]   >> It's night and day. At the border, it's night and day.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:04.240]   >> That's right. You don't have any better example of that in the Western Hemisphere.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:13.440]   And I suspect you don't have any better example of that difference on Earth. You have two radically
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.480]   different societies. It has nothing to do with the fertility of the soil. It has nothing to do
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:27.200]   with differences in the weather. It has nothing to do with telecommunications, potentially.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:35.120]   Same systems, technical systems are available to both societies, but they are radically different
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:41.680]   cultures. Now, the Dominican Republic is no paradise of wealth by any standard. But the
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:51.360]   contrast between the Dominican Republic and Haiti is such that if you wanted to make a video
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:11:02.800]   of the absolute bleakness of voodoo culture versus some degree of hope in Catholic culture,
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:08.880]   that's where you would make the video, on the two halves of that island.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:17.520]   And this is not something new. This goes back certainly to the original revolution
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:26.480]   in Haiti that took place over 200 years ago. That problem has been endemic to Haiti
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:35.760]   for as long as it has existed as a separate society. So again, you have to look at the
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.440]   nature of the doctrine of cause and effect in the two countries, the two social orders.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:47.280]   And they are very, very different social orders leading to different political orders,
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:54.320]   leading to radically different personal ethics, and then ultimately leading to radically different
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:00.560]   per capita income. Marc Thiessen So let me contrast that now with the United
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:06.000]   States of America, the per capita wealthiest country in the world, as my understanding at
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:18.320]   least. In the modern US-American context, it would be relatively easy to draw the idea that, well,
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:24.960]   we as US-Americans are just so great people. We're fantastic, and we're rich because we're good.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:30.720]   And that is certainly a perspective that I understand because I absorb some of that,
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.840]   especially from republicanism and conservatism in the past when I was younger and perhaps a
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:43.680]   little bit less self-aware. But in our modern era, I desperately question that because by my analysis,
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:50.880]   the United States of America deserves very little except fire and brimstone from heaven,
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:13:01.360]   given our extremely deeply sinful culture. So do we take credit and say, "Well, we're rich because
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:09.280]   we're righteous in some way"? Do we look at, for example, I read a book on geography,
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.640]   the geography of the United States of America, people who try to explain the wealth of the
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.600]   United States based upon that, or do we look to ethics? And how do we know if we're looking at
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:28.080]   ethics too much or too little? You go to the borders, and you look across the northern border
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.600]   to Canada, and you can't tell the difference. You look at the southern border with Mexico,
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:41.760]   and you can't avoid the difference. It's not geography. The borders reflect two different
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:48.160]   cultures, two different approaches to the building of wealth and the inheritance of wealth
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:55.840]   over time. These are very, very different cultures on the southern border, and they are
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:03.680]   almost indistinguishable cultures at the northern border. People don't spend a lot of time
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:10.080]   discussing this and studying the difference, but certainly in North America, I think that's
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:17.920]   where I would begin any kind of analysis. What keeps Mexico poor? And at the same time,
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:25.280]   why in the last 40 years or 35 years has Mexico progressively gotten richer,
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:33.200]   whereas now it's not a third world country at all? Well, I think the answer that the free market
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:41.600]   economists have always said would be look at per capita capital investment. Look at the nature of
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:50.320]   the right of contract, for example. Mexico is much less tyrannical today than it was half a century
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:57.920]   ago, and certainly is much less tyrannical than it was prior to World War II. But we don't know
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:03.440]   much about Mexico. We don't study the matter. But here was a country that went through something
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:11.360]   like a socialist revolution before World War I. It was not the Soviet revolution that was the model,
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:19.040]   it was the Mexican revolution. And you had this enormous exodus out of Mexico. I don't know how,
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:22.720]   what the numbers are. I don't know if we can know, but it's certainly over a million people
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.320]   who got out and came here because they could cross the border in those days. It was legal.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:34.720]   And they came here with nothing in their pockets and very little on their backs to escape the
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:40.080]   revolution in Mexico, which I think was a great idea. That's what I would have done too.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:46.800]   So you have different social orders, different ethical standards, different legal orders.
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:59.280]   And when you find two societies across a border that reflect the different levels of productivity
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:05.200]   of the two social orders, then it's a good idea to start studying the differences between those
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:10.320]   social orders and legal orders as the source of the difference of wealth.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:21.920]   Then how would you respond to the perhaps secular academic who would observe these facts? Mexico is
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:28.720]   deeply Catholic and has a strong history of Catholicism, including of course Roman Catholicism
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:35.680]   under perhaps just a broad tint of mere Christianity. But yet Canada is, I don't know if
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:41.440]   the adjective deeply is appropriate, but very secular and increasingly secular, much more
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:48.400]   secular than the United States. So the Catholic Mexico seems to be much poorer and perhaps
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:55.360]   through their society reflects these attributes that you're discussing. And yet the secular Canada
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:00.880]   seems to be much richer and to have a much higher standard of living, even though there is very
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:07.120]   little influence of the Christian religion. Does that defeat your case?
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.560]   No, you have different legal systems. And you have the fact that in Mexico, you have,
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:21.600]   or very close to it, a one party system. Only in recent years have you developed anything like a
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:27.840]   two party system and it's not very strong. You also have a legal order that is based on
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:35.440]   Spanish law, whereas in the United States and in Canada, you have a legal order that is based
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:45.200]   ultimately, bottom line, on a legal order in which the judiciary has an independent status.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:54.800]   And so the legal orders of the two countries on the northern side of the Mexican border are very,
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:00.640]   very similar. The political orders, while different in terms of whether or not you have
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:07.520]   a parliamentary system or a congressional system, the legal orders are pretty much the same.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:13.200]   There are strong two party systems. And to some extent, of course, in Canada,
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:18.720]   you may get a three party system operating because the country is a parliamentary system.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:28.640]   But in both systems, across the northern borders, you have a legal order in which justice is assumed
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:37.440]   to be different from politics. And the justice is a product of a long tradition of the Western
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:45.600]   legal tradition, which is based on an independent judiciary that has the power to thwart the
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:52.320]   expansion of the politicians in the central government. And Britain has the same system.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:19:02.000]   And you have it, obviously, in the ANZAC countries, New Zealand and Australia. You have
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:10.480]   English law, which is not centralized law, which is not politically based,
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.960]   but has an independent judiciary. Well, I think that's a basic biblical principle,
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.400]   is that you have to have the power of the courts deciding who is guilty and who is not.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:32.000]   And until quite recently, you had the concept of the independent jury. And jury nullification
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:40.240]   was possible, certainly after the mid 17th century, to thwart the expansion of centralized power,
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:47.600]   first in Great Britain and then in North America. That's a powerful tradition to keep liberty.
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:53.840]   And the English speaking world has had that tremendous advantage that the rest of the world
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:20:02.880]   has not had. And it was in North America and in the British Isles that long term economic growth
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:10.960]   of 2% per annum first appeared. That had never happened in the world before. And over time,
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:16.480]   it has led to this tremendous disparity between the wealth of North America and the wealth of
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:23.600]   Great Britain compared to the second world and the third world. And neither of those worlds
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:31.600]   has an independent judiciary, minimal central government, and by comparison,
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:40.720]   relatively weak government compared to the Anglo American tradition and the Western legal tradition.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:47.200]   Is it fair then to characterize some of what you're saying in this way?
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:56.960]   Although Mexico may have many people who, when asked on a survey, would say, "Yes, I'm Catholic,
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:04.960]   I'm Christian," and Canada would have very few, or fewer, many, many fewer, many more in Canada
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:12.800]   would say, "I'm atheist, agnostic, secular, non-believer, I'm a nun," are you characterizing
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:19.520]   that even though they would self-report their religious identity differently, that the Mexican
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:31.440]   culture society systems reflect a much weaker representation of the biblical ideal than the
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:38.560]   Canadian do, even though the Canadian culture society, et cetera, reflects the biblical ideal?
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.560]   Is that an accurate characterization of what you're saying, that the self-reporting
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.120]   is less important than the actual facts on the ground?
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:50.720]   >>WARREN: If you want to know the essence of what's going on in Mexico,
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:57.840]   look at the color of the people and look at the color of the rulers. That's as racist a society
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.320]   as you'll find anywhere in the Western hemisphere, with the possible exception of Haiti.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:09.680]   They are a separate culture, separate worldview, separate educational system,
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.880]   and Mexico has always had that. Latin America always had it to some extent,
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.400]   but not to the degree that Mexico does. Everybody's white in the leadership in Mexico.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:26.800]   Well, how is that possible in a democratic social order? The only time you have anybody who has dark
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:34.880]   skin is after a military coup, and you haven't had that in the post-World War II era. Something is
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:41.040]   fundamentally different about the Mexican political system, and you can see it if you look at the,
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:46.960]   literally, at the color of the leaders versus the color of the population.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:57.840]   Now, with respect to how serious are Mexicans regarding their commitment to the Catholic
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:05.920]   Church, I'm not an expert in Mexican religion to tell you, but historically, the commitment
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:13.120]   of the leadership has been to a white European culture, not to a mixed or mestizo culture
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:21.280]   that is operating at the lower end, the vast majority, but still the lower end of the social
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:26.400]   order that exists in Mexico. There's something very peculiar going on there.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.960]   Now, it's beginning to change. The free market is changing that. People can get
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:38.080]   good educations in Mexico today. There is greater freedom than there has been in the past.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:45.360]   People who are at the lower end of the social order can use education and thrift and
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:52.720]   entrepreneurship to climb up the ladder of social influence and economic influence,
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:24:00.480]   and economic growth has been prominent in Mexico, certainly over the last 25 or 30 years.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:07.360]   It's not a third world country. It's a second world country, and it's moving up pretty steadily.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:14.240]   So the free market is having its effect. Technology is having its effect. Communications
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:21.040]   are having a tremendous liberating effect in Mexico, and the country is different today from
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:28.800]   what it was 50 years ago. But Mexico is behind, and I don't think it's primarily because of
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:37.200]   geography. I think it's because the social and political order has represented a more hierarchical
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:44.320]   system of ecclesiastical order than we have in a Protestant culture, and by the way,
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:51.120]   that we have in Catholic culture in the United States, which looks amazingly like
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.240]   Protestant culture, and especially that's true since the late 1960s.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:08.080]   So then what defense... Let's assume... And what I'm driving at here, I guess, is the impact of...
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:18.800]   You've written for 50 years, perhaps 9,000 pages on what the Bible has to say about economics.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:28.160]   So of course, you are arguing vigorously and consistently for accepting the biblical
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.280]   structure, the biblical version of events, the biblical structure for economic systems,
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:43.280]   both personal and societal. But I have, of course, many non-Christian friends, and I often
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:51.600]   look at the world through their eyes, and it's rather disheartening when you describe a deeply...
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:26:01.440]   Religion takes a bad rap, specifically Christian religion takes a bad rap when you describe a
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:07.840]   deeply Catholic culture as intensely racist, which aligns with some of my experience in
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:14.160]   Central America as well. I used to think I was rather naive when growing up. I used to think
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:20.080]   that racism was connected to the color of somebody's skin until I traveled in Central America,
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:26.000]   and without indicting the guilty, I would be in one Central American country and listen to the
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.760]   things that people warned me about the neighboring Central American country, both of whose occupants
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:39.040]   had brown skin and spoke very similar Spanish, and yet there was an intense opposition to them.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:47.600]   Or similarly, I have worked with Black Haitians here in South Florida, and the level of racial
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:55.920]   animus between Black Haitians and African Americans, Black traditional African Americans,
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:05.600]   is not insubstantial. But back to the point, when I hear a Catholic culture, a predominantly
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:13.280]   Catholic Christian culture that is very racist, and yet a very secular culture that is less racist,
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.640]   and then it makes me say, "Well, what's the point of religion?" And, for example, our own
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:27.280]   Protestant heritage in the United States of America, we have so many sins in our past
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:37.120]   that it's not hard for me to understand the people who are vigorously anti-Christian.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:43.600]   They have plenty of grist for their mill. So what do we do with that? Do we say, "Well,
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:49.360]   you don't have to actually believe these doctrines, just do these things"? Or how do we hold that when
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:54.720]   talking about these things in public? >> Well, give me an example.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:08.480]   >> For my friend who says, "Well, I agree that justice is important, but I don't agree that the
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:14.880]   source of justice, of the ethic of justice," or let's go back to the ethic of coercion, right?
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:21.760]   There are many secular libertarians who practice the non-aggression principle, who defend and
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:26.160]   practice the non-aggression principle, and yet they don't draw... >> No, as a matter of fact,
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:32.800]   there aren't. >> Okay, how do you mean? >> Well, first of all, there are almost no libertarians.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:37.520]   You're talking about... >> That is true. >> ...a couple of thousand people holding an oddball
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:44.320]   position. So who are these guys? Yeah, there are people who say they hold that position,
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:49.760]   but they are on the fringe of the culture. They've only been two representatives of the
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:56.800]   position of the 20th century and 21st, as Ron Paul and Howard Buffett, two congressmen
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:06.320]   at the time regarded as peculiar. So if you're talking... See, you run in strange circles,
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:12.640]   and the circles you run in are not representative of really much of anything.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.640]   If you're talking about mainstream Democrats versus mainstream Republicans,
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:27.440]   then you're talking about people who have pretty much the same concept of justice. They believe in
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:34.320]   juries. Nobody's campaigning to say, "We gotta get rid of the jury system." You can't distinguish
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:43.360]   Democrats and Republicans on that issue. Nobody is saying that there has to be some means of
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:52.400]   centralizing power to such an extent that there has to be a vastly expanded, for example,
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:59.760]   federal department of education. It's still pretty much on the fringes. Most of the federal agencies
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:07.600]   are run by certainly full-time bureaucrats, but you don't have the degree of centralized
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:16.240]   political control that the Soviet Union had in 1970. There isn't anything like that. Americans
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:22.480]   would not affirm that. The two parties are pretty much the same on the issue of the deficits.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:30.400]   The rhetoric may be different. They vote the same. So when somebody is running for office,
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:35.920]   do you ever find a guy saying, "I don't want the Christian vote. I'm going after the atheist vote."
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:43.040]   I've never heard that. If it's there, I've never heard a campaign based on that position.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.520]   The number of people, or at least the percentage of people who claim that they
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:57.120]   are Christians is certainly in the range probably of 60 or 65 percent. People who attend church once
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:04.880]   a month maybe are probably in the range of 40 to 45 percent and so forth. The number of people who
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:10.480]   claim that they believe straight Darwinism is under 20 percent. Nobody else believes it.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:16.400]   So what I want to see is in terms of the broad mass of American voters,
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:24.480]   where is this distinction that would say, "We don't believe in the 10 commandments. We believe
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:29.760]   in some other system," or "We don't believe in God. We don't believe that God intervenes in history.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:35.680]   We don't want your prayers for my sick child who's dying of whatever."
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:45.120]   That kind of attitude has always been extremely limited in the United States and certainly
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:50.720]   limited in terms of Canadian practice. And I think it's generally not been true in Mexico either.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:32:01.840]   I think you're running in a very narrow circle, interacting with a couple of dozen people
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:05.760]   who are not representative of American culture as a whole.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:14.240]   >>AJ: I will concede your point. I find it very difficult in the modern era,
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:21.120]   especially for someone like me who spends much time alone in my office. I find it difficult to
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:27.440]   know how to avoid simply feeding my own confirmation bias with my own tiny, weird circles and how to
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:35.600]   get a grasp on what's happening broadly. And I'll grant this for you as anecdotal support for the
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:44.880]   statements you've made. I remember during the previous presidential election cycle, there was a
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:52.720]   political candidate named Austin Peterson who is an atheist or agnostic. I'm not sure how hardcore
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:59.920]   his secularism runs, but he was an atheist libertarian. And yet, he was trying to run for
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:08.960]   the libertarian ticket. He ultimately lost that attempt. But I have a much easier time with him.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:14.480]   I would have an easier time voting for him because of his positions and supporting someone like him
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:19.520]   or preferring to live under the governance of someone like him because of his positions than I
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:27.440]   do some professing evangelical Christians who run under a statist platform. So I'll offer that as
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:34.560]   anecdotal evidence to the point that you were making. >>Corey: Well, your buddy is not going
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:39.920]   to get elected, so let's eliminate him. >>AJ: He's not. Never known him, just read about him.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:45.440]   >>Corey: I'd like to ask one more theological question. I want to pivot to some practical
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:50.880]   things as we wrap up. So here's the last theological question. In all of your books,
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:57.840]   since I think as best I can discern from reading and skimming some of your work,
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:07.440]   since about the mid-'80s or late-'80s, you have seemingly structured your work in terms of a
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:14.240]   covenantal approach or the approach of the covenant. My understanding is that the framework
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:20.720]   that you use was first promoted by Ray Sutton, an associate of yours, during the 1980s,
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:26.720]   and you've adopted it and adapted all of your work to fit that particular framework. Could you
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:32.480]   first describe what that framework is before I ask a follow-up question to that, please?
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:39.760]   >>Jay: Well, in terms of social theory, there's a doctrine of sovereignty, and there's a doctrine
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:46.400]   of authority or representation. There's some system of ethics, in other words, a legal order.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:54.160]   There's a system of cause and effect. And then finally, there's a doctrine of the future.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:35:01.440]   And every social order has all five of these characteristics. You have to go looking for them
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:10.960]   in some cases, because they may not be openly stated. But sovereignty, authority, law, sanctions,
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:20.080]   and time are basic to understanding every political order, every economic system that you have
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:28.240]   anywhere in the world, because every system of thought has a doctrine of sovereignty, authority,
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:34.800]   that is representation, law, sanctions, and time. The version that
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:44.560]   Sutton was working with had been developed by a professor at Westminster Seminary in the 1960s
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:50.800]   by the name of Meredith Klein, and he got it from another professor in the 1950s who had worked on
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:36:01.920]   a similar study. His name was George Mendenhall. But the ancient treaties of the Middle East
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:08.720]   use this structure. And what I discovered and Sutton worked on and others of us worked on
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:15.840]   was that the Pentateuch is structured in terms of these five concepts, and certain books of the
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:24.480]   Bible use the five concepts, God, man, law, sanctions, and time. You can't escape the
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:29.920]   structure. Certainly, you can't escape it in terms of the Pentateuch, but I think it exists in
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:35.200]   the book of Exodus. I think it's basic to Leviticus. It's certainly true of
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.160]   Deuteronomy, and David Shilton worked on it with respect to the book of Revelation.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:47.280]   So you can't escape this basic model. So what I have done is to take that basic model on this
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.800]   assumption. If you get these five points basically correct, you have a pretty good handle on whatever
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.560]   it is you're trying to discuss. You won't get everything done. You can't get everything done.
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:03.120]   But if you don't have any one of those five concepts, you're not going to have any way to
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:11.120]   analyze accurately a particular social order or economic order. And so in terms of economics,
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:18.400]   you've got to have some concept of ownership. That's fundamental. In other words, who owns the
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:24.320]   property? And then you have the question of service, which is the free market principle of
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:30.160]   serving the consumer. You've got to have some concept of law, which says your property is going
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:37.040]   to be defended by law. That's the eighth commandment. You've got to have some concept of
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:43.360]   judgment, which means you've got to have a legal order, which is not corrupt and which enforces
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:49.120]   predictably the legal order that has been established by law. And then you've got to
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:55.920]   have a system of succession. You've got to have probably, and certainly in our order,
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:01.280]   you've got to have elections in which there is peaceful transition, where there's not a
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:08.640]   revolution every time some major political figure dies. There has to be a system of orderly
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:15.360]   judicial transition to the next generation. These are basic concepts. You've got to have
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:21.280]   an inheritance. If you can't inherit what you've built up, if you can't leave that to your children,
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:27.040]   then what's the point of building up the inheritance? Why will people sacrifice for
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:34.160]   the future if that future is going to be called into question when they die and their children
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:40.160]   want to receive whatever it is the parents have built up and the state comes in and confiscates
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:47.280]   half the property, which is what is done, at least on paper, by the American political system,
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:53.680]   but which with non-profit foundations, the super-rich have always evaded the problem.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:39:05.280]   So in your use of this covenant, I've, covenantal theology is not something that I,
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:13.840]   when after reading your use of this covenant, I went back and started trying to study in the
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:20.640]   scripture the various covenants to understand for myself from the text of scripture the
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:27.760]   implication of them. And your expression there is a little bit different than in tone, though not in
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:35.680]   substance, of kind of what I describe as covenantal theology. My question is this,
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:40.800]   do you think that somebody had, you defend a number of minority positions,
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:47.920]   minorities simply in terms of their broader acceptance in modern mainstream Protestant
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:54.320]   Christianity. You defend a number of minority positions, many of which are
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:03.840]   built around this, the tenets of this covenant or the tenets of covenantal theology. You apply
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:11.440]   this to many areas. In your opinion, is it a package deal to somebody who's studying your
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:17.680]   work and studying your particular understanding of scripture? Do they naturally have to lead to,
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.480]   if they naturally accept covenantal theology, will they naturally
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:27.760]   wind up in the various positions that you have taken, although they're a,
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:36.240]   currently a minority, or will they be able to, or can people pick and choose from some of the
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:43.440]   things that you publicly defend? Well, give me an example. Well, for example, covenantalism.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:53.120]   So you defend the doctrine, you defend, with regard to Israel, you, I mean, grasping for the
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:41:00.240]   proper term, not, what's the term meaning that God finished with Israel and is no longer working
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:07.200]   with Israel? Well, that's the fundamentalist position. Okay. But there's a, at least among
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:16.400]   some fundamentalists, that there has been a transfer of what had been the bride of God in
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:22.160]   the Old Testament, which was the nation of Israel, that has been transferred to the institutional
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:29.760]   church. Is that what you're pushing at? Yes. So in much of modern, I'm grasping for the theological
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:32.960]   term, but it's probably more helpful for my listeners for me to describe the meaning. So
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:42.240]   in much of modern Protestant Christianity, especially more evangelical and fundamentalist
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:51.520]   sects, there is a promotion of the current nation state of Israel that as being God's chosen people,
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:57.360]   because of the ethnic bloodline coming down through Abraham. You reject that in your teaching.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:03.760]   Rather, you say that God finished with Abraham and he judged Abraham in, or sorry, God finished
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:08.800]   with the Jews as an ethnic group, and that God finished with the Jews and he judged them in the
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:18.320]   year AD 70 with the destruction of Jerusalem. Now, I just recently finished reading the book,
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:25.520]   I was, I recently read a book that you wrote the editor's note to called Second Chance,
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:32.560]   which was an application of the covenantal system of theology to the question of marriage,
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:42.720]   divorce, and remarriage. And it's interesting because I follow often the logical continuation
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.840]   that you apply in applying this thinking, but I struggle with some of the particular applications.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:56.080]   So in your writings on economics, I'm very much attracted to your writing on economics because
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.640]   a lot of it makes sense. I see the connection to scripture and it's a coherent, cohesive system.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:07.680]   But yet I frankly have a difficult time with post-millennialism, although I am,
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:12.240]   well, I have a difficult time with post-millennialism. I have a difficult time
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:18.720]   with the idea of God divorcing Israel, and I study it and try to understand it and think about it,
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:23.120]   but I wonder, is this a package deal? Similarly, with- It's a package, it is a package deal.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.760]   Okay. Do you care to expand on that at all from my own understanding?
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:36.480]   Because the covenant is a package deal. You don't take four points of the covenant,
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:42.720]   you take five points of the covenant there. Five points. God is sovereign. Man is created
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:53.600]   in order to serve God and to administer the creation. Law is given by God, and man is
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:44:00.000]   responsible to God for that law. The sanctions will be applied both in history and eternity.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:10.320]   And there is over time a correlation between covenant keeping and prosperity,
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:18.320]   and there's also a correlation between covenant breaking and defeat. That goes back to Deuteronomy
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:24.240]   28. Now, if that's not true, then covenant theology is wrong. All forms of covenant
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:30.320]   theology are wrong. But then try to build a civilization on this principle, honesty is not
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:37.520]   the best policy. What civilization is going to be built on that? Now, you've got to have a
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:43.760]   definition of honesty. You've got to have a system of cause and effect that brings that
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:49.440]   truth to fruition. And you'd better have examples of societies that have followed
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:56.400]   the legal order laid down in the Bible, the basic principles, and have established court systems
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:04.800]   that defend that legal order. And if you find time and again that that kind of correlation
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:08.960]   leads to defeat in history, then covenant theology is not true.
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:15.040]   >>SA: I appreciate the clear answer. I'll have to keep thinking and studying
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:17.840]   that question for myself to resolve it.
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:22.480]   >>CW: Well, I know what—let me tell you what your problem is. I can tell right now what the
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:28.240]   problem is, and you've cited the right book. You don't have a concept of biblical divorce.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.000]   >>SA That is one fundamental, yes.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.880]   >>CW Yeah, that's right. That you have to have a—the biblical concept of divorce
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:46.800]   in the Old Testament was divorce by execution. And so Rush Duny and Bonson and Sutton come to
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:55.360]   the conclusion that if you have certain kinds of practices that would have led to the execution
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:05.680]   of the guilty party under the Mosaic law, that should allow the breaking of the covenant of
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:13.760]   marriage because you have to have the principle of victim's rights. You have to defend the victim,
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:23.840]   not the perpetrator. And on that basis, you don't split the assets of the family 50/50.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:29.760]   You take everything away from the victim—from the perpetrator. You transfer that to the victim.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:35.920]   That should be the principle that you apply, not simply in the marriage covenant. That's
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:41.200]   the principle of the church covenant. That should be the principle of the civil covenant as well.
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:47.520]   That there have to be negative sanctions imposed and that a breaking of the covenant
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:53.920]   is the equivalent of covenantal death. I don't see any way to run a family without that. Now,
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:57.520]   I'm sure you can do it as we do in the modern world with easy divorce,
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:01.920]   no-fault divorce, but then it's breaking up the family structure.
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:10.560]   That's what happened. That's what happened to Israel. It was a covenantal divorce.
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:16.960]   That's what the difference is in terms of the covenant theology versus, say,
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:24.320]   premillennial dispensational theology. It's the issue of the covenantal divorce
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:34.000]   by God of Israel. Did that take place in AD 70 or didn't it? And the systems sort out
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:42.720]   on the basis of what was the divorce and what is the appropriate sanction for the divorce.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:50.640]   Correct. So you struck to the heart of the matter, which I will affirm you are absolutely correct. I
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.200]   defend—I believe and defend, for lack of a better term, I guess the permanence view
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:05.200]   of not easy divorce but no divorce. And here's my kind of deeper structure, deeper problem.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:11.200]   I affirm that there is great value in some of the
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:19.920]   insight that can be gained from seeing something like the five points of the covenant.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:29.920]   I love to see a commentator write about the particulars, the background of a certain passage
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:35.520]   or a certain historical cultural thing. That's one of the reasons why I enjoy reading some of
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.720]   your commentary. Some of your appendices are books in and of themselves on topics that I find very
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:46.800]   fascinating but that would never have occurred to me. But it seems as though to defend covenantal
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:54.720]   theology, the simplicity, perhaps the more I think it would be accurate to say the fundamentalist
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:02.960]   approach to scripture is weakened. And I'm not defending a wooden literalism. I'm not trying to
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:09.200]   defend a wooden fundamentalist approach. But when I read a passage speaking about divorce and
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:17.120]   remarriage, when Jesus says, when asked about divorce in Matthew 19 or 5, when the Pharisees
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.680]   come to him and say, "For what reason can a man divorce his wife?" And Jesus responds and says,
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:27.360]   "Not read from the beginning. Man shall leave father and mother and be joined to his wife. And
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:31.120]   what God has joined together, let not man separate." He answers the question. And then
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:36.800]   the follow-up question goes on. And he says, "Why then did Moses permit a certificate of divorce?"
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:42.800]   And Jesus answers that and he says, "Because of the hardness of your hearts, Moses permitted
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:48.960]   divorce, but from the beginning it was not so." And there's this great impact of that from a
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:56.800]   theological perspective that you affirm and defend the various doctrines of theonomy and the binding
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:06.000]   applicability of God's law is revealed to Moses on many modern questions. And yet,
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:14.480]   the clear teaching of Jesus there is that he seems to refer to Moses as working in an unregenerate,
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:22.880]   unrepentant people. And so he's ushering in a new working and a new thing. And so I see the
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:33.280]   logical applicability. And in fact, I'm deeply attracted to some of the specific work that
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:38.800]   Sutton does in that book and that you do in some of your writings on victims' rights to defend the
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:46.480]   victim in the case of wrongdoing. And yet, I feel as though to affirm the theology or to affirm the
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:52.080]   aspects of covenantal theology would require me to deny the plain teaching of scripture and to
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:55.840]   have to tell somebody, "Well, in order to understand this, you can't take this in a simple
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:51:01.040]   way. You can't look at the New Testament and say, 'What did Jesus teach and let me apply it.' Rather,
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:06.480]   you have to have this deep understanding of 66 books of the Protestant Bible. You need to go
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:10.800]   back and understand the working of God's covenant in Deuteronomy. You need to go back and read Gary
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:16.160]   North and understand his appendices where he outlines this richness." And it puts me in a bind
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:23.680]   because I feel like the simple understanding is often lost by this application of covenantalism,
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:32.640]   which is not explicit but is drawn from the overall text. That's my personal problem that
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:40.720]   I don't know how to overcome. So don't be a wimp. Do you believe in the public execution of anybody
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:49.280]   who commits any crime listed as a capital crime in the Old Testament by which innocent parties
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:58.160]   gained divorce? I think so. But I'm not sure about the whole list. Could we restrict it to something?
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:06.960]   Rush Dooney lists it. So remember, it's on page 504 of the Institute. So the reason I think I
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:11.040]   remember that— I've been reading the Institute for the first time. I have not read all three
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:16.960]   of his books. You've got—well, you only have to read the first volume. And I think Bonson's—it
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:22.080]   occurred out it's the same page. I think it's 504 in Theonomy and Christian Ethics, depending on
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:30.000]   which typeset version you get. He's got the list. It's about 20 items. Okay, so you execute anybody
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:36.160]   who commits those items, male or female, certainly male. Well, then you don't have to have a divorce.
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:42.880]   The victimized party remarries. But Jesus didn't live in that society. Jesus lived in a Roman
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:49.440]   society. There wasn't any available divorce on that basis. So he was trying to deal,
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:57.280]   judicially speaking, with what constitutes a divorce if the person has not created
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:04.640]   a crisis situation for himself by violating one of the capital crimes, which would mean
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:10.640]   it's divorce by execution. That's what Rush Dooney talks about. Well, we don't live in that society
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:16.080]   now. Frankly, I think we're probably better if we did, but we don't. So then the question is,
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:20.720]   on what basis is there divorce? And the answer is covenantal death.
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:28.640]   That doesn't change Old Testament to New Testament. Now, what Jesus was talking about is that the
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:36.400]   Old Testament allowed them to divorce—a man could divorce his wife not for the violation of a
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:43.840]   capital crime, but because she displeased him. And that's what upset the disciples. And that is a
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:50.800]   major difference between Jesus' teaching on the family and Moses' teaching on the family.
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:57.520]   But he wasn't talking there about crimes that would have been divorced by execution. He was
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:06.000]   talking about what Moses did allow was that a wife had displeased her husband, and that was not even
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.040]   defined. And Jesus made a break with that, and the disciples said, "Wait a minute. How can you have
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:22.880]   any kind of justice in that system? Who would accept that?" Now, let's push it further. If that
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:29.920]   isn't true, tell me what the basis is. Tell me what the basis is biblically against polygamy.
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:36.880]   Because the only passage I can find in all the New Testament that challenges polygamy is
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:44.400]   indirect in that passage, in which women now are going to be protected against husbands who want
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:52.800]   to get rid of them. That's where you get protection for the wives. I don't know any other passage in
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:58.480]   Scripture in which there's anything like a statement where there is equality, and therefore,
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:04.640]   there is not to be a polygamous situation in which one wife is subservient to another wife.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:09.280]   You had it in the Old Testament. You don't have it in the New Testament. This is the passage that
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:15.600]   I would go to to try to defend the Christian concept against bigamy, because you're going
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:20.800]   to be hard-pressed to find any other passage in the Scriptures in which you can find an attack
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:27.920]   on bigamy other than this passage in which male and female are brought to equivalence
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.920]   in the marriage bond. Paul
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:40.640]   I concede your point on polygamy. I generally try not to feed that particular argument,
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:44.560]   and very rarely do I come across somebody who's knowledgeable enough on the Bible
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:50.000]   to feed and say, "Well, Joshua, talk about polygamy." But it seems as though you're forced
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:59.040]   to one of two extremes, either to the extreme that you defend and are now defending,
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:10.640]   or to the extreme of, say, radical two-kingdomism or absolute all the way to where Jesus answers
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:14.960]   it and says, "But from the beginning, it was not so," and basically cut out, as much of
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:22.400]   Protestant Christianity does, cut out much of the Old Testament, specifically the law of Moses,
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:29.120]   and kind of cut it out and ignore it as only applying to Jews. It seems like both of those
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:37.280]   extreme positions solve that problem, but I don't love either of them, and I struggle.
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:46.320]   Well, all right. Okay. Who's your third party, third movement, third position, middle way? Who's
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:53.120]   the theological, philosophical, cultural, historical defender of a middle way?
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.720]   I can't say.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:57:00.800]   Who are you going to go to? Yeah, because he doesn't exist. And that's the problem. That's
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:06.640]   been the problem in Christianity for a long time, certainly in Protestant Christianity. There's no
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:12.320]   middle position. So what happens is they just baptize the popular fad of 10 years ago.
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:14.240]   Right. Which is-
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:19.600]   Whatever that was, they buy into. Meanwhile, the humanist world has gone on to the next fad.
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:24.400]   Right. And I think you see the destruction in 2018 of many Christian churches, say,
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:29.520]   most public Christian churches in the United States of America embracing, just embracing,
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:35.200]   to use your terminology, baptized humanism, but 10 years later. And you see the destruction,
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:37.840]   I see the destruction today in our modern culture.
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:47.120]   Yeah, I think it's difficult to find the middle path because there aren't any leaders who've been
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:53.840]   on it and who've offered a philosophical defense of it. They're always quoting some humanist fad
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:58:00.080]   or some humanist philosopher and giving a little baptized language to it, but there's nothing
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:06.160]   consistent about the position. And that's why I've been doing the work in economics to provide
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:13.440]   an example. That's what Rush Duny did with at least that first volume of Institutes of Biblical
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:18.080]   Law. Do you realize that was the only book on that position for exactly 300 years?
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.600]   No.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:29.280]   Only one. Yeah, it goes back to the late 17th century with Richard Baxter, who wrote
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:38.560]   in 1673 this huge book on social philosophy. It was the last time it was attempted on that scale.
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:45.920]   And for 300 years, the Protestant church simply stopped talking about it. Rush Duny shows up 300
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:55.520]   years later as a kind of extension of Baxter, and he said, "Let's look at the text of scripture to
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:59:01.120]   try to find out what God has to say in these areas of civil government, personal government,
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:06.800]   church government, family government," which is what Baxter did in his book,
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:13.600]   A Christian Directory. But nobody had read that for almost literally 300 years. It had
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:21.760]   been a completely forgotten book. So we have this problem of making up for lost time,
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:30.400]   and it's not easy to make up for 300 years of being in the shadows, not having anything
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:37.600]   particularly Christian to say, and simply adopting whatever the predominant humanist view is
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:46.160]   that prevails around us. And that began certainly no later than about 1700 with the rise of
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:53.360]   Newtonianism and the rise of what I would call a more consistent kind of Enlightenment humanism.
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:58.720]   And some Christians went to the left-wing side, the French Revolutionary side. Some Christians,
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:06.000]   most Protestants, went to the right-wing side, Adam Smith, for example. They prefer the free
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:14.240]   market social order of Smith to the French Revolution or to some version of communist
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:23.840]   tyranny, top-down tyranny. But the point is they chose those positions based on personal preference,
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:26.560]   not based on biblical exegesis.
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:33.920]   When I was younger, I did not realize this doctrinal problem that I have. It was not
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:40.960]   until I began speaking in public here on Radical Personal Finance where I faced the inconsistencies
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:47.280]   in my own thinking. And the reason was when not speaking in public, and I don't label Radical
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:52.320]   Personal Finance as a... It's not called Christian Personal Finance for a reason. It's called
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:58.960]   Radical Personal Finance. So I don't label nor do I have any desire to work just in the context of,
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:03.920]   "Oh, this is Christian stuff and just for Christians." But on the flip side, I also don't
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:12.720]   retreat from Christian positions. I see no reason why in the public marketplace of ideas why I
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:19.040]   should be the only diverse opinion that is beaten to the back and not permitted to compete in the
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:28.160]   marketplace of ideas. And so I pull no punches about defending Christian ideology in public.
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:34.960]   I see no reason why it should be, at the very least, at the most perhaps reserved position,
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:41.680]   I see no reason why it should not be given at least the same consideration as any other
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:45.440]   philosophy or background in the public marketplace of ideas. And so I don't
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:51.840]   label what I do as speaking to Christians, etc. But what that exposed for me was a new thing that
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:02:00.320]   prior to my beginning Radical Personal Finance, I was always clear on who I was talking to.
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:05.280]   If I was speaking in a meeting of a church, it was clear that I was speaking to people who were
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:11.280]   disciples, professing disciples of Jesus. And so I could speak in a particularly Christian context.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:16.640]   If I was speaking in a public meeting or speaking in a public scenario, then it would be relatively
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:24.000]   easy to stay focused on the topic at hand and to avoid the necessary intersections of Christianity
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:29.440]   and secular humanism that governs our culture. But when speaking on my podcast, I have a mixed
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:35.600]   audience. And for the first time, I never knew who I was speaking to. And that was where I started
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:42.480]   to learn this deep conflict of, "Wait a second, are there different rules? Are there different
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:46.880]   rules for Christians and non-Christians?" which is why I have asked these questions of you.
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:49.680]   So I want to just clarify and let you answer, and then I'll go back to a couple quick things,
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:54.080]   and then we'll wrap up today. I want to go back and respond to your question on divorce. Here's my
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:03:02.720]   concern. I guess it's a subset of the, "What about the naked savage on the island who never
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.760]   has heard about Jesus" argument in Christian apologetics. But let's say that I only had
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:13.760]   the book of Mark to teach me about who Jesus was and the teachings of Jesus. Let's say that
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:18.800]   I were an early believer and I only had the book of Mark. In the book of Mark, chapter 10,
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:26.480]   in Jesus' teachings on divorce, marriage, there is... I'll just read it because I have it,
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:32.560]   and it'll be more succinct than me trying to talk about it. "And again, as was his custom,
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:37.680]   Jesus taught them. And Pharisees came up, and in order to test him, asked, 'Is it lawful for a man
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:43.360]   to divorce his wife?' He answered them, 'What did Moses command you?' They said, 'Moses allowed a
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:48.720]   man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.' And Jesus said to them, 'Because of
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:53.200]   your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment. But from the beginning of creation,
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:57.280]   God made them male and female. Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:01.520]   to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:05.760]   therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.' And in the house, the disciples asked
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:10.480]   him again about this matter. And he said to them, 'Whoever divorces his wife and marries another
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:14.480]   commits adultery against her. And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:19.440]   adultery.'" And it goes on and talks about the little children. And it's in looking at these
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.520]   letters where I recognize that if somebody only had... The question is, if somebody only had the
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:29.280]   book of Mark, would they have an accurate understanding of the teachings of Jesus?
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:34.640]   Or do they also have to go back and also have Matthew 19? Do they also have to then go back
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:40.720]   to Deuteronomy and understand what... Was it Jeremiah who rebuked... No, it was Ezra, I think,
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:46.400]   who rebuked the Israelites who had married foreign wives. Do they also have to go back to do all of
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:52.720]   this? And if they also have to go back and put this together as you have done, Dr. North, then
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:05:01.440]   it seems as though the simplicity of understanding Christian doctrine is diminished. So that's my
[02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:05.360]   specific question. What would somebody do if they only had the book of Mark?
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:11.840]   All right, go to Matthew 5, 17 through 19, and read it. You got your Bible in front of you,
[02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:16.160]   just go read it. Read it to the audience. So Matthew chapter 5...
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:27.040]   17 to 19. Correct. So Jesus is speaking and he says this, "Do not think that I have come to
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:32.400]   abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. For truly,
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:37.440]   I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot will pass from the law
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:42.160]   until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:46.560]   and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:50.800]   them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your
[02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:55.120]   righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:06:02.000]   heaven." So you better have more than the book of Mark. And that's why we do have more than the
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:10.640]   book of Mark. That's why we have 66 books. And we have to be willing to study all 66 books to see
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:17.200]   in a particular topic, if there is anything specifically presented in any of those books
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:24.000]   that applies to the topic at hand. And the early church was not in a position to do that,
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:29.440]   but the church certainly has been in a position to do it for the last 1700 years,
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:31.840]   and generally the church prefers not to do it.
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:38.080]   So on that basis, and I know, I think, I guess this is an important point, because obviously
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:42.400]   it's fundamental in my thinking. In that same chapter of Matthew, and this was my beef with
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:49.040]   Sutton's book, again, his book Second Chance, was on that same chapter of Matthew, if we drop down
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:54.960]   to verse 31, which is one of the two references in Matthew where Jesus is teaching on divorce and
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:07:00.800]   remarriage. And Jesus says this, "It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:06.400]   her a certificate of divorce.' But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:11.600]   the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:17.840]   commits adultery." So in this context then, and this was, again, I guess I'm driving at it, which
[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:23.600]   you wrote the editor's introduction to it, but this was my issue with Sutton's book, is if we
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:33.840]   assume this, and if I adopt the idea that you teach, that the law of Moses is binding on all
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:40.160]   people unless it is superseded or abrogated by a specific statement of Jesus. Is that a fair
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:43.440]   summary of what you would say about the law of Moses in your teaching on theonomy, Dr. North?
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:51.120]   I would say the major obvious break in the whole pattern of theonomic application is what you've
[02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:58.000]   just read. Jesus made a fundamental break with Moses's easy divorce position. That's why the
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:08.160]   disciples were so upset about it. That's clearly a point at which there has been a fundamental
[02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:16.080]   difference between Mosaic law and the New Testament concept of ethical and judicially
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:22.320]   valid marriage. But Sutton didn't restrict—we're getting so off of personal finance—Sutton didn't
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:28.320]   restrict— Look, you've got a problem, and you're inflicting on your listeners your personal
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:33.680]   problem. Now, we can go do this, and there are probably eight guys left out there who are
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:40.080]   listening. We can pursue it, but you have a personal problem with this particular passage.
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:46.320]   And the problem is this. You believe in victim subordination and perpetrator's rights.
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:54.560]   You believe that because that's the only way that you can maintain a zero-divorce position
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:09:00.320]   is to say that the victims must suck it up and the perpetrators are to win.
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:05.680]   There's no neutrality. There's either a victim who deserves protection,
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:10.160]   or there's a victim who must suck it up for the rest of his or her life.
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:16.080]   And my position is the victim has the rights and the perpetrator has none,
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:21.440]   and covenantal divorce is the theological basis of protecting the victim,
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:25.200]   because there's only one other alternative, and that's you protect the perpetrator.
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:33.440]   For the sake of the audience and personal finance, I'll go back to personal finance,
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:39.920]   and I'll concede that I do have my own personal understanding that I wrestle with on this.
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:45.680]   So let's go back to personal finance with three rapid-fire questions as we start.
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:50.800]   Don't give me three rapid-fire questions. Let's stick to this. Who gets the money?
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:56.320]   So the problem is—here would be my response then.
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:06.960]   I don't want to affirm perpetrator's rights, and I don't want to affirm the loss of—I
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:13.360]   don't want to affirm perpetrator's rights as contrasted against victim's rights. I want to
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:20.400]   defend consistently the victim. However, I also want to compare that with the clear teaching of
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:26.560]   the New Testament, specifically in the teaching of Jesus, of him not taking up his rights,
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:33.760]   specifically in the teachings of Paul and the victimization that he suffered, specifically
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:41.680]   in the instructions of Paul to slaves who were unjustly treated, etc., and specifically even
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:48.720]   in the context of paying taxes to an immoral government, simple things like that. There are
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:56.800]   so many instructions in the New Testament to disciples of Jesus not to stand up for their
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:09.600]   own rights that I don't want to affirm the perpetrator's rights as contrasted to the victim.
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:16.240]   But I do want to affirm that God has grace for the victim in a place of victimization,
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:22.560]   and that when a victim abandons—or when a victim, for lack of a better metaphor,
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.680]   takes up the sword, what happens is instead of it being a shame against the perpetrator,
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:36.080]   with the opportunity for the perpetrator to repent and to come back and for the perpetrator
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:41.360]   to repent, then it puts the victim in the place of the judge, and then the perpetrator has no
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:50.880]   incentive to come back. So I don't know how to apply it on a complete society-wide basis.
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:12:02.640]   But what happens is it seems as though you lose if we don't allow for the victim to know God's
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:12.000]   grace in the midst of suffering and for that expression of righteousness to be a deep and
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:20.400]   constant shame against a perpetrator, then...I'll give you an example. I know many people who are,
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:26.080]   from my own personal interaction and personal church and church experience, I know a number
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:31.360]   of people who were the victims in a marriage relationship. Specifically, let's talk about
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:36.320]   a very vulnerable person, a vulnerable woman who is the victim of her husband's immorality and
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:44.240]   adultery on her. However, even through the victimhood, even through her victimization,
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:52.720]   by the sin of her adulterous husband, she has consistently known, per personal testimony if
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:58.080]   she were here, she would give a testimony of the grace of God to be her husband through the entire
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:04.320]   process and to give her the grace of forgiveness of him. And that man, though he goes on sinning
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:12.240]   many decades later, that man will never be able to stand before God and say, "I don't know my sin,"
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:18.320]   because his wife wears her wedding ring and her righteousness is an affront to his sin.
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:25.840]   So that to me is a big part of the tone and tenor of so many passages of the New Testament is,
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:30.240]   "Why not better be wronged?" As Paul talks about in talking about Christians suing one another.
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:36.240]   He says, "Why would you not rather better be wronged?" And so for Christians, I can clearly
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:41.680]   and confidently proclaim that. The problem comes down to this question of the social order, which
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:45.680]   is, of course, what you're tackling in your work. It comes down to the question of, "Well, what
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:53.200]   about a social order that includes believers and non-believers, to use your terminology, covenant
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:57.600]   keepers and non-covenant keepers? What about a social order that includes these things? How do
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:02.720]   we deal justly with those?" Which is why you get this bifurcation between two kingdoms theology,
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:09.280]   kind of a radical pietism, a radical two kingdoms theology versus as contrasted, so that there
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:15.440]   becomes a separation. And I can see that there are difficult passages. Your writing is strong on that.
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:21.360]   But that's my concern is I don't want to affirm perpetrators' rights, but I also see even in the
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:28.800]   actual example of Jesus and his atonement on the cross, him laying down his rights and his judicial
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:38.160]   place of superiority for the sake of something greater. That would be my response to your question.
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:45.920]   Well, the sons of the woman you describe are being sent a message.
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:51.920]   And they're being sent a message because most sons imitate their fathers, not their
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:56.160]   mothers. And the message is I can get away with murder and nothing's going to happen to me.
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:03.840]   In Britain in the 19th century, if there was a divorce, the husband automatically got the children.
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:11.760]   And the husband was probably an adulterer. And the reason was very clear. Women would not leave
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:18.400]   their kids if they were going to lose the kids, so they put up with the husband. And also went the
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:23.360]   other way, so the husbands really didn't want to have all the responsibility of the kids if the
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:31.760]   wife left. And so on a very practical basis, British government for hundreds of years
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:37.040]   kept the families together based on the principle of perpetrators' rights.
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:44.000]   And it worked, highly practical, kept the families together and the wives had to put up with it.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.720]   That I don't think is what Jesus taught.
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:57.360]   You're a pietist and yet you're schizophrenic. You're intellectually schizophrenic. Rush
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:02.320]   Duney wrote the book with that title. You are in the position of virtually all American
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:06.960]   Protestant Christians today. You don't want to make a break with either system.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:13.360]   And that's why right down the middle, there isn't anybody or almost there are no people who go right
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:18.880]   down the middle and say, well, we can build a whole Christian philosophy without making a break.
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:24.400]   Well, they do make a break. Kingdom, two kingdoms philosophy is one, pietism is one.
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:34.160]   I'm working on building the Christian case for a Christian social order. It's not my job to get
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:39.440]   everybody to believe it. I'm just wanting to get them to believe that they have to make a decision.
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:45.200]   They have to fish or cut bait, as my mother-in-law used to say. And most Christians don't want to do
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:52.720]   either. And that's why we're in the situation we're in. It ultimately is a position that says
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:58.160]   perpetrators' rights. And we live in a society in which perpetrators' rights is the dominant
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:05.440]   philosophy operationally of the day. And socialism is perpetrators' rights.
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:14.800]   It's what it is. It's the thou shalt not steal except by majority vote. And the perps attempt
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:19.520]   to get the money. Of course, it backfires and the super rich get richer and richer and richer
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:24.480]   because they know how to beat the system. And the average voter does not. But he thinks he's
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:32.560]   going to beat the system. And we have built a social order since probably 1890s, 1895, that era
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:38.560]   with the rise of the social gospel and the rise of the progressive movement. We've built a whole
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:44.400]   social order based on perpetrators' rights. And I think it's time to break with it. But you can't
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:48.320]   just break with it in economics. You're going to have to break with it across the board.
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:59.840]   Thus my question of it being a complete system. Because pietism works within the context of
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:07.200]   premillennialism, be it dispensational premillennialism or historic premillennialism.
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:11.120]   It doesn't work in the context of postmillennialism. The task that you've--
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:14.880]   Go ahead. Yeah, but the world isn't premillennial.
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:19.040]   I can see that. It's never been premillennial. It's amillennial.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:25.520]   That's been the Catholic position. That's the Lutheran position. That's the bulk of the Dutch
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:32.480]   Calvinist tradition. The tradition of the world is not a premillennial position, which is a
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:38.560]   position which has only been defended publicly on a widespread basis in the United States
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:45.200]   since the 1880s. It's an oddball position. Historic premillennialism has had almost no
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:53.520]   defenders. The world, the kingdom, two kingdoms philosophy is amillennial. And that's real clear.
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:19:03.760]   And that position is Deuteronomy 28 cannot possibly be true. And that either the rich
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:10.720]   get richer and the rich are unrighteous and they get richer, or it's a random position which
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:16.320]   covenant breakers and covenant keepers, it's flipping coins as to who wins and who loses.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:23.440]   But don't assume that premillennialism has been a position that has been widely defended
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:30.000]   historically because almost nobody has ever held it. And the same thing is true of postmillennialism.
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:38.480]   The broad mass of humanity within the Christian church has been amillennial from day one,
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:42.080]   or almost day one, certainly from Augustine's work,
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:47.760]   the city of God, most of Christianity has been amillennial.
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:58.000]   Yeah, I've wrestled the last few years with eschatology and I'm unclear on
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:06.240]   where I personally, I'm unclear on my own personal conviction at present. It's been a difficult,
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:11.120]   a difficult journey for me that I've really wrestled with a lot over the last few years.
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:13.440]   I guess--
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:14.880]   Well, keep wrestling.
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:20.800]   Indeed I will. I guess the one comment, just to kind of conclude this,
[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:27.840]   well, let me ask it in the context of a question. So preamble to the question. Throughout history
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:34.240]   and in the recorded history of the Bible, I'm thinking, for example, of Peter when he was jailed
[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:44.480]   and then the angel came at night and released him. So for my non-Bible reading listeners,
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:49.520]   there's an account written in the book of Acts where the apostle Peter is thrown into jail by
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:53.760]   the Jewish leaders that day because he was preaching about Jesus. In the middle of the night,
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:21:00.320]   the early disciples are praying for Peter and an angel appears in Peter's jail cell,
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:06.240]   essentially blinds the guards and opens the door. Peter goes to the house of his friends
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:13.600]   and there's a quite humorous account recorded in the book of Acts where his friends, a servant girl
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:18.640]   within the household comes and opens the door and is so shocked to see Peter's face, she slams the
[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:24.160]   door in his face and goes back in because she thinks she's seen the ghost or his angel. Meanwhile,
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:28.160]   the people inside say, "Go back and open the door," and they open the door. So whether it's
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:33.600]   in a biblical account like that one where Peter's in jail and he's released by an angel of God from
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:39.600]   jail, or whether it's an account like the many miraculous occurrences that are recorded in a
[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:44.880]   place like communist China over the last 40 years. I remember reading a book called The Heavenly Man
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:56.000]   or Brother Yoon recounts a similar account where he is jailed for preaching by the communist
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:01.520]   government. He's many experiences, he's beaten, he's jailed multiple times entirely unjustly.
[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:09.040]   But then during one context, an angel appears to him while he's in jail, literally blinds the
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:13.840]   eyes of the guard so that he can walk through, my memory doesn't give me the exact number, but
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:19.360]   three or four levels of security in the prison. And he's transported physically over the walls
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:23.680]   of the prison where there's a waiting taxi sitting there and waiting for him, an entirely supernatural
[02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:28.640]   divine intervention of God in human history for that individual person.
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:36.560]   So I find that the history of Christian testimony is filled with these types of supernatural
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:45.520]   victory of the victim in the context of difficult circumstances. And so it's not difficult for me,
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:52.880]   in the light of the whole tenor and tone of the New Testament, to affirm victim's rights,
[02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:59.520]   but also to affirm that God is the ultimate one who takes vengeance on the perpetrator. And that
[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:05.760]   vengeance of God on the perpetrator is far worse than any vengeance of society around.
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:13.600]   So in the context of that, my question, Dr. North, is how do you reconcile the so many
[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:21.040]   testimonies of Christians being willing to be victimized for the sake of the gospel
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:27.200]   with what you've discussed? How do you reconcile those things? Do you deny one of those other?
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:29.240]   How do you reconcile that? >>
[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:38.720]   I think what I would say is very clear. The wife who's dealing with a drunken husband,
[02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:45.360]   she doesn't need him to be blinded. She's not blocked by the walls,
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:53.600]   but she probably ought to go out the front door and get that taxi. She doesn't need a miracle to
[02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:58.160]   get her into the taxi. She just needs common sense to say, "I'm going to defend myself
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:06.480]   and my children against this perverse man I have married. I'm going to take myself and my children
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:13.920]   out of his jurisdiction, and I'm leaving." And the church should back her up with that departure.
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:20.400]   Now let's go to the Lord's prayer. "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name." Okay.
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:28.560]   "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done." And now we get to the bottom line,
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:34.960]   "On earth as it is in heaven." Do you believe that that prayer is going to be fulfilled?
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:41.040]   >> Yes. >> When? In history or eternity?
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:45.360]   >> I believe in history. >> You're a post-millennialist.
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:52.400]   >> [laughs] Which is, of course, my challenge. But then we get to the question of what does it
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:56.240]   mean for it to be fulfilled? What does it look like in history? Is it now being fulfilled? And
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:01.280]   that's where I would draw a bifurcation. Then why then does Paul draw a distinction in Corinthians
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:10.800]   behind what is appropriate in the church versus the state at that time? Why does he draw a
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:18.160]   special bifurcation about believers suing one another in the church if it's all a matter of
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:24.080]   the social system of the secular, of the, let me avoid that word secular, of the state, however it
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:32.160]   be? >> Good principle. You don't sue the guy in the state because it's a satanic state dealing
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:38.160]   with the Roman Empire. You don't take a guy into a judge who is part of a legal order that's
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:46.800]   corrupt. Is that true in a Christian social order? Paul wrote that before AD 70. In a Christian
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:54.240]   social order in which biblical law is enforced, why wouldn't you take him before a godly judge
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:26:01.840]   in a godly social order, godly legal order? He's broken the law. Okay, here's how we do it. We
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:08.800]   create a thing called a corporation. And so corporations sue each other because they're
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:14.320]   not members of churches, but the financial results are going to be the same, basically,
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:21.280]   not much difference. You can create all kinds of ways around it, but the bottom line is this,
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:29.520]   "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven," which means it isn't done that way yet,
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:37.520]   and so you pray that it will be done that way at some point. And the amillennialist does not
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:41.680]   believe that can be fulfilled in history. The premillennialist believes it can only
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:47.600]   be fulfilled in history when Jesus returns with the angels to set up an international top-down
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:53.200]   bureaucracy, probably with headquarters at Jerusalem, or if not Jerusalem, then Colorado
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:27:01.280]   Springs. But the reality of it is, if you don't believe that's going to be fulfilled in history
[02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:05.760]   and cannot be fulfilled in history, then you're a two-kingdoms man and you're amillennial.
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:19.760]   So bringing it back then to the very example of Jesus, do you affirm or do you—Paul,
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:26.480]   when preaching about Jesus in Paul's letters, I can't cite the exact one off the top of my head,
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:37.200]   but Paul talks about how Jesus' death looked like a defeat, and yet for God it was a victory.
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:43.440]   So what looked like defeat in Jesus' death on the cross was actually victory.
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:52.480]   Did Jesus have victory or did he have defeat in history and how did that look?
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:58.000]   And of course, it's a leading question, so let me just clarify it and allow you to respond.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:09.120]   Sometimes I think what looks like success may not be a success. And here we could go through
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:13.680]   much of Christian history over the last 2,000 years, and I think there are times—let me just
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:19.120]   use the example from our earlier conversation. What looks like success in Mexico with a broad
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:24.800]   Catholic population, a significant, perhaps majority, percentage of the people who would
[02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:30.000]   affirm and say, "Yes, I'm a Christian," in reality, based upon our earlier conversation,
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:38.080]   looks less successful than perhaps the less affirming society of Canada. So what looks like
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:43.280]   success sometimes may not actually be success, and yet what is actually successful may sometimes not
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:48.480]   look like success, as in the example of Jesus. So where Jesus—
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:50.560]   Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:50.960]   Go ahead.
[02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:54.480]   You're talking about the crucifixion.
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:54.800]   Correct.
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:57.200]   What about the resurrection?
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:03.920]   It was a success and it was clear and visible to all who saw Jesus.
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:05.760]   And what about the ascension?
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:08.080]   A success, clear and visible.
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:12.560]   Right. That's the pattern. That's the pattern.
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:13.520]   So—
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:20.800]   Thy will be done on earth, or in earth, if you're going to use King James, as it is in
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:26.160]   heaven. There's a prayer. Why would he ask us to pray that if he has no intention of
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:27.200]   fulfilling the prayer?
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:36.080]   Okay, so I concede your point. Now, let's go back to—and I never, of course, I never
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:39.040]   intended to get into divorce or remarriage here, but let's go back to this question
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:47.200]   that you talked about of an abusive and sinning husband. I affirm the need to protect the
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:51.200]   wife and children from that man, and here's where it's very important that we get involved,
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:51.760]   especially—
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:57.520]   Wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's "we"? Who is "we"?
[02:29:57.520 --> 02:30:01.920]   Any person who is involved in the situation and aware of somebody being victimized.
[02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:06.240]   And you're going to give that person advice?
[02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:08.640]   Yes. I'm saying you should seek to protect the victim.
[02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:11.280]   Tell me the advice you're going to give to that wife.
[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:17.600]   Okay, so in that context, I will then go to 1 Corinthians chapter 7, and this would be
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:24.800]   where, in my mind, you have an amplification, a New Testament amplification of what it
[02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:32.800]   means of marriage. So Paul, speaking in 1 Corinthians chapter 7, he says this in verse
[02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:40.000]   10, "To the married I give this charge, not I, but the Lord, the wife should not separate
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:48.000]   from her husband. But if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:53.760]   her husband, and the husband should not divorce his wife." Now, let me go on. "To the
[02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:59.920]   rest I say, I, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she consents
[02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:05.840]   to live with him, he should not divorce her. If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever
[02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:11.040]   and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:15.520]   is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her
[02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:20.000]   husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. But
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.640]   if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases, the brother or sister
[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:29.840]   is not enslaved. God has called you to peace. For how do you know, wife, whether you will
[02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:34.160]   save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? Only let
[02:31:34.160 --> 02:31:38.880]   each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him and to which God has called
[02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:44.000]   him. This is my rule in all the churches." So, I use that and say, I don't believe there
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:50.000]   is a contradiction between affirming, stopping, let's just stick with the physical battering
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:54.800]   of a wife or children. That should be stopped because that's a physical violence that needs
[02:31:54.800 --> 02:32:02.880]   to be stopped. And if the unbelieving husband separates, the wife is not enslaved. Paul
[02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:09.120]   says the wife should not separate from her husband, but if she does, she should remain
[02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:13.840]   unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. So, let's assume that that wife is able
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:19.520]   to bear the burden that God has called her to, as we says, only let each person lead
[02:32:19.520 --> 02:32:24.000]   the life that the Lord has assigned to him. None of us get to choose. God may very well
[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:30.640]   ordain and decree that tomorrow my wife is in a car accident and I care of the rest of
[02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:35.520]   my life for her. You're battling cancer right now. We don't get to choose these circumstances
[02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:40.000]   into which we're called, but God can give us the grace in those situations. And so,
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:46.400]   I have observed testimony of, personally, a wife who is separated from her husband.
[02:32:47.840 --> 02:32:53.840]   She remains unmarried because the scripture says that she must either, if she does, she
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:59.600]   should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. That husband, by virtue of
[02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:05.600]   the godly righteous testimony of his wife, is brought to a place of repentance. He repents,
[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:10.240]   and here I would bring in godly wisdom on behalf of those who are involved in the situation
[02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:14.960]   to make sure that there is fruit of repentance, a genuine lasting fruit of repentance through
[02:33:14.960 --> 02:33:19.040]   a period of time, and then she's restored to his wife. And I've seen husbands and wives
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:25.520]   in that situation give testimony of God's saving grace in that circumstance. So, I don't see a
[02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:33.120]   disconnect between affirming protecting the victim, but also affirming that God's love can
[02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:40.560]   go even to the point where if we are victimized, we can still love in the midst of those circumstances.
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:45.360]   >>DAVID:
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:50.880]   They beat—the guy gets drunk every Saturday night, comes home, and beats the wife,
[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:58.080]   puts her life in danger. Then he beats the kids, puts their lives in danger.
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:00.960]   What's your advice to that wife?
[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:04.960]   >>ASHKAHN: The wife and children should be separated from the husband.
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:13.840]   >>DAVID: And she cannot remarry and get a righteous father for those children.
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:21.120]   >>ASHKAHN: Based on these scriptures, I don't see any way that such remarriage could be affirmed.
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:25.200]   Jesus was very clear that remarriage is adultery in his teaching.
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:30.160]   >>DAVID: In the Old Testament, they would have executed him for battery.
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:31.120]   >>ASHKAHN: Right.
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:36.240]   >>DAVID: So you're saying that because we live in an age of grace,
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:39.280]   grace has disappeared for the victim.
[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:47.200]   >>ASHKAHN: Of course, this is the heart of what I'm wrestling with. Let me go back to the next
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:52.640]   question, which does connect, and I'll give you the chance to clarify. Let's talk about the
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:53.760]   question of taxation.
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:56.320]   >>DAVID: Now, wait a minute!
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:57.600]   >>ASHKAHN: Let me connect it, please.
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:01.360]   >>DAVID: Man, it's like I'm watching a dancing master!
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:04.640]   >>ASHKAHN: [laughs]
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:09.200]   I wonder now if I should have made the promise to you that I would release our podcast unedited.
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:13.920]   Let me just simply say this.
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:15.040]   >>DAVID: Now, listen.
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:15.360]   >>ASHKAHN: Go ahead.
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:23.680]   >>DAVID: Listen. You're dropping the text, man. Verse 10 of 1 Corinthians 7. Read that text.
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:28.320]   >>Text on screen: "To the married I give this charge, not I but the Lord, the wife should not
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:28.320]   separate..."
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:31.440]   >>DAVID: Stop! Stop! Read it again.
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:35.360]   >>Text on screen: "To the married I give this charge, not I but the Lord..."
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:42.320]   >>DAVID: Okay? This is the one passage in all of the Scripture that is not legally binding.
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:45.440]   >>ASHKAHN: How do you mean?
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:47.920]   >>DAVID: Because it's not from the Lord!
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:55.920]   This is his personal opinion, and you've gotten to that passage.
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:01.680]   The one passage in which he says this is not from the Lord...
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:03.520]   >>ASHKAHN: Verse 12 says that, not verse 10.
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:06.880]   >>DAVID: I'm looking at verse 10, which you're quoting.
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:08.800]   >>ASHKAHN: Verse 10 says, "To the married I..."
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:09.840]   >>DAVID: Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. You're right.
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:10.880]   >>ASHKAHN: 12 says that.
[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:13.360]   >>DAVID: I'm going... I'm sorry. You're right. Okay.
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:15.280]   "To the rest I say, 'I, not the Lord.'"
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:22.720]   You have this situation in... Again, you are... It's for one, he is...
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:28.720]   This is not judicially binding, okay? Because it's his opinion.
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:32.560]   It is not from the Lord. But let's back it up.
[02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:40.080]   You're still in the position of affirming perpetrators' rights.
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:47.520]   Now, you can dance, you can shuffle, you can tap dance across the stage.
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:50.240]   You are still affirming perpetrators' rights.
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:52.480]   You have to come to grips with the doctrine,
[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:56.560]   the biblical doctrine that Sutton describes and Rush Gunny holds,
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:00.720]   of divorce covenantally, covenantal divorce.
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:03.760]   And covenantal divorce is covenantal death.
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:08.000]   The Old Testament, the guy would have been executed,
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:11.600]   but not in the New Testament,
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:16.800]   because we don't live under a Christian social order in which those laws are enforced.
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:20.560]   So you have to have some kind of protection for the wife.
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:23.120]   And the answer to it, the answer to it is,
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:26.640]   she better get out of there and get her kids in a safe situation
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:29.920]   and get a good father and a supporter for that...
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:35.200]   For those children and for herself, because the courts probably won't enforce it.
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:37.200]   And the church surely won't enforce it.
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:43.680]   So how is that woman going to survive if she cannot remarry?
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:51.120]   Because she's living with a man who should be, biblically speaking, executed,
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:54.320]   but it isn't possible in this society.
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:38:01.120]   So God says, you have the right of divorce on the basis of covenantal death.
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:04.080]   The guy is dead.
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:09.360]   He's violated the rules of marriage.
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:14.240]   And that can happen with the woman doing it too.
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:19.200]   How about the case of the man who leaves the wife?
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:22.560]   Is there a legitimate divorce there?
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:25.060]   No.
[02:38:25.060 --> 02:38:28.720]   Well, let's put it this way.
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:32.320]   You've said the Catholic church is wrong.
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:35.200]   You've said all of Protestantism is wrong.
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:37.920]   The libertarians aren't paying any attention to you.
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:40.640]   Other than you, who holds this position?
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:42.960]   I know a number of people who do,
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:46.960]   including all the people that I'm involved with in my local church.
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:49.760]   So I don't deny that it's a minority position.
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:50.480]   Are they?
[02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:55.200]   Okay, who do they go to to defend this position theologically?
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:57.920]   And is it an independent church?
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:38:58.800]   And I'll bet it is.
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:01.200]   What do you mean by independent church?
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:04.800]   Does it answer to any hierarchy judicially?
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:06.080]   Yeah, there you got it.
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:09.840]   Okay, you're an independent guy in an independent church.
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:14.320]   You answer to nobody, and the perps are protected.
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:15.600]   But hold on a second, Dr. North.
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:24.320]   I think you hold positions which are in the extreme minority of public,
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:28.480]   prominent Protestant Christianity, and you've defended that.
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:30.400]   Not on the position of divorce.
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:31.600]   Correct. Not on this position.
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:36.400]   What I'm saying is, it's at least intellectually possible that you could hold a position
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:42.080]   that is in the minority and be right, and that I could hold a position on this and also be right.
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:42.800]   It's possible.
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:47.120]   But see, it's possible, but look.
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:55.680]   When any man stands against the tradition of the church, he's on thin ice.
[02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:57.520]   And I understand that with myself.
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:04.000]   But you're in a situation in which you have taken a stand against the entire history of the church.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:07.200]   You are not in thin ice.
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:08.640]   You've gone through the ice.
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:11.280]   I would deny that on this basis.
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:14.880]   First, you ask, what do you look for for theology?
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:18.960]   I'm quoting the clear scripture, which I think seem fairly clear.
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:25.040]   Now, any listener or reader would have to judge for themselves, and each person I would defend
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:33.840]   is able to make their own judgment on the teaching of scripture, because I'm not seeking to have
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:35.680]   anybody stand before me and be judged on me.
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:37.040]   I'm saying we all stand before God.
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:46.560]   So my defense is these particular biblical passages that I'm quoting.
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:48.560]   That's my defense for a theologian.
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:51.680]   Now, we have to, of course, understand, apply, et cetera.
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:57.520]   We're not going to find a direct application for every point.
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:02.240]   We have to apply the teaching, or to use your terminology, we'd have to apply the case law
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:06.800]   to a system, which is what you are doing and what I'm seeking to try to do as well.
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:15.200]   Now, the second thing is, I don't see how this is a historical theological minority,
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:20.960]   considering that the position that I'm defending is, in essence, the official teaching of the
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:27.520]   Catholic Church today, even though their system of annulling a marriage has become, in my opinion,
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:29.520]   a mockery in the modern world.
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:35.600]   And I was struck by watching part of the series of The Crown that was produced by Netflix,
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:41.600]   and I was really struck at the inception of The Reign of Queen Elizabeth, how her predecessor,
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:50.080]   I think it was Edward, the guy who was bound to be king at that time, he was called, but
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:57.600]   in the land of Britain, he abdicated the throne because of his professed desire to marry a
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:41:58.720]   divorcee.
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:02.960]   Now, I don't know what the circumstances of her divorce were, but I was struck by seeing
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:08.880]   that in The Crown, and then to compare that against the news from this last year of 2018,
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:16.800]   where the next royal marriage is set to occur, or has occurred, between a divorcee, and yet
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:24.240]   nobody, including, seemingly nobody in British society wants to take a stand against that.
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:27.600]   And yet that was the very reason why Queen Elizabeth came to power.
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:31.680]   So I don't think I'm in the minority, I may be in the minority position, I am in the minority
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:34.480]   position today, I certainly seem to be that.
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:38.960]   But by all accounts, I look around at the mainstream Protestant position, and I don't
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:42.960]   see much success in maintaining marriages under any ground.
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:46.960]   Even if we grant an exception for divorce, perhaps we grant a so-called exception for
[02:42:46.960 --> 02:42:54.960]   abandonment, I don't hear any Protestant, I am not aware of many Protestant churches
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:59.200]   who would even take a book like Ray Sutton's and try to apply it.
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:04.720]   What I see to the left and right of me is thousands and thousands of people who trundle
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:10.480]   into church buildings and trundle out of church buildings with very little applicability of
[02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:13.920]   trying to understand even what Sutton teaches to their marriage.
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:17.680]   And I see the consequences of that worked out today in marriages all over the place,
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:25.120]   where I know plenty of people, those same, for example, those same liberation theologians
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:31.600]   would happily affirm homosexual relationships and homosexual marriages as entirely according
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:33.840]   to God's plan.
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:39.720]   I see it left and right of many people who happily affirm fornication with no marriage
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:40.720]   vows.
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:47.040]   And so I don't have a high opinion of, and I can trace that back to the dissolution of
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:50.840]   this particular doctrine, and I can affirm that we have problems, but I don't have that
[02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:55.800]   much of a high opinion to say that somehow marriage that allows for divorce in case of
[02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:01.240]   adultery or wife battering, et cetera, that somehow that's going to stand the test of
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:05.520]   the homosexual activists on our doorstep today.
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:08.920]   So I'll give you the last word on this to wrap up.
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:13.480]   I'll give you the last word, Dr. North.
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:15.000]   You're an amazing dancer.
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:19.240]   I love to see a guy with footwork like yours.
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:21.720]   What do you tell the wife?
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:24.120]   God's grace is sufficient.
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:31.520]   Victim, loss, perpetrators, rights.
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:33.680]   And I think we ought to end it on that.
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:34.680]   Deal.
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:37.200]   You've written an entire book on the subject, victims' rights.
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:43.080]   Please share with my audience a little bit about your books, your website, some of the
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:46.800]   things that you have available that may be helpful with a special emphasis on personal
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:47.800]   finance.
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:50.200]   Well, just go to the site.
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:53.080]   There's a large section of the site that's free.
[02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:59.680]   You can download hundreds, maybe not hundreds, maybe 150 books, something like that.
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:01.000]   A lot of books, free.
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.160]   You can download and print them out.
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:08.680]   There are sections on personal finance and so forth, not investment advice.
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:12.100]   That's part of the subscription section of the site.
[02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:17.920]   But if you want to pursue these topics, you can go to the site.
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:22.720]   You can look up the particular topic under Christian economics, or there's Gary North's
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:25.440]   free books, which is well-named.
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:26.440]   They're all free books.
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:30.860]   You can go in and look at the various titles that are available.
[02:45:30.860 --> 02:45:34.680]   And you can download all of them free of charge if you want to do that.
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:36.800]   So that's what the site's there to do.
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:40.200]   And it's been up, I guess, now about 12 years.
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:44.480]   So a lot of people have downloaded a lot of books over the years, and you might as well
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:48.280]   do it if any of these topics are really of interest to you.
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:53.760]   I will link in the show notes directly to your recent books on Christian economics,
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:56.040]   the student's manual and the teacher's edition.
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:46:00.840]   And Dr. North, I'll say to you publicly here, I do want to thank you and appreciate you
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:10.160]   for your willingness to stand for the difficult, unpopular doctrines that you believe or that
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:15.520]   you teach, the convictions that you hold in the face of much public scrutiny.
[02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:19.560]   I don't know if it comes easier for you than for me, but I have always found it very difficult
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:25.800]   to be in a minority position and to publicly be pilloried for those positions.
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:31.120]   And I take comfort in watching the testimony of other men, especially older men like you,
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:36.600]   who have withstood the flood of abuse for many decades and have stayed true to what
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:37.600]   you see.
[02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:42.280]   So thank you for your willingness to stand for and clearly proclaim what you believe
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:43.280]   and why you believe it.
[02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:44.280]   I appreciate that.
[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:45.280]   All right.
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:46.280]   Very good.
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:50.200]   I hope you enjoyed that discussion with Dr. North.
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:56.720]   And certainly I would imagine it was provocative and I hope engaging for you.
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:02.460]   On the discussion regarding divorce, marriage, remarriage, I don't wish to discuss it further
[02:47:02.460 --> 02:47:07.500]   at this point in time here other than to simply send you back to your Bible and your knees.
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:12.320]   The end of life, we stand alone before God, not before one another.
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:15.000]   And you're not accountable to me or to Dr. North.
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000]   You and I are accountable only to God.
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:20.640]   So I send you back to your Bible and to your knees.
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:27.800]   I will say this, that in our conversation, we touched on some of the most difficult,
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:32.560]   difficult things, most hotly debated topics.
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:37.900]   And so what I would commend to you is that if you have a source of significant disagreement
[02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:42.760]   on some of the moral issues, theological issues, even political issues, I would refer you before
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:51.800]   you write emails to me or Dr. North or post comments that are just short and angry, go
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:55.640]   and spend some time reading because it's very hard, especially on these topics.
[02:47:55.640 --> 02:47:58.400]   It's very hard when there have been serious thinkers who've written tens of thousands
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:47:59.400]   of pages.
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:06.340]   It's of course hard in an ad hoc interview like this to answer all of the criticisms
[02:48:06.340 --> 02:48:08.420]   and the responses and the rebuttals.
[02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:13.040]   So please, I urge you, go and spend some time doing some reading before just simply responding
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:16.740]   to let me know how upset you are.
[02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:19.580]   Go and read Dr. North's books on Christian economics.
[02:48:19.580 --> 02:48:24.280]   All of them are free, available for you free, which is fantastic.
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:25.280]   Download them, read them.
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:30.440]   I think you will learn something and whether you agree or disagree, you will be challenged
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:32.440]   and that is an excellent thing.
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:36.640]   As we go, ad for today is Samaritan Ministries.
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:42.160]   You know, in this conversation with Dr. North, obviously we're talking about Christian economics
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:48.080]   and I can think of no better company to talk to you about today than Samaritan Ministries
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:55.920]   because they are a company that is based explicitly on trying to apply Christian principles to
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:49:00.360]   a modern business problem, that is how to get healthcare for your family.
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:03.920]   Health insurance is a very challenging area.
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.960]   It's especially a challenging area if you try to walk uprightly and morally and support
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:13.800]   with your money things that you believe in because there are a number of things that
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:17.640]   are paid for by health insurance that are very hard and good conscience to contribute
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:18.640]   your money to.
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:24.120]   Well, Samaritan Ministries, which is not health insurance, is one way of possibly helping
[02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:30.960]   you to maximize your ability to protect yourself and your family from large unexpected medical
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:38.520]   expenses while minimizing your involvement in things that are unethical or immoral.
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:44.160]   Samaritan Ministries is a healthcare sharing program and what they do is they allow their
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:50.840]   members to share health needs with one another in a way that functions similarly to health
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:53.480]   insurance, although again, it is not health insurance.
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:57.520]   You'll hear them say that about a bazillion times and I will say that and emphasize it
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:00.880]   as well so that you know it is not health insurance.
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:05.080]   It's important because you don't want to be regulated under the health insurance law.
[02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:08.880]   So if you're looking for an alternative to your current health insurance plan, if you're
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:14.800]   looking for something that might work well for you, then go and check out Samaritan Ministries.
