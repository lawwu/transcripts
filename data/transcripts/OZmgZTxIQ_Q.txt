[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.240]   This question comes from Raj.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.080]   Raj asks, how do you think about earnings
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.440]   across your various income streams?
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.840]   And what's your philosophy of personal finance?
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.560]   Well, Raj, I'm all in on crypto.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.320]   All my money's in crypto.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.760]   I think that is the key.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.400]   Next question.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.640]   No, I do not have money in crypto.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.120]   How do I think about personal finance?
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.200]   I am incredibly wary of lifestyle creep.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.280]   If you live in a big city like I do in DC,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.800]   you just know a lot of people.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.480]   Or if you went to a fancy college like I went to,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.600]   you just know a lot of people that have been
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.400]   snared by lifestyle creep.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.920]   Make more money, increase the cost of my lifestyle.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.040]   Ooh, nice stuff.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.520]   Make even more money.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.360]   I'm going to increase a little bit further.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.360]   Move to this nicer house.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.440]   Get this nicer car.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.680]   Get that second house.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.360]   And it creeps, creeps, creeps.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.600]   And then you're spending all your money.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.760]   You're stressed out, and you're stuck in your job.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.560]   So I'm worried about that.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.640]   I also have this mindset of everything can go away.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.920]   So nothing scares me more than having a huge outlay
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.200]   I would have to meet every month just
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.840]   to keep our lifestyle rolling.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.280]   And that if that money went away, that would be a problem.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.720]   We couldn't afford a mortgage on our giant house anymore.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.960]   We couldn't make the car payments, et cetera.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.520]   So I'm a big believer in you fix a lifestyle
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.120]   that you really enjoy, that matches your deep life
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.920]   buckets, where you live, and how you spend your time.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.520]   You want to come up with a lifestyle that you really like.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.360]   And then don't inflate it.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.840]   So if you end up making more money
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.680]   than you need to support that lifestyle, you save it.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.600]   That's the general philosophy.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.640]   Now, of course, upgrades will happen to this image,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.800]   especially early on.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.640]   So I do not live today the way I lived
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.200]   when I was a first-year grad student.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.720]   I don't live today even the way I
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.520]   lived when my wife and I first--
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.240]   we first moved to DC.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.080]   So you can do some--
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.880]   you do some upgrades to this vision,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.840]   but you're very careful, very conservative about it.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.920]   This is just my approach.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.040]   I'm just telling you how I think about it.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.160]   And then the money that comes in excess to that, for the most
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.600]   part, you save.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.400]   And then I think from a stress perspective,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.480]   it's fantastic because you don't feel like you're
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.360]   right on this line, that if anything goes wrong,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.600]   if someone loses their job, if you have to--
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.760]   like I might--
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.080]   hey, I'm not going to take summer salary this summer
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.920]   as a professor.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.360]   It's not going to be-- that's a huge catastrophic problem.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.840]   So that's the way I think about it.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.440]   And then what do I do with that savings?
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.720]   Well, I mean, in my position, I'm
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.440]   a huge believer in investing in yourself.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.680]   So I put a lot of--
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.640]   the best investment you can make if you happen
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.600]   to be in an entrepreneurial-type field like I am
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   is usually in yourself.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.360]   So I invest--
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.920]   I am not skittish to invest in let's build out the podcast.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   I pay for my summer salary now out of my own book earnings
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.880]   so that I can write more.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.400]   Because writing more actually then returns a lot more income,
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.160]   things like this.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.600]   Invest in a new--
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.400]   whatever-- web presence for your business.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.080]   So I'm really big in investing in myself
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.440]   because those payments really do-- that really pays off.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.360]   And beyond that, I am boring.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   I'm a bogglehead, passive index.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.000]   You're not going to beat the market.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.240]   Your guy you know is not going to beat the market.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.080]   This person that does derivatives for you
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   is not beating the market.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.040]   You're not rich enough to have access
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.200]   to the people that have access to the things that's
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.620]   going to let them beat the market.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.440]   So let's not worry about it.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.520]   Index funding-- we have a guy that
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.160]   has custodial access of the accounts
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.560]   and just does that for us.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.040]   It's incredibly boring, incredibly boring dimension
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.840]   funds indexing because I don't want to think about it.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.720]   The only other thing I will add is
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.440]   skim a little off of unexpected or extra money
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.880]   to do something fun but that doesn't
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.800]   inflate your lifestyle.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.280]   I'm also a big believer in that.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.640]   I started doing that even when I had no money.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.040]   And then I'd make a little bit of money writing.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.280]   I always had a philosophy of take
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.920]   a sliver of whatever is extra and just do whatever.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.000]   Do whatever.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.880]   As long as it doesn't inflate your lifestyle.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.040]   Don't use it as the down payment on a car
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.120]   that you have to pay really heavy payments on.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.600]   But go on a trip or buy something that's nice.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.880]   Or you want to have some reward or fun with it.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.920]   And that's great.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.120]   You want to feel good about something went well.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.960]   I sold a thing.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.480]   I made some money.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.760]   Take some of that money and go do something fun with it.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.160]   I think that's fine.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.660]   All right.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.860]   So Raj, that's my philosophy.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.760]   Let me summarize this all.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.200]   Fix a lifestyle that's really good that you really enjoy
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.300]   but that you can easily afford with your current financial
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.840]   status.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.760]   And then as you make more, that's great.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.720]   Save that money.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.240]   Don't inflate your lifestyle.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.680]   I do boring stuff with my saving.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.640]   But if you have a chance to invest in yourself,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.600]   that's always the best investment you can make.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.320]   And always take a sliver of things
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.960]   that are unexpected or extra or nice.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.920]   Take a sliver to do something nice for yourself
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.200]   because life is short.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.720]   Or if all that fails, it's all Dogecoin.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.200]   I'm telling you, I have a system.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.080]   I have a system.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.560]   You have to-- you go to Dogecoin because you
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.440]   have to wait till a day of the week of the month
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.660]   that's a prime number, cyclically speaking.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.280]   But actually, what you really want to do
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.400]   is take the days of the week and translate them
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.120]   onto a finite field that you can have a bijection from
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.600]   to the primes.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.040]   And then you want to take a prime of the prime number
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.920]   finite field, invest on that day.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.440]   37 days later, sell.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.480]   This is my system.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.560]   That's the other thing I would say.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.060]   So that will also make you a billionaire in about nine days.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.180]   So you can do that, or you can do what I do,
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.180]   which is try to live reasonably, save what you make extra.
