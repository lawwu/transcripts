[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   The words to which I would like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.740]   found in the epistle to the Romans in chapter 10 verses 18 to 21, verses 18 to
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:19.440]   21 in the 10th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans. But I say, have they not
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.720]   heard? Yes, verily their sound went into all the earth and their words into the
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.520]   ends of the world. But I say, did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.320]   provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.840]   anger you. But Esaias is very bold and saith, I was fond of them that sought me not.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.000]   I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. But to Israel he saith, all
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.880]   day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.360]   Now we come here to the final subsection of this 10th chapter of this
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.520]   epistle to the Romans. We divided it up into these various subsections at the
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.360]   beginning and indicated then, as I've had occasion to do since, that here in these
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:28.200]   last verses the Apostle sums up the whole argument of the entire chapter. And
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.720]   in particular, he sums up and finishes what he's been saying in the immediate
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.360]   previous subsection. So that this is a very important statement. You may
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.760]   remember that we indicated when we began this 10th chapter that we regard it as a
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:58.080]   kind of excursus, almost a digression if you like. The main argument of the
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.000]   Apostle with respect to the Jews would in a sense be quite complete if we went
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.040]   from the end of chapter 9 to the beginning of chapter 11. But as is his
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.280]   custom, he likes to put a case fully and finally, and so he elaborates it. That's
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.760]   our view of this 10th chapter, that it is really an explanation and an exposition
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.160]   of what he had been saying towards the end of the 9th chapter. The main
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.040]   problem, of course, from the beginning of chapter 9 right on until the end of
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.680]   chapter 11, is this peculiar case of the Jews. This astounding fact that our Lord
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.840]   when he came into the world, came unto his own and his own received him not. But
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.360]   there were those who did and those to whom he gave power to become the sons of
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.960]   God, even to them that believe on his name. That's the theme with which the
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.480]   Apostle is dealing and as we've been seeing in this chapter, he has been
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.320]   bringing up with particular clarity the fact that this whole tragedy is due to
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.800]   the fact that they stumbled at this stumbling stone, namely Christ and
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.360]   justification by faith only. And in their folly they went about to
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.000]   establish their own righteousness, though they could never actually do so.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.680]   And so he's been telling us, as you remember, that God's way of
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.560]   salvation has always been the same, and it has been this, "whosoever calleth upon
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.640]   the name of the Lord shall be saved." And then that has led him to say that God
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.080]   has given absolute proof of this, because he has called preachers. God would never
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.320]   have called preachers and sent them forth to preach, unless this was his own
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.520]   ordained way of saving men. So he's dealt with that, as we've seen, in great
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.120]   detail. And then he's raised this question by means of a quotation again
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.640]   from the Prophet Isaiah, "but they have not all obeyed the gospel." Now then, that's
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.720]   the thing which he's finally going to deal with. We've already seen partially the
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.640]   answer to that question, but the Apostle is now going to take it up in detail, and
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.800]   he does so in this most interesting way. He says, "but I say," and you notice he says
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.240]   that twice over, and you'll find again in chapter 11 that he says it again. Now
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.400]   that is a favorite way of conducting an argument by the Apostle Paul, and it is
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.520]   indeed a very good way of arguing always, and it's a very good method for all of
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.920]   us to imply. You put up a rhetorical question and you answer it. It's a very
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.440]   emphatic way of arguing. You put up this query and then you answer it, or put up a
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.480]   case and deal with it. And it is, as I say, a particularly effective one. In other
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   words, what the Apostle, you see, is doing is this. Having argued out God's way of
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.840]   salvation, he's now going to apply it to this particular case of the Jews. And he
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.560]   will go on in chapter 11 to deal with their whole position in a still more
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.400]   thorough manner, so that in a sense we are leaving the great realm of
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.400]   doctrine pure and simple, as it were, and are coming now to his application of it
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.240]   all to the case of the Jews. And he does it in this particular way. Now I don't
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.640]   know whether any of you have been interested in this point as to why the
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.680]   good people who divided up the Scriptures into chapters, why they've
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.960]   divided it up as they did. Some may have wondered why didn't they start a new
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.000]   chapter at the beginning of verse 18. You see, he's finished with his exposition
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.240]   of God's way of salvation through preaching. "Faith cometh by hearing, and
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.640]   hearing by the Word of God." That's how faith comes. It's the result of hearing,
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.680]   and hearing comes by the preaching, and so on. Well now there, you see, in a sense
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.360]   he's finished the doctrine, as I say. Now he comes to application. You would have
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.800]   thought, therefore, that he might, that they might very well have decided to
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.120]   start a new chapter here, instead of later at the beginning of what is our
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.360]   chapter 11. But I think they were quite right, perfectly right, for this reason.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:34.200]   That here, in these four verses, the Apostle is primarily dealing with "but
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.400]   they have not all obeyed the gospel." He wants to finish that off. He's got to
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.680]   finish off that particular point. And it's only after he has finished that,
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.360]   that he then can stand back, as it were, and say, "Well now then, let us look at the
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.840]   whole question of the Jew." So he does that in verse 1 of chapter 11, when he
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:01.520]   says, "I say then, hath God cast away his people?" And on he goes to deal with it
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.920]   in the body of chapter 11. So I believe the division into chapters, in this
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:13.280]   particular case, is more than justified. I'm assuming that you all realize that
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.600]   the division into verses and chapters has been done by men. In the original, you
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.080]   don't have this division at all. And let's remember, therefore, that the
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.240]   divisions are not divinely inspired. The words and the matter are divinely
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.000]   inspired, but the divisions into verses and chapters are not. And we are as
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.800]   competent to decide where to divide as the people who did it
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.040]   originally. But it is a matter of interest to notice how their minds
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.880]   worked, and how, I believe here, very rightly, they have realized that the
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.880]   major division comes where they have put it, at the beginning of chapter 11. Very
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:02.040]   well. Now then, the Apostle wants to take up this particular point, and he takes it
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.440]   in this most excellent way. And as we follow him and what he says, we shall see
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:18.080]   that he really here brings a tremendous, irrefutable indictment against the Jews.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.320]   He shows that their case is completely indefensible, and that their whole
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:33.200]   conduct with respect to the gospel is entirely inexcusable. The Apostle Paul
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.720]   was a mighty arguer, and debater, and reasoner. And nowhere does he show the
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:46.040]   brilliance of his debating powers more than he does at this particular point.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.560]   But let's remember, his ultimate object is not merely to indict the Jews, and to
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:57.160]   show how terribly wrong they were. Don't forget the first verse, "Brethren, my
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.280]   heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved."
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.480]   That's his object. He's not setting out to win an argument. He's not simply setting
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.640]   out to show that he is right. What he really is concerned to do is to show
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:18.120]   them how tragically wrong they are, hoping that if they see it, they will
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.440]   repent and acknowledge it and turn to the Lord. His heart's desire and prayer
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:31.400]   to God for Israel is that they might be saved. I emphasize that because you and
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.960]   I should be animated by the same desire. It's not always easy to keep these two
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.640]   things going together. But that is what we are called to do as preachers, and as
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.400]   teachers, and as anybody who's an apologist for the Christian faith, when
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.680]   you're dealing with an individual. You've got to show that he's wrong, and that
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.800]   this is the truth, and that you are right. But sometimes it's very difficult to do
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:03.760]   that in love, to speak the truth in love. Sometimes, unconsciously, we cross that
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.080]   very delicate line, and we become more concerned in proving that we are right,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:14.840]   even than we are in saving that man's soul. But let's remember that a man who
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:21.280]   was convinced against his will is of the same opinion still. We mustn't browbeat,
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.920]   and the apostle never does that. The argument is tremendous, but it is still
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.520]   an argument conducted in love, and with a desire to show them their wrongness, in
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.920]   order that, having their eyes open, they will vacate that position, and submit
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.360]   themselves with a willing obedience to the gospel of our Lord and Savior, Jesus
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.280]   Christ. Let us then, my friends, be imitators of the great apostle, in this
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.100]   matter as in every other matter, and then we shan't go very far wrong. Well, now
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.760]   then, what's his argument? Well, here's the argument. "Faith cometh by hearing, and
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:06.680]   hearing by the Word of God." All right. But they have not all obeyed the gospel.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:13.080]   That's the question. Now, there's a great discussion going on amongst the
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.920]   commentators. I mean by that that when you, not those who are alive only, but
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.400]   those who are now no longer in this world, the commentators argue amongst
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.520]   themselves, as they're very fond of doing, over this question, "To whom is he
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:33.920]   referring here?" Some say that he's referring to the Jews only, others say he's
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.840]   referring to the Gentiles only. Calvin, for instance, doesn't hesitate to say
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:45.480]   that in verse 18, he is referring to the Gentiles only. And as I said, there are
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.440]   others who say it's the Jews only. Well, my opinion on this matter, for what it's
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.800]   worth, is this, that I disagree with both parties, because I think he's referring
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.920]   to Jews and Gentiles. He's referring to all who have not obeyed the gospel. He's
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.060]   been establishing the point that it's preached to all. Well, then he says it is
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.520]   clear that some believe and some don't believe, some obey, some don't obey. Now
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.840]   then, the whole question is, why is it that people don't obey in this way? It's
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.360]   true of any who don't obey the gospel. But if I were pressed to say one more
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.320]   than another, I would say that he is referring essentially to the Jews,
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:33.720]   because the whole chapter is primarily concerned with the case of the Jews. And
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:41.800]   therefore the position is, they have not all obeyed the gospel. Why is that? Now,
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.680]   what the Apostle does in these four verses is to answer that particular
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.400]   question. And he puts it, as I say, in this interesting way of putting up a
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:58.320]   rhetorical question and then dealing with it. Now, the Apostle here, I want to try
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:07.560]   to show you, really says four things. He deals with the negative reasons and he
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   deals with positive reasons. Why is it that the majority of the Jews have not
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:21.900]   believed the gospel? Now then, let's take the negative first. Now here, under the
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:30.920]   negative, he has two things to say. And he puts them himself as negatives, that's
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:39.200]   why I'm adopting this classification. So the first thing he says is this, it is
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.440]   not through lack of hearing that they don't believe. Not through lack of
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.680]   hearing. I say, have they not heard? Somebody may say they don't believe
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.920]   because they haven't heard the gospel. You don't condemn a man for not believing
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.720]   something that he hasn't heard. Ah, that may be the explanation, that they haven't
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.120]   heard the gospel. Now the Apostle puts it in the form of a negative, a double
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.080]   negative. It really reads like this, not that they did not hear, not that they did
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:13.960]   not hear, query. Is it that? And you see, by putting it in his double negative, he's
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:21.160]   implying a negative answer. Not that they did not hear, certainly not. Why
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.160]   certainly not? Well, verily their sound went into all the earth and their words
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:32.800]   into the ends of the world. It cannot be said, says the Apostle, that they do not
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.560]   believe the gospel because they haven't heard the gospel. Because the gospel has
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:44.160]   been preached everywhere. And he puts that in this very interesting way by a
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:52.680]   quotation, which he takes from the 19th Psalm. And you remember, "The heavens
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day, and
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.560]   today uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. There is no
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.800]   speech nor language where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.640]   all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.560]   tabernacle for the sun, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.560]   rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. His going forth is from the end of the
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.880]   heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.360]   heat thereof." Now, the Apostle appropriates that English, and uses it to make the
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.160]   point that the gospel is preached everywhere. Now, what the psalmist was
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:44.040]   saying was this, that the knowledge of God is universal, because the heavens are
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:50.240]   universal. The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament and the sun.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.320]   Wherever there is the heavens, and wherever there is the sun, there is
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:01.360]   preaching concerning the being of God. That's what the psalmist is saying.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:08.720]   Everything declares the being and the glory of God, so that there is no spot in
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.760]   the whole universe that isn't having a message, as it were, concerning the
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:21.240]   being and the glory of God. Now, this is something that is stated quite often in
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.800]   the Scriptures. You remember that the Apostle Paul and Barnabas really said
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.720]   the same thing in preaching to those pagan people in Lystra, those people who
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   are about to worship them. But Paul says in Acts 14 15, "Sirs, why do ye these
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.920]   things? We also are men of like passions with you, and
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.120]   preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the living God,
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.960]   which made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein, who in
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.760]   times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless, he left
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.880]   not himself without witness, in that he did good and gave us rain from
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:05.640]   heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness." Say, my
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:15.400]   dear, the whole world is inexcusable in its ignorance of God, because God, by rain
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:21.120]   and sun and fruitful seasons, is giving evidence, he's preaching about himself.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.120]   And it's very important that you and I should always bear that in mind. And you
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.680]   remember how in the first chapter of this great epistle to the Romans, the
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.640]   Apostle has been arguing the same thing, where he says in verse 20, or verse 19
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.080]   and 20, "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.200]   showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.760]   world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:58.160]   eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse." Now, the world is
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.880]   without an excuse for its ignorance of God, because the whole of creation is
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.760]   declaring him, is preaching him. Their sound and their words are everywhere. The
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.840]   heavens declare the glory of God, so that they are without excuse. In exactly the
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:21.200]   same way, says the Apostle, these unbelievers are without excuse, because
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   the gospel has been preached everywhere. In the same way, their sound, as it were,
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   went into all the earth, and their words unto the end, ends of the world. Now, that
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:45.380]   is something that one often does. Often in preaching, one finds oneself doing the
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.400]   very thing the Apostle does here. You will often find that what you were
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.300]   trying to say, or what you want to say, can be best of all said by a quotation
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.680]   from the scripture. Though it isn't perhaps dealing with precisely the point
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.560]   that you are dealing with, the same general statement applies to it. And as
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.400]   there the psalmist was saying, that this knowledge of God the Creator is
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:13.220]   universal, he's saying here, the knowledge of the gospel is universal. But
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.940]   somebody probably wants to query this, and say, "Can you say like that, that the
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:26.740]   gospel of Jesus Christ really has been preached everywhere, and universally to
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:32.340]   all people?" Well, let the Apostle Paul answer your question. This is how we find
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.660]   him writing in the first chapter of the epistle to the Colossians, in chapter 6.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.980]   He's writing to these, and thanking God for them, for the hope which is laid up
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:47.020]   for you in heaven, which you, whereof you heard before, in the word of the truth of
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:55.420]   the gospel, which is come unto you as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.300]   fruit as it does also in you since the day you heard it, and knew the grace of
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.380]   God in truth. He says there to the Colossians that this truth of the gospel
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:13.500]   has come to them as it has indeed in all the world. He repeats that in the 23rd
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:19.680]   verse of that first chapter of Colossians. He says that if you continue
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:25.300]   in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:30.780]   gospel which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:38.940]   under heaven. Now then, this is where the pedants get into trouble, isn't it? This
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.580]   offence of the Apostle saying that the gospel has been preached to every
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:47.700]   creature which is under heaven. Is it true to say that every single man on
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.340]   earth everywhere has heard the preaching of this gospel, or have done so in the
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:58.540]   time of the Apostle Paul? Well the answer is of course no. What does the Apostle
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.700]   mean then? Well, you see, this is what is called hyperbole, if you
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:09.180]   like. It's just a way of saying that the gospel has been disseminated generally.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:17.220]   It doesn't mean every single individual. It means that the gospel is not something
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.220]   that has been hidden. Or let me use the words that the Apostle himself used when
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:28.740]   he was addressing that distinguished company, remember, with the King Agrippa
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:34.180]   and his consort and Festus and his wife. The Apostle preaching to them and
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:39.180]   bringing out the fact said to them, "These things were not done in a corner." He
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:44.900]   means by that that they were known. And here he is just bringing out this fact
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.500]   that no man can say that he hasn't heard this because the gospel is preached
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.340]   everywhere. You remember how our Lord himself, in giving his commission to the
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.620]   disciples after his resurrection and immediately before the Ascension, he says,
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:04.700]   "Tarry ye in Jerusalem until, but you shall receive power after that the Holy
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.860]   Ghost is come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:15.820]   in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth. You shall be,"
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.020]   he says to these. Well now, that's another way of saying the same thing
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:25.460]   exactly, that the gospel is to be preached everywhere, throughout the whole world.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:31.060]   And he's simply saying that here in a slightly different manner. You'll find
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.340]   that kind of expression quite commonly in the Scriptures. And you mustn't come
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.700]   with your pedantic mind and say, "Does this mean that every single individual?"
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:44.700]   Of course it doesn't. The point he's establishing is that the gospel is
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:50.260]   disseminated in this wide manner. We've already dealt with the case earlier on, a
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.900]   few months back, of those who never actually have heard the gospel at all,
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.180]   and their responsibility with respect to it, and whether they can be saved or not.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.580]   We've already dealt with that. Here the apostle is simply saying that the gospel
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.860]   has been preached widely and generally, and the Jews of all people have no right
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.380]   to say that they haven't heard it, and that they don't believe it for the
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:18.100]   reason that they haven't heard it. Well now, the gospel, of course, as the
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:22.980]   apostle says, had been preached everywhere. Our Lord's prophecy was
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.940]   fulfilled at Pentecost. There were people up in Jerusalem then, from most parts of
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:32.340]   the then known and civilized world, and they had that opportunity, and they went
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:37.940]   back, and it was spread through them, and likewise through other preachers, as I'm
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:43.660]   going to show you. Well now, this is the most important statement. The apostle
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:48.420]   says the Jews can't get out of it by saying that they haven't heard.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:54.460]   I say, have they not heard? The thing's ridiculous, he says. The thing has gone
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:24:00.420]   everywhere. The sound has spread throughout, went into all the earth,
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:07.140]   and their words unto the ends of the world. Well now, in what sense is it right
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:15.900]   for him to say this? How does he rarely prove, then, that the Jews cannot plead
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:22.980]   ignorance with respect to the general statement of the gospel? Well, this is a
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.980]   very profound argument of his, and this, you see, is where he brings it right home
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:33.620]   to them. And he does it in this way. Let us start with the way in which our Lord
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:39.540]   himself does it. Take what our Lord says in the fifth chapter of the gospel
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.420]   according to St. John. You see, our Lord rarely had to face the same position. All
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:50.920]   that argumentation between our Lord and the Pharisees and scribes was virtually
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.540]   what Paul is arguing in this tenth chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:04.100]   It's the same argument exactly. Listen to this, John 5, 39. "Search the Scriptures," or
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:10.620]   if you like, the other translation, "You do search the Scriptures, for in them you
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:20.700]   think that you have eternal life, and they are they which testify of me." He says, "You
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:25.260]   are saying that I'm preaching some novelty, and that you believe the
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:30.020]   Scriptures." "Very well," he says, "read your Scriptures. And if you read your
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.500]   Scriptures properly, you will find that they are the very statements which tell
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:42.340]   of me." Then listen again, verses 45 to 47. "Do not think that I will accuse you to
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:54.180]   the Father, for there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom he trusts. For had
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:00.780]   ye believed Moses, you would have believed me, for he wrote on me." You see,
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.980]   they'd heard the gospel through Moses. Their own Scriptures they were so proud
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:10.420]   of. They were the very ones that were preaching of him. "Moses preached of me."
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.700]   "Go to your Moses," then he says, "if you believe not his
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:22.580]   writings, how shall ye believe my words?" Now this is a tremendous statement which
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:27.820]   we often tend to lose sight of. I'm hoping, before we finish this session, to
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.660]   take up this point again and deal with it in a more general manner. But there is
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.900]   enough if we had nothing else. That's exactly the argument of Paul in Romans 10.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:42.540]   They have heard it. They've been hearing it from Moses. They've been hearing it
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.700]   from the Scriptures. Or take again how our Lord makes precisely the same point
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:52.940]   after his resurrection in what we read about his encounter with the two men on
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:59.100]   the road to Emmaus in the last chapter of Luke's gospel. After these two men had
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:03.420]   finished their harangue and all they'd got to say, and gave our Lord an
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:09.060]   opportunity of saying anything, this is what he said to them. "Oh fools and slow
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:15.060]   of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken. Ought not Christ to
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.900]   have suffered these things and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:25.140]   and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.700]   concerning himself." Now all the Scriptures, you see, doesn't mean every
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.580]   single verse in the Old Testament, but it means every part of the Old Testament.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:39.420]   Christ is there everywhere in the Old Testament. That's what he's saying. Now
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.820]   it's exactly the same argument, you see. And of course we have it later on again
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:49.180]   in the 24th chapter of the gospel according to St. Luke, verse 44. He said
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.300]   unto them, "These are the words which I speak unto you while I was yet with you,
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:59.140]   that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:06.780]   the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me." The Jews have no right to
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.700]   say that they haven't heard. They've been hearing it even through the Old
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:19.620]   Testament Scriptures and the teaching of those Scriptures. And there it is, as our
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:25.620]   Lord says, it's in the books of Moses, it's in the Psalms, it's in the prophets.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:32.980]   Isaiah 53 and all similar statements. And then you see the Apostle Paul, in his
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:38.820]   way, puts exactly this same point in writing to Timothy in the second epistle
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:45.180]   in the third chapter and verses 15 and 16. Here it is, he is reminding, "Continue
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.300]   though, he says, in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of,
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:54.620]   knowing of whom thou hast learned them, and that from a child," before his
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:29:01.220]   conversion, "from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:08.540]   make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus." You can
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:14.820]   preach the gospel from the Old Testament. They are able to make us wise unto
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:19.260]   salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. The Old Testament, that's
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.220]   what he means by the Scriptures. And if you and I don't see Christ and his
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:29.220]   salvation in the Old Testament, it's because we are blind, my friends. There are
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.380]   certain foolish Christian people who seem to think we don't need the Old
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.260]   Testament. What a terrible ignorance that is, and how unscriptural in any case. What
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:42.900]   a contradiction of the plain teaching of the New Testament. Yes, Christ is there.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:48.580]   The salvation is all there. If you've got enlightened eyes, you'll find it there,
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:53.420]   and you'll find it there in most glorious terms, quite frequently. Very
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.740]   well, then, Paul is arguing that they mustn't say that they haven't heard it,
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:02.580]   and they of everybody who rejoiced in the Scriptures. The Scriptures have been
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:09.100]   preaching this very thing to them that they are now rejecting. Then, of course,
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:14.220]   when you leave the Old Testament, you come over into the New. You have the
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:20.540]   phenomenon of John the Baptist, and all the Jews knew about him. John was a
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:26.300]   veritable phenomenon. These extraordinary men who began to preach there in the
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.500]   wilderness, these strange men who didn't dress like anybody else and didn't eat
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:35.820]   the same food, leather and girdle about his loins, lived on locusts and wild
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:42.700]   honey, and this fiery prophetic preaching. This Elijah, as it were, come to life
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.900]   again, and they crowded out to hear him. He was a phenomenon, and all the Jews
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.220]   knew about him. The thing was noised abroad throughout the whole land of
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:57.260]   Palestine, and what was he preaching about? And what he said was this, "I am not
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:03.060]   the Christ. There cometh one after me, mightier than I, the lachet of whose
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:11.060]   shoes I am unworthy to unloose. I indeed baptize you with water. He shall baptize
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:16.060]   you with the Holy Ghost and with fire, whose fan is in his hand, and he will
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.580]   throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:25.460]   will burn with fire unquenchable. The forerunner, behold the Lamb of God that
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:31.820]   taketh away the sin of the world." That was his message. "He must increase, I must
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:37.060]   decrease." There he is, he said, pointing to him, and the Jews said that they
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.820]   hadn't heard. Trying to defend themselves by saying that they hadn't heard the
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.820]   gospel, and yet John the Baptist alone is enough to silence them and to answer them
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:52.140]   once and forever. The forerunner points to the Messiah. He preaches the Messiah.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:57.780]   They'd heard through John the Baptist, who disclaims that he is the Messiah
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:02.660]   himself, but points to this other. Well, there it is. You see, the evidence is
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:11.700]   piling up. And then, of course, our Lord himself, the supreme phenomenon. This
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:17.460]   young man, this apparent carpenter from Nazareth, who begins to preach at the
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:23.180]   age of 30, and who impresses the people at once, this man speaketh with authority,
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:31.340]   and not as the Pharisees and scribes. His understanding, the profundity of his
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:35.580]   teaching. You have heard that it was said by them of all time, "I say unto you." This
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:40.500]   authority, and this profound depth of knowledge and understanding, his
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:46.060]   exposition of the law in the Sermon on the Mount, all this. Now, the whole of the
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:51.980]   land of Palestine knew this. It was talked about everywhere, and emphasized
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:58.580]   by the opposition of the Pharisees and scribes, and then his miracles. As he said
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.860]   himself one day, "Though you believe not my works, my words believe for the very
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:11.660]   works' sake." Look at the works. He pointed them to the signs. These are
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:17.540]   preaching. Now, all this historical truth is of such tremendous importance in this
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:24.220]   matter. It is the final convicting of the Jews of their utter inexcusability. They
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.180]   mustn't say they haven't heard. They couldn't help hearing. It was impossible for them,
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:35.420]   not to have heard. And then, of course, beyond the teaching of the miracles, his
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:41.300]   death upon the cross, and still more amazing, his resurrection. They hadn't
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.900]   seen that, but they'd heard about it. This was the preaching of the early disciples.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.700]   This was the reason why they persecuted these apostles and disciples, because
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.020]   they preached Jesus and the resurrection, and they saw the change in these men.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.580]   In other words, you've got this tremendous phenomenon of Pentecost. It
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:04.260]   was impossible for anybody to be a Jew and not to hear about Pentecost. It was
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.020]   such an astounding phenomenon. The people came crowding together everywhere.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:13.660]   Everybody knew about this. Well, what is this? This is preaching concerning him.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:18.580]   And as I say, these delegates would come up from various parts of the civilized
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:23.060]   world to the feast of Pentecost. They saw it, and they heard the preaching of Peter,
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:29.460]   and they went back. This is the way in which the whole position of the Jew is
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:36.460]   entirely demolished. And then, after that, you have, of course, the preaching of the
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:42.660]   apostles themselves, and how they traveled abroad like these men, the apostle Paul,
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:47.820]   crossing oceans, crossing continents, going everywhere. And the others, the same,
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:52.820]   preaching, propagating, making this message known. And of course, secular
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.540]   history even testifies to this, that the report sent by the proponsel back to the
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:03.780]   emperor in Rome makes note of this. It was a most amazing phenomenon in the world at
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.060]   that time. There was nothing that was more spoken of than this very thing. This is
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:12.980]   the way in which the apostle therefore establishes that it mustn't be said that
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:17.700]   they haven't heard, because it's gone everywhere. Like the sun preaches, so this
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:23.460]   message has gone abroad everywhere, and not only the apostles. You have those
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:29.900]   other preachers, such as Stephen, and the various evangelists who were sent on
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.180]   journeys, and sent out to preach, and to propagate the message. And not only that,
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.600]   the devil even helped, because there was a persecution in Jerusalem, and the
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.500]   people were all scattered abroad. And what we are told about them in Acts 8,
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:49.180]   4, is that they went everywhere and preached the word. They made it known.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.900]   They told people why they were persecuted, why they were having to leave
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:57.460]   Jerusalem, why they've been evacuated, as it were. And it was all because of this
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:02.220]   message. Their word literally went everywhere. The message was carried
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:10.020]   abroad, and to all portions of the then known and civilized world. In other words,
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:17.700]   the apostle is making this point, that the Christian gospel is not some secret
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:24.380]   message. It's not like those so-called mystery religions that were so common in
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:29.580]   that ancient world. It wasn't an esoteric message. You know, these mystery
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.660]   religions, they didn't preach their gospel from the housetops. They didn't
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:40.420]   make it known to everybody. No, no, you had to be initiated. It was a secret
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:46.580]   message. There are organizations and societies that still do that sort of
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.100]   thing. We don't know what they believe exactly, because we haven't been
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:54.460]   initiated. We don't belong to them. You're not told the message until you go in.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:59.180]   It's secret. It isn't propagated to the whole world. Now, the apostle's point is
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.900]   that the gospel is the exact opposite of that. Not some hidden, secret, esoteric
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:10.500]   message. But it is something that, at the command of God himself and the Lord
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:16.820]   Jesus Christ, through the called, appointed, sent preachers, is to be heard
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:24.060]   by everybody, everywhere. Very well then. There, the apostle, you see, has dealt with
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:31.700]   what I call his first negative argument. The explanation of the Jews and their
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:36.060]   rejection is not that they haven't heard. They haven't a leg to stand on on that
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:43.940]   score, because the gospel has been spread abroad in this amazing manner. Well then,
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.780]   their second, the second negative—I'm only going to mention it to you tonight
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:52.420]   because we haven't got time, obviously, to work it out—the second negative is
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:38:00.940]   that their trouble was not due to lack of plain teaching concerning the gospel.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:06.980]   You see how the one follows from the other. All right, let's grant that this
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:11.860]   message has gone abroad, but is the message quite plain and clear about all
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.660]   this? And the apostle says that it is. He puts that again in the form of this
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:25.020]   negative rhetorical question. I say, did not Israel know then? Didn't Israel know?
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:31.900]   Again, it is one of these double negatives. Did Israel not fail to know?
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:38.620]   The answer is, no, they are quite inexcusable. What does he mean here? Well,
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:50.060]   what he's saying here, you see, is this, that the gospel is not an innovation. The
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:54.020]   apostle and the other apostles were being charged with teaching some new
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:59.420]   teaching. The Jews, standing as they thought upon their scriptures, said, "But
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:03.060]   look here, you say you believe in the same God and that you haven't turned
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.700]   your back on the God of your fathers and that you're not denying our scriptures.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:11.380]   You say that, but your message is a blank denial of them. It's got nothing to do
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:15.740]   with them. It's absolutely new. It's a new teaching." The apostle says, "It's not.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:22.500]   It's not an innovation," which cuts right across everything that the Jews had known
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:30.260]   in the past. How can he prove this? Well, this is what he sets out to show, that in
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:36.380]   the scriptures, again, of the Old Testament, certain things were made
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:43.340]   perfectly plain and clear. What are they? One, the way of salvation. Two, that the
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:49.380]   Gentiles were to be included. Three, that the majority of the Jews would reject
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:54.540]   the gospel. All that has been made perfectly plain in the Old Testament, so
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:58.620]   that they can't say that they didn't know. It's been put perfectly plainly,
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:05.380]   clearly, and explicitly to them. Indeed, by their rejection of the gospel, they
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.960]   are fulfilling the scriptures. They're verifying the prophecies of the prophets.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:18.980]   It is the scriptures in which the Jews so much delighted that convinced them
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:27.860]   and convicted them of blindness and of sin. Now, that is the general statement in
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:32.180]   connection with this second negative argument. And he's going to put it in
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:39.620]   terms of Moses and of Isaiah. Why do you think he selects those two? Well, because,
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:45.180]   as I've already shown you in quotations from Luke 24, it was customary to divide
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:51.440]   the Old Testament into Moses and the prophets. So, you have a quotation from
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:59.340]   Moses, you have a quotation from the major prophet, which is Isaiah. The first
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:04.780]   in their book, and the major one, the evangelical prophet. So, Moses and the
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:10.300]   prophets, both of them, condemned them utterly and completely. They had no right
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:14.860]   to be ignorant. They had no right not to understand the nature of the way of
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.180]   salvation has been made clear, the calling of the Gentiles has been made
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:24.900]   clear, the rejection of the Jews has been made clear. Very well. God willing, we'll
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.860]   proceed to work out the argument as the Apostle puts it before us in his
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:34.140]   quotations next Friday night. Well, now, there you see, in essence, the
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:38.980]   negative part of the argument. And having dealt with that, we shall go on to the
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:48.220]   positive. Let us pray. O Lord, our God, we again come unto thee, and we come, O Lord,
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:55.340]   with fear and trembling, as looking at the folly of others. We know that we are
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:42:00.380]   but in the flesh, and we remember the exhortation which comes to us, saying, "Let
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:07.940]   him that thinketh, he standeth; take heed, lest he fall." O God, we see what frail and
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:13.180]   fallible creatures we are, and we recognize more than ever that we were
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:19.480]   not only saved originally by thy grace, but that it is by grace we stand. And we
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:27.400]   know that nothing but thy grace can keep us and hold us and maintain us until we
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.420]   arrive in the glory. We therefore do again, O Lord, ascribe unto thee all
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:40.260]   praise and honor and glory. Thine they are, and thine alone, and we gladly
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:47.020]   ascribe them unto thee. And now, may the grace of our Lord and Savior, Jesus
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:52.020]   Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:58.460]   Spirit, abide and continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder of
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:06.580]   this hour's short and sudden earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore. Amen.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:10.660]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
