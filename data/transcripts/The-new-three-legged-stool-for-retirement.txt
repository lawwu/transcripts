[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from Financial Samurai. And in this episode, we're going to talk about
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.560]   the new three-legged stool for retirement. The old three-legged stool for retirement
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:18.320]   includes pension, social security, and personal savings. So given less than 15% of Americans have
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.320]   pensions or will receive pensions, no longer is having a pension part of most Americans'
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.600]   retirement plan. Therefore, we can throw pensions out of the window for future generations.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.280]   And for those of you with a pension, bless you, because your pension is probably more
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.640]   valuable than you realize. Given our social security system is underfunded by about 32%,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.280]   the government will either cut the average social security benefit by 32%
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.000]   or raise the minimum age eligible for collecting social security by at least several years.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.400]   As a result, relying on a government that has perpetually mismanaged our finances
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.800]   is not a wise retirement strategy either. Besides, the average monthly social security benefit for
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   62-70 year olds is only $1,000 to $1,300, so you're not going to go crazy with social security anyway.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.600]   Personal savings is the only leg of the old three-legged stool that's able to provide support.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.920]   Everybody who has the opportunity to contribute to a 401(k) plan should, and according to the
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.920]   Bureau of Labor Statistics, only about 55% of the American workforce has access to a 401(k)
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.280]   and only about 38% of the total workforce participates. So these are kind of sad numbers.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.400]   Meanwhile, for those who do participate, the average 401(k) contribution was only about 6.5%
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.280]   of salary when employers didn't contribute and still only 11% of salary when employers did
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.840]   contribute. Only 18% of 401(k) participants saved more than 10% of their salary for retirement.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:04.240]   So for 2019, it's good to hear that the IRS has increased the maximum employee contribution to
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.080]   $19,000, that's up $500 from $18,500 in 2018. Meanwhile, the maximum employer contribution
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.360]   limit also rises by $500 to $37,000 for a total 401(k) contribution limit of $56,000.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.000]   So this is really important to note, folks. Do not underestimate the power of working for a stable
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.600]   and highly profitable employer with a strong benefits program. 401(k) matching or profit
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.040]   sharing can significantly boost your retirement funds over time compared to working at a sexy
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.560]   startup that might not even have a 401(k) plan due to a lack of profitability. And really,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.520]   a lot of startups are just dead in the water or they just fail after 5 years, which really puts
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.880]   you behind, especially since they already pay you under market value in terms of salary for the
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.080]   hopes that your equity options will be worth something in the future. When I left my day job
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.360]   in 2012, I forewent roughly $20,000 a year in profit sharing. So I was an executive director
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.080]   at the time, I'd been there for 11 years, and I was contributing $16,500 as an employee, which was
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.920]   the maximum at the time in 2012, and then they would give me another $20,000 at year end, and
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.880]   that was really sweet. But even though I forewent all that money, at least I got them to pay for my
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.600]   MBA at the time, which cost about, I think around $80,000, and they gave me a severance, which I
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:39.680]   can't complain about. So now I contribute as much as possible to a solo 401(k), a SEP IRA, and of
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.040]   course my son's 529 plan to the tune of about $15,000 a year. Given times have now changed,
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.920]   and we cannot rely on pensions and the government for social security, I would like to propose the
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.720]   new definition of a three-legged retirement stool. Essentially, it's composed of three things. You,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.240]   you, and you. So the first you is personal pre-tax savings, in other words 401(k),
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.000]   IRA, and so forth. The second you is personal after-tax savings, which compose of your after-tax
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.880]   brokerage account, CD, money markets, bonds, fixed income, private equity, venture debt, and so forth.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.320]   And the third you is composed of personal hustle. So everybody should figure out a way to contribute
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.680]   the maximum to their 401(k) savings each year, even without a company match. Your goal is to
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.160]   minimize your taxable income, allow your investments to compound, tax deferred for as long as possible,
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.760]   and then build a large enough after-tax portfolio to give yourself options to change jobs,
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.640]   take a break, be a stay-at-home parent, or retire before the age of 59 and a half. And in the post,
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.240]   I do highlight again my after-tax investment amounts by age to comfortably retire early
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   to give you some idea of how much you should have in your pre-tax accounts and after-tax accounts
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.600]   at every single stage of your life. So clearly, in order to build this type of wealth, it will
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.560]   take a tremendous amount of discipline. You can't just go blow your money on stupid things you don't
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.400]   need. You need to continuously reinvest the large majority of your savings into risk-appropriate
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.120]   investments. And yes, you do need to take risks, folks. The people who are saying, "Wow,
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.040]   I don't understand how people have so much money in their investments and all that."
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.360]   These folks don't take risks. It takes guts to come up with a 20% down payment to buy a property
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.680]   and to maintain it and all that stuff. It takes guts to invest in the market sometimes,
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.520]   especially if it's cratering. The key also is to delay your gratification. That is the key to so
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.400]   many things to being in good shape, to building wealth over time. It's delaying gratification.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.080]   So the third leg of the new retirement stool is earning money doing something you enjoy.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.760]   This is your personal hustle. So one of the most dangerous things about post-work life is letting
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.400]   your mind and body atrophy. This is one of the reasons why I let my dad edit most of my posts.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.920]   It keeps him on his toes. It keeps him sharp. He's 72 years old and he actually has said,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.000]   "I appreciate you letting me edit the post." He's a pretty brutal editor and he changes a lot of my
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.400]   meanings. It's tough sometimes to see it as a creator, but I think it's for the greater good
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.000]   and he does catch some things and it helps his mind. So the more you can stay active post-traditional
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.880]   work, the better your retirement lifestyle. I truly believe this. So in my case, I stay active
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.080]   in post-work life by one, being a stay-at-home dad. It's a full-time job that any stay-at-home
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.680]   parent will realize how hard it really is. Two, I coach high school tennis for three to four months
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.800]   a year. And then three, I write daily on Financial Samurai and sometimes I do this podcast. So all
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.400]   three activities have a monetary component that enables me to better preserve my retirement nest
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   egg. What you'll discover after leaving full-time work is that it becomes extremely difficult to
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:21.280]   spend down principal. You've spent years, if not decades, accumulating your wealth. So it's really
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:28.400]   hard to go in reverse. Being a stay-at-home parent, both of us, allows us to save about $3,000 a month
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.560]   in childcare costs. Coaching high school tennis brings in about $1,250 a month and allows me to
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   build relationships with other members of the community. And there are some really interesting
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.000]   parents who are doing interesting things, such as one parent who is the CFO of Lyft and Lyft is
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.520]   going to go public in 2019. I think that's pretty cool. Another parent is a district attorney of San
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.920]   Francisco. So these are all really interesting people to meet and we get to talk and hang out
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.760]   and it's really fun. And then finally, while riding daily on Financial Samurai, it does keep
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.960]   my mind sharp, it also brings in some spare change to boot, right, through advertising, revenue,
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.800]   just random opportunities and so forth. So one of America's biggest retirement failures
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.280]   is allowing people to decide how much they should save for retirement. If you were to give people a
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.520]   choice between spending money on cheeseburgers, nice cars, fancy clothes, shoes, vacations,
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   electronics, and more cheeseburgers, or saving for a retirement that is decades away, obviously,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.400]   obviously the majority of Americans are going to choose the former. Thus, it is unsurprising that
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.840]   roughly 66 of Americans are overweight, and the median retirement savings for all families is less
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.320]   than $10,000. It was $5,000 as of 2013. So I'm assuming it's gotten better since the bull market
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:56.400]   has run quite well since 2013. But even if it's $10,000, that's just not enough. Our lack of
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.000]   discipline is literally ruining our lives. I mean, do you really want to be overweight and kind of
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.760]   broke in your latter part of your life? No, it's just like terrible. There's like some statistic
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.520]   that says that 80 plus percent of men in America over 50 are overweight or obese. I mean, that's
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:21.280]   not good, folks. We got to like, really take back that discipline. We should have adopted a forced
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.840]   retirement savings system when companies automatically deduct money from each employee's
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.280]   paycheck for retirement, much like how payroll taxes are automatically deducted. You know,
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.720]   the government knows that if they don't take money out of your paycheck for taxes, people
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.160]   aren't going to pay their taxes, right? I think it's pretty obvious because we lack self-discipline.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.720]   You know, this forced retirement savings system, it's worked in countries like Australia and
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.520]   Singapore. You know, Australia has the largest inheritance amounts in the country because
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.920]   they're forced savings and they're buying property and they've got these great savings,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.360]   retirement savings accounts. But unfortunately, it's already too late for change, right? We're
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.520]   just, I think, kind of in this situation through our own demise. Therefore, the only thing we can
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:16.080]   really do is count on ourselves. If we can depend on our own hustle to survive in retirement,
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.800]   all other government benefits will simply be a nice bonus. I'm going to be pretty psyched if I
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.120]   start getting, let's say, $2,000 a month in Social Security, let's say, after the age of 65. I'm
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.920]   going to use that, I don't know, probably to go on a cruise, travel, eat some food. But I'm
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:40.240]   definitely not counting on that to spend in retirement. You know, I want to get my own
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.480]   finances right and so should you. Don't rely on anybody else but yourself. So please spread the
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.200]   word about the new three-legged retirement stool. I think it's going to be great for our country.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   Let's focus on building our you number one with personal pre-tax savings, our you number two with
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.720]   personal after-tax savings, and our you number three with personal hustle. I think if we do that,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.640]   America is going to be a stronger country and we're going to do much greater things going forward
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:14.880]   and live a much better second half of our life. Thanks so much everyone. It's been a really,
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.560]   really fun week. I went public with the launch of the Financial Samurai Forums, so hopefully I can
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:27.200]   see you guys there interacting. There's over 1,150 members now and it's just great to see people
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.360]   interacting and sharing their ideas and thoughts. My parents were here for about a week and it's
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.480]   been great for them to see and spend time with our son and that's really all I really want
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.800]   because they're in Hawaii and I'd love for them to visit more often.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.440]   So thanks so much everyone and I'll see you guys around.
