[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.820]   Welcome to the Everyday Educator, where we explore what it means to learn alongside your
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.420]   family every day.
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.280]   We want to encourage one another as we ponder the delights and challenges that make homeschooling
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.720]   the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.580]   Whether you are new to this homeschool adventure or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.080]   we are glad you found us.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.240]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome, you'll find even closer support
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.740]   in a local CC community.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:48.280]   So go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you today.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.180]   Well, guys, I'm Lisa.
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.100]   I'm Lisa Bailey.
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.420]   I'm your host for today.
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.300]   And I'm super glad to welcome you to this episode of the Everyday Educator.
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.840]   And even more glad to welcome my guest, Isaiah Wentz.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.200]   Isaiah, great to have you today.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.300]   Hi, Lisa.
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.460]   It's so great to be on here.
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.380]   Thank you for having me.
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.200]   I am excited to hear what you have to say to our listeners.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.260]   Okay, guys.
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.340]   Isaiah is the kid you've always wanted to bend the ear of.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.780]   He is going to be able to give you some words of wisdom for yourselves as parents and for
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.620]   your students.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.420]   Isaiah is going to share with us today some words of wisdom for those Challenge A and B
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.980]   students who are probably near and dear to your heart.
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.360]   Isaiah, tell us a little bit about your homeschooling experience.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.100]   What if I said, here's the beginning of the story.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.200]   Once upon a time, there was a young man, a young homeschool boy named Isaiah.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.140]   Now, what comes next?
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.380]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.620]   Well, okay.
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.240]   So my homeschool journey started in first grade.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.780]   Good deal.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.780]   So we actually weren't doing CC that year, but that was the year that my mom came home
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.060]   and it was actually just me.
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.940]   She didn't pull my siblings out yet.
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.600]   So for that first year, it was just me and my mom at home trying to figure stuff out.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.860]   And so obviously first grade, I don't remember a lot of the details, but one of the first things
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.760]   that stuck with me that I really think continued that I loved about CC was that mom was here
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.260]   and she was home, right?
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.680]   So I loved being able to play the little math games and do the little like English blurbs
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.820]   and read with her, right?
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.540]   And all of that.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.400]   And it was just something that I had never experienced before.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.580]   And that continued throughout the F&E cycle where she was there at home.
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.000]   She was helping me with my schoolwork.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.900]   It was a family ordeal now and I wasn't doing it by myself.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.780]   So I think that's really the first thing that made an impact on me.
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.120]   Yeah, that's really, that's kind of a precious memory.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.820]   It's going to be really, it's going to really resonate with the moms that are listening to
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.160]   the podcast, Isaiah.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:09.980]   I love what, what resonated most deeply with you was that family experience, the joy that
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.560]   you felt as a little guy, being able to play with your mom and be home with her and do all
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.840]   of that learning together.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.700]   Do you remember if it seemed more like play or more like work or do you not remember that
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.560]   clearly?
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.100]   For that first year, the most, I'll say that, I'll say it this way.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.260]   The things that I remember the most were the play, right?
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.020]   That we used to play like bank with the little bank notes and stuff to learn money and math
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.700]   and all of that.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.560]   So definitely for the earlier stages, I loved the games and that's what I connected with
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.080]   most.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.260]   And that ended up being what I associated school with, right?
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.140]   I think a lot of the times like kids associate school with, you know, homework and the boring
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.700]   stuff, right?
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.460]   But especially whenever you're at home and you're intentional and you're able to hang
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.480]   out with your parents and your siblings and your family, it becomes gamified, right?
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.080]   And it becomes like something that you have fun with.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.680]   So I don't remember it becoming work until a little later on.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.880]   Right, right.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.000]   When I asked my girls, they were homeschooled the whole way too.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.320]   And when I asked them what they remember, they remember like you playing with what we were
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.680]   learning.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.460]   They remember making a store of all their stuffed animals with prices.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.460]   And that's how we did the money thing.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.520]   It's like universal.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.040]   I think I remember that one too.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.960]   Yes, yes.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.040]   But the sweetest thing is that those are very relational memories.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.980]   Those are very relational.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.920]   They are very tied to the heart.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:54.280]   And what parent doesn't want their child's idea about learning to be wrapped in a warm
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.100]   relational memory.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.180]   That's good.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.620]   That's really good.
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.940]   So you said you guys homeschooled and you started with CC early on.
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.040]   And you went all the way through Classical Conversations Challenge Program, right?
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.620]   Yep.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.980]   So starting second grade, I don't remember what cycle it was on, but I've been through all three
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.780]   cycles of foundations, all three years of essentials, and all the challenge programs.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.940]   That is so cool.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:31.200]   And I was asking Isaiah before we started recording, I asked him what he was doing now.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.460]   So tell our listeners, Isaiah, a little bit about what your next chapter is and how you got
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.920]   there.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.340]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:49.060]   So in Challenge 3, so junior year, I started doing CC Plus, which is the partnership that
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.800]   CC has with Southeastern University.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.300]   And so I started doing dual enrollment credits with them, taking classes that pretty much directly
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.780]   aligned with the classes CC was having me do already.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.460]   And so I did that for junior and senior year, was able to graduate with about a fourth of
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.420]   my bachelor's degree already completed.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.980]   So amazing.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.960]   Yeah, I know.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.260]   It's a huge blessing.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.320]   And so now starting here in about a week, actually, I'll be beginning classes at Southeastern University
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.460]   online and continuing with their bachelor program.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.480]   So that's kind of the next step for me.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.940]   That is so exciting.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:34.440]   And I love what you told me, that it really made sense for you to do this next stage of
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.140]   learning in a very financially prudent way.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.020]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.080]   Yeah, I think that's great.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:53.520]   So the move toward debt-free college or post-high school learning anyway.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.600]   I think is really smart.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.700]   And I don't know, I can't, I have asked my girls this before, you know, all the economic
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.060]   stuff that you did as a Challenge One student, did it make you think differently about the
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:14.080]   purchases and the business relationships you entered into as you grew up?
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.120]   And they said, oh, wow, absolutely.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.660]   Is that true for you?
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.740]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.320]   The whatever happened to Penny Candy and the stock market games and all of that.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.260]   And then also I did Dave Ramsey as a high schooler.
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.240]   And so learning that stuff.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.160]   Yes, we did that too.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.840]   So all of that definitely contributed to my decisions for college and my financial decisions
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.640]   that I make now.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.260]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.460]   I like to think, I like to take credit for my daughter's clear thinking.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.320]   And I know you say, well, it's just all the good lessons that we taught you about budgeting
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.400]   and about, you know, counting the cost and weighing the options.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.560]   So I love it that you are on a sound financial footing as a young man.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.760]   I'm just curious about this.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:04.760]   As you look back, because you did foundations and you did all the challenges, so early challenge
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.560]   and later challenge.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:12.240]   Do you have a favorite era of your homeschooling experience?
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.240]   Okay.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.280]   Yes, I think I do.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.540]   And it's kind of a lazy answer.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.260]   That's okay.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.960]   But it's one that I feel pretty deeply about.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.400]   Okay.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.660]   My favorite era was definitely the later, the later stages of challenge.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.260]   Really?
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:36.340]   Because for me, I was seeing my LTW and my EEL, my essentials and my mock trial of challenge
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.600]   B and my logic of A, B, 1, 2, right?
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.640]   So all of that was coming together and the history sentences from essentials, right?
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:50.340]   You start, you start reading the Aeneid, you start reading more about American history and
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.440]   about ancient history.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.720]   And so all of those dots were connecting.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.960]   And so it was really cool for me and my classmates to kind of see that and see the whole CC journey
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.980]   come around, right?
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.560]   And so seeing that and being able to look back and say, okay, this is why we did that.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.200]   This is why we read that book.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.820]   This is why we had that approach, right?
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.920]   And so that was really exciting for me.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.460]   And so that's why I think it was my favorite because I got to see the whole picture finally
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.300]   after so long.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.260]   Oh my gosh.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:25.560]   It is so, um, I hope your mom listens to this podcast and your dad too, because they
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.560]   are just going to be like waving the victory flag.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:35.100]   Every time I hear a young person who has come through the whole program say things like that.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.940]   it connected all the dots.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.040]   I got the purpose.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:46.800]   I reached back and pulled this information ahead and it is just, it is the most profoundly
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:54.500]   moving experience to have ushered children through that learning experience and to have you guys
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.540]   know what you got.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.680]   I, that is just, that's awesome.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.720]   I mean, yeah, it's very rewarding.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.940]   And all families, right?
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:02.580]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.840]   In all families, right?
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.320]   Who graduated.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.000]   Absolutely.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.460]   Absolutely.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:14.400]   I like it that, um, that you were able to see the beauty and the goodness of what you had
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   spent your whole childhood.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.080]   Truth, goodness, and beauty.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.460]   You spent your whole childhood pursuing something that you were then able to sink your teeth into.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.380]   That's awesome.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.340]   That's lovely.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.860]   The next step is the things are so applicable to next steps in life.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.420]   So it doesn't, it doesn't stop.
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.260]   Talk about that a little bit.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.260]   Talk about that.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:41.800]   Uh, I think the biggest thing is the rhetoric and, uh, um, Socratic approach to discussions and
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.020]   to, uh, especially disagreements.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:49.400]   I mean, just, uh, the other night, the other night I was at dinner with several friends and,
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.280]   um, the conversation kind of veered towards some deeper, like theological and, uh,
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.580]   philosophical topics that were hard to talk about, but the tools that CC gave me through
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.100]   debate and through presentations and through mock trial, right?
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.340]   You're, uh, asking good questions, asking good questions, all of the capstone events.
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:15.160]   They, they gave me the tools to be able to, okay, uh, critically and objectively approach
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:22.900]   an issue first and ask those questions, get clarifying, uh, get, uh, definitions, right.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.260]   To know exactly what we're talking about and then to take that and respectfully share my
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.700]   view and listen to the view of others.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.880]   I think that's a skill that's very applicable in any industry that you're going into any,
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.400]   uh, state of life that you're in, whether you're a parent, whether you're a student, whether
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.480]   you're, uh, just graduated college, right.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.620]   These are skills that you use in every aspect of your life, right.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.240]   How to respectfully disagree with one another is I think something that society is sorely
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.280]   missing right now.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.560]   Hey everyone.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.600]   We want to interrupt the show to tell you about the classical learning cohort.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.020]   So the classical learning cohort is comprised of small groups of CC parents learning how
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.760]   to become more confident, competent classical teachers.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.120]   I don't know about you, but being more confident as I'm teaching my children is exactly what I need.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.000]   And the CLC can get me there.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.480]   So the CLC provides a welcome place for mentorship while helping you to practice the classical skills
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.800]   with hospitable assessment with feedback from your peers and your mentors, you will experience
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.440]   the transformative growth as a classical Christian educator.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:44.080]   So right now they're also offering a way for you to test out the CLC for free by attending
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.600]   one of their online events with a CLC mentor.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:55.320]   All you need to do is go to classicalconversations.com forward slash cohort and search experience the
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.800]   CLC to find an event and time that fits your schedule.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.060]   We hope that you enjoy the CLC.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.440]   Let's get back to the show.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:10.600]   I think that the question or, or the, the question, let me rephrase so that I can be
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:17.100]   sure that I understand what you're saying is magic because it makes the other person feel
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:17.620]   heard.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:24.320]   It gives them a chance to hear their words and think, okay, that came out a little more stridently
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.860]   than I'm, or that's not exact.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.400]   Oh, I see where he got that idea, but that's not exactly what I meant.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.360]   And so the two parties can continue to clarify what it is they're thinking.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.480]   That's magic.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.440]   I love that.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:45.020]   And I really appreciate Isaiah that you connected that to the skills that you learned in all of
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.580]   these events.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.780]   Even challenge A and B has so much to teach.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.360]   I am.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.300]   I taught challenge B for a whole lot of years.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.420]   And so it is still like one of my favorite years.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.680]   And, uh, I used to go back after, cause now I've got kids that are, I have CC challenge
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.240]   B graduates that have their own kids now.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.640]   And so that's how long I've been doing it.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.480]   Um, but I have asked lots of kids.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:12.980]   Okay.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:19.880]   So from challenge B, is there anything that you used when you got to college or that you
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.620]   still use?
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.580]   And you know what, almost all of them said, they would tell me what their favorite thing
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.660]   about B was, but then they would say, but also logic.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.460]   Yes.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.000]   Logic.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.560]   That's exactly what I was missing.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.620]   Your truth tables, your syllogism.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.040]   Yes.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:36.540]   Yes.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.360]   Yes.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.700]   We're gonna, we're gonna, um, we're gonna go back to that in a minute.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.500]   Cause I want to ask you some specific questions about challenge B, but all right.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.860]   So you have been a student for a long time and you're still a student.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.940]   Um, be as objective about yourself as you can.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.440]   Okay.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.860]   And describe yourself as a student in three words.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.560]   Okay.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.880]   Let me think for a second here.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:10.100]   Um, the first one that I'll put down is, uh, I'm at heart, definitely a writer.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.060]   I'll say that as my first one.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.540]   I love rhetoric.
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.100]   I love, uh, writing essays.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.440]   I love, uh, thinking through topics and I feel like they always come out a little clearer
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.700]   whenever you put them on a page.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.820]   That is so wise.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.160]   My older daughter says she never really understands what she thinks about something until she writes
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.020]   until you write it down until, uh, cause you get so many different viewpoints from me, even
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.700]   from yourself.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.060]   I surprise myself a lot whenever I'm writing.
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:37.360]   Okay.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.100]   So Isaiah is a writer.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:39.600]   What else?
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.460]   I'm definitely a writer.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.900]   Um, okay.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.080]   I'll put this one down here.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.820]   Uh, it's probably not the most positive thing, but I'm definitely a procrastinator.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.300]   Okay.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.880]   That's something that I struggled with throughout the years.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.160]   Five years.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.620]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:53.980]   Okay.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.080]   Why?
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.220]   Okay.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.240]   Hmm.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.980]   I'm not going to say that, um, you are in good company.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.160]   I, I'm not going to admit that in so many words.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.600]   Why do you think you're a procrastinator?
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.100]   Okay.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:21.160]   I think because, okay, I'll, I'll, I'll answer this objectively because I enjoy writing so
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:21.580]   much.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.720]   And because a lot of the early challenge programs, especially, you know, challenge, uh, one
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.540]   has a lot of essays, uh, and essentials.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.900]   You're writing a lot of essays, right?
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.440]   So I was always able to get those done a little bit faster than I think some of my
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.060]   other peers.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:41.120]   And so I think that kind of started to breed that, oh, I can do this quickly.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.360]   So I don't need to do it now.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.040]   Right.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.920]   And so that kind of bled into later.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.220]   Um, I remember I did a lot of my research for, um, the research paper in challenge one.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.220]   I did it like two, three weeks before.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:53.880]   Sorry, mom.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.980]   If you're listening to this, I did it.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:56.600]   Sorry.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.960]   But, um, that's probably where it started.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.120]   You know, uh, you take something that you're good at and you take advantage of it and then
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.700]   it starts to bleed into the things that you're not as gifted in.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.500]   Yes.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.160]   Isaiah, that's really good.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.580]   That's really wise that you recognize that about yourself.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:18.940]   Let me ask you this, and this might be, this might be more truth than you want to tell on
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.400]   a podcast.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.660]   And we can say to your parents, stop listening right here at this minute.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:28.660]   Um, has it ever bitten you your proclivity to procrastination?
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:37.680]   procrastinate and what are you doing to ameliorate that situation so that it doesn't harm you
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.620]   in the future?
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:44.660]   So this is actually, uh, yeah, some of the list of questions that you sent me, this is
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.920]   kind of what I wanted to talk about.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:51.740]   But, um, in challenge a, the first thing that comes to mind, um, challenge, my challenge a
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.540]   year was right whenever COVID was starting.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.700]   It was ending right as COVID was starting.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.040]   Yep.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.700]   So the last few weeks I remember, um, we were all at home, right?
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.360]   We remember the lockdown, all that stuff.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.020]   And challenge a, the capstone project is you draw the world for cartography, right?
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:15.980]   And so I had gotten, um, about through North America, South America, and Europe, a little
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:16.680]   bit of Africa.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.980]   And then, um, that procrastination hit, I stopped trying.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:25.940]   Oh no, you have all that, those little, all those little, you have all of the Asia, right?
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.340]   The Middle Eastern countries.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:34.880]   So for blue books hosted at home, uh, I wasn't able to complete it all by myself and I wasn't
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.320]   able to finish that capstone project and I had to put a little bit of extra work in to
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.200]   be able to do it later.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.580]   And that blended to my summer, right?
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.040]   And so that was definitely the first time where I was like, dang, okay, it's time to work.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.460]   I was the master of my destiny and I let myself down here.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.780]   So yeah, exactly.
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.300]   And, um, yeah, what, what was the second part of that question?
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:54.660]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.020]   So, well, I, this was just us.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:07.720]   Um, well, also how are you trying to get over your proclivity to procrastinate or are you?
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.280]   Well, I think the biggest tools, first I'll answer.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:11.660]   Yes.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.400]   Always.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:12.820]   Yes.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.040]   Always try to improve.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.700]   Always try and strengthen your weaknesses.
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.300]   Yep.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:16.940]   Good job.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:23.760]   The best thing that I have done and that I'm continuing to do is to plan, right?
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:30.340]   You get, um, you get a planner, you get a snapshot of your semester, you know, what's coming so
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.940]   that, you know, maybe the things that you're better at, okay, I can spend more time on that
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.240]   science project that I know I'm going to struggle with.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.680]   Right.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.600]   Or that I don't love and I will put off.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.200]   Exactly.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.400]   So no, you need to know yourself well, you need to know your limits and your strengths well,
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:52.820]   and you need to plan, put on paper, put it down, uh, nail yourself to a schedule and
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.680]   stick to that.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.660]   And obviously, you know, there can be wiggle room should accentuating circumstances happen.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:03.180]   But that's the biggest thing that I'll say to procrastinators is make a schedule, manage
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.740]   your time well, and stick to it.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.520]   It takes commitment, takes time.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.100]   It's difficult whenever you have that, you know, movie that you want to go see, but you
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.280]   still have a project due, right?
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.440]   But it helps all in the future.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.700]   And so that's, that's the thing that I'm trying to work through the most.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.180]   That's really good.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.640]   That shows a lot of growth.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:24.280]   I will tell you this, um, something that my husband always said to our girls when they
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:30.500]   were growing up that goes along with what you were saying about making plans and, and forcing
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.980]   yourself to stick to it.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:38.860]   He always told them, you need to learn to be a promise keeper, but you need to learn first
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.280]   to keep promises to yourself.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.540]   That's good.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.480]   You need to keep the promises that you make to yourself.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.520]   So like a schedule.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.460]   Okay.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.220]   Yep.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:48.940]   It's time.
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.580]   I said that I was going to have this done by this date.
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:57.900]   If it's not done, then I guess I'm not going to the movie or I guess I'm not going to hang
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.780]   out at the lake, you know, keep the promise to yourself because you know, you made the promise
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.580]   for a reason.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:04.160]   Yep.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:04.640]   That's good.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.520]   I love that.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:05.960]   Okay.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:12.240]   So you said that the cartography project at the end of challenge A is something that you
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:12.660]   remembered.
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.720]   Well, is that, um, what you remember most about challenge A?
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.540]   Um, oof.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.460]   Cartography and science fair.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.440]   Definitely the two things that I remember the most.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:30.300]   I think the other thing that I would have to say is like pinned in my brain is I got second
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.380]   place in the science fair.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.300]   We got second place.
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.180]   I was so close.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.760]   But, um, science fair is that first thing in challenge A where you kind of take the step
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:44.160]   up from presentations and you kind of take that further to the next step.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.600]   And I really enjoyed doing that.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.900]   I enjoyed doing research and putting together a board.
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.340]   And so that would be the other thing where I'm like, okay, I remember that and it's fun
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.300]   and it was fun.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.140]   That's a good thing.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:59.720]   You know, I think the thing, what I remember about, um, cause years and years ago, science
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.780]   fair was in challenge B.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.720]   So I had lots of experience with that.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.900]   And then I had two girls who went through the same thing.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:12.140]   Um, the thing I really appreciate about the science fair is that it is perhaps one of the
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:20.140]   first times that the students have a long range project, something that they find out about
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:25.060]   way back here, but it's not due until way over here.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:33.600]   And so that's the first time that they have to sort of manage a schedule that maybe nobody
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.660]   will know that you're way off track for weeks and weeks.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:44.160]   And that can be a very freeing thing, but it can bite you too.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.500]   Oh, exactly.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.340]   So, yeah, I think those are good.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.240]   So what do you think?
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.120]   What are the, okay, think really hard for a few minutes.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:23:00.260]   What are the major lessons you feel like you learned from challenge A?
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.440]   Honestly, I think it's exactly what we've been talking about is taking responsibility.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:11.060]   You know, it's the first time that you as a student is taking responsibility for your own
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:11.580]   education.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:18.500]   And I love that CC does that so early because you're not even in high school yet, but you
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.220]   and you alone are largely responsible for making sure your work is getting done.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.940]   And just exactly like you said, it's so freeing.
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:32.260]   But then also if you don't do that math lesson and then you fall continuously behind in a few
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.000]   weeks, your mom's going to find out and you're going to be a month behind.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.760]   And so that's, it's going to bite you pretty bad.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:44.600]   So the biggest lesson and the biggest wisdom that I gleaned from challenge A is definitely
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.320]   just get it done now.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.880]   So you won't have to do more later.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.680]   Right.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.320]   Okay.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.620]   Time management and that, that schedule.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.160]   Stick to it.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.260]   Yep.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:53.980]   Yep.
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:24:00.200]   Ownership and discipline are huge lessons to learn at the, and that fits in with challenge
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:00.720]   A and B.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:08.040]   Those are huge lessons to learn as you are moving from being a little kid that mom is
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:14.800]   pretty much, you know, even if, if mom's not really spoon feeding you through your upper
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.240]   foundations years, mom is still kind of pulling the strings and making sure that everything's
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:20.900]   in the backpack.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.300]   Mom owns the schedule.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:22.860]   Yes.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:30.540]   But in challenge A and B, students need to start learning to own the schedule and to
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.340]   flex their own discipline muscles.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:39.060]   And I think that you are absolutely right about that and that there is freedom involved.
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.100]   Absolutely.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:46.500]   And, and it's great for families to celebrate that growth and that freedom together.
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:56.260]   Do you ever, do you ever remember making, um, an unfortunate choice about how to spend your
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:03.000]   time, um, that, that, that your parents let you feel the consequences of?
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.080]   Well, I think, uh, one thing that I admire about my parents is they've always kind of,
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.340]   obviously not for like, uh, very serious things.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.700]   Not safety things.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.300]   Yes.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.820]   But, uh, they've let us feel the consequences of our decisions.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.780]   So there have been more times than I can count where, you know, they said, okay, uh, we're
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.480]   going to trust you as long as this thing's done, you can go and do that.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.040]   And that thing hasn't been done and it's bitten me later on.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.280]   Right.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.320]   And there's been no, uh, safety rope in those instances.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.100]   Like they, they let me feel the consequences.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.720]   I've had to stay home and work late and miss things.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.860]   And, you know, and I've had to feel those punishments.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.940]   And I think that that's good.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.820]   And I think that that was healthy because, you know, it discouraged me from doing it later
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:53.060]   on, even though sometimes I did, uh, you know, but at least you knew the lesson was
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.340]   going to be learned, was going to be felt by you.
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.880]   You were going to be the master of your consequences as well as your choices.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.820]   And yeah, sin catches up with you.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.300]   Oh my goodness.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.120]   That's so true.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:10.180]   So is that, is that the biggest piece of advice you would give to students who are moving from
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:18.620]   the foundations essentials years into challenge, um, you know, buck up and learn to take responsibility
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.540]   for your choices?
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.680]   Time management.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.440]   Okay.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:28.100]   Those are the two words that saved my life in challenge A and B especially is time management.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.740]   So did you just know how to manage your time or did your parents help you?
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.440]   Absolutely not.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.520]   I had a lot of help from my parents and my, uh, tutors and my mom was actually my tutor
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.640]   for my A and B year.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:45.380]   I was like kind of an added connection there, but yeah, everybody's schedule is different.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.880]   You can't go off your siblings.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.080]   You can't go off your class.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:48.560]   That's true.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.280]   That's true.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.900]   You need to figure out, okay, what commitments do I have?
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.840]   Do I have violin practice?
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.440]   Do I have sports practice?
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:55.720]   Right.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.620]   What non-negotiables do I have on the table?
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.340]   And how can I use that schedule to build school around?
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.040]   Right.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.740]   So obviously make your priorities first, right?
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.940]   I want to, I want to make sure that I'm maintaining a relationship with my family.
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.540]   I want to make sure that I'm doing my school and doing it well, getting good grades.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.080]   Then you want to have friends.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.040]   You want to have a social life.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.440]   You want to be doing something outside.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.740]   So prioritize that, figure that list out.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.960]   Then from that, make your schedule, manage your time well, and you're going to have fun.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.520]   And it's going to be great because the magic of homeschooling is that you get to create your
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.320]   own schedule, right?
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.500]   You're not stuck in a classroom for eight to nine hours a day.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.360]   So you get to be out in the world, spending time with friends, going to see the movies,
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.440]   going on that weekend trip to the beach, right?
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.800]   But it all starts with knowing your priorities and making a schedule from that.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.780]   Have you ever wished that you could just help your student continue the momentum that they
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.900]   started in classical conversations in a college environment?
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.960]   Guess what?
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.180]   Judson College is exactly what you've been looking for.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:04.320]   This semester, Judson College is sponsoring the Everyday Educator, and we are so excited to
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.820]   partner with them because we really believe that they have exactly what our students could
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.060]   need for the next leg of their education journey.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.700]   Let me tell you more about it.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:19.200]   So Judson College really values Christian education, and they exist to equip students
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.400]   who want to give their lives for the cause of Christ, wherever he might call them.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   So that means that they're not just helping students who want to go into vocational ministry,
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.280]   but also students who want to live in the marketplace.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:35.500]   Judson College also has a specific community plan for their students.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:41.540]   They have smaller class sizes that allow students to have individual relationships with the faculty,
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.960]   and that also helps them to get the attention that they need so that they can learn and grow
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.740]   as professionals.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:52.040]   Outside of the classroom, they also have what they call the house system, and that provides
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:58.180]   a vibrant student-led community where students make lifelong friendships and participate in house
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:03.280]   competitions and experience deep community all the way from freshman year to graduation.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:09.800]   Lastly, something I found absolutely fascinating was that they have a classical emphasis.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:15.420]   So they have a great books course, which is required for every single degree in undergrad.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:21.020]   And in that course, they focus on the history of human ideas through a biblical worldview.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:27.900]   And that allows the students to develop as readers, writers, and researchers as they grow as committed
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.900]   followers of Christ.

[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.040]   Let's get back to the show.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.940]   I love that.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.420]   That's such good advice.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.440]   Okay, guys, you heard it from Isaiah.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.680]   You heard it from Isaiah.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.060]   You need to get your priorities straight.
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:54.880]   You need to work with your family so that you can get ahead of your schedule and be honest
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.360]   about what you're going to do.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:02.400]   I remember trying to explain to my girls, okay, your schedule is not working because you're
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.340]   putting down things like you're going to do school on Saturday and Sunday.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.040]   And we know that you're not.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.680]   You are planning to fail when you do that.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.200]   So be really honest about your schedule.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:19.320]   And if you're not good at guesstimating how long something will take, ask your parents to
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.800]   help you.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:26.360]   They might not know all the ins and outs of your logic or your Latin declensions, but
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.820]   they do know how to make a schedule.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.320]   So do that.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.940]   So did you love Challenge B?
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.460]   Did you like Challenge B?
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.500]   Oh, I mean, easy answer is yes.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.600]   I think absolutely.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.900]   Especially looking back.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.980]   I mean, I think you kind of have a warped view of things whenever you're going through
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.120]   school, especially as a late, middle, early high schooler.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.500]   Yes.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.120]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.860]   What did you like the most?
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.440]   And then what did you like the least about Challenge B?
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:04.980]   So for me, being more rhetoric oriented, I think I really enjoyed the logic and getting
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:11.380]   that kind of framework for how to think and how to, because I mean, really, it is a cheat
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.800]   sheet for all conversations and all things like that.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:13.940]   It is.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.480]   It is so awesome.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.460]   It is so applicable to life.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:17.860]   Yeah.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.600]   And it was more, it was a little more difficult for me because it's more mathematically oriented.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.420]   It's math with words.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.260]   Exactly.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:29.120]   It's math with words, but it really helped me a lot.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.480]   And then also just mock trial.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:36.120]   I loved, I was an attorney and I loved being up there and, you know, it was great.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.080]   It was great.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.260]   I love, I loved that.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.820]   So those two were definitely my favorites.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.820]   I'm not sure which one I would put above it.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.640]   But least favorite.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.100]   Okay.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.360]   Challenge B.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.460]   My mom was my tutor.
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.660]   We were coming off of COVID.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.060]   Oh gosh, I keep forgetting that.
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.700]   That would flavor everything.
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.400]   I know.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:55.700]   Right.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.760]   And I was kind of a punk kid, if I've got to be honest.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:58.960]   Okay.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.440]   Okay.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.220]   Were you a little bit of a hard head there, Isaiah?
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:02.780]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.980]   I was a little, I was a little bit rebellious, if you'd like to say that.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:11.180]   But yeah, so that caused a lot of tension, both at home and in the classroom, because my
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.020]   mom was both a tutor and teacher.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:20.160]   And so least favorite thing about Challenge B was, I think, just having to go through that
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.360]   and which all fault of my own, obviously.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.860]   But that kind of was a tarnish on Challenge B year for me.
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:32.520]   But through that, I mean, now my mom and I have a great relationship and she was able to
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.020]   help me through a lot of stuff in the later Challenge years and in the early Challenge years.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:41.480]   So I wouldn't change a thing, but that was definitely something that kind of was a blemish
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.480]   on the record.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.100]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.900]   You know, Isaiah, I don't think that that is unusual.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:55.800]   I bet if you talked to a hundred students who came through homeschooling and that came
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.900]   through CC, that it would be way more than 50 percent that would say, yeah, I had a little
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.220]   bit of a rebellious year.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.260]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.360]   Challenge B year.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:13.060]   You know, you've got these 13 year old kids and they're changing and and you're growing and
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:18.620]   your your mind is growing and your ability to think is growing and your emotions are growing.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:21.780]   And yeah, it's just a wild year.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.020]   Now, I for some odd reason, it is my favorite.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.700]   I've tutored different challenge levels.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.620]   It's my favorite.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:35.840]   And I really enjoyed those confounding, exasperating, punky students.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.200]   I really did.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.520]   I really did enjoy them.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.940]   It's like I loved rest.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:45.020]   I love to watch them wrestle with who they were going to become.
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:45.740]   Oh, that's good.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:51.240]   You can see that these students who are and parents, this is for you.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:59.200]   And these students who are pushing against you at every turn are going to become amazing
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:33:59.820]   people.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.000]   They are just they are.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.640]   Unfortunately, they are using you as the sandpaper to knock off the rough edges.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.000]   But there's a diamond in the rough under there.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.680]   And so I think, Isaiah, probably a lot of what you learned to appreciate about your mom,
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.520]   you learned in challenge B.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.580]   Oh, I think so.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.780]   What's the difference?
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:29.800]   So how how in your mind is challenge B different than challenge A?
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:36.500]   Not the courses, of course, but but what's expected of you or what you can expect of yourself?
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.540]   Yeah, that's that's a really good question.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.520]   I think in my view, in my opinion.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:50.940]   I view A as kind of the transition between essentials and the challenge levels, because you still have
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.420]   that little bit of owner, you still are taking ownership.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:58.760]   But it's still relatively simple when it comes to requirement.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.540]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.860]   And tasks, right?
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.260]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:08.100]   A little later, especially in challenge one, two, you start to get more task heavy.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:08.740]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:12.480]   So challenge A, I view as kind of like an easing in.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.480]   I know sometimes it always doesn't feel like that.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:23.340]   But challenge B, the part I really enjoyed and the main difference that I saw was the emphasis
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:27.640]   on logic and the integration of that into all of the subjects, really.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.720]   We talked about how it's math, it's exposition, it's debate, right?
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.940]   It ties into all of these different things.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.840]   And challenge A, you're doing fallacy detective, you're doing analogies, right?
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:44.440]   And so it's a big step up to now start talking about syllogisms and the truth tables, right?
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.680]   And your square of opposition.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.640]   And so challenge B requires a lot more out of the student.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.160]   But the beauty of it is almost all of them step up, right?
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:00.240]   And you get to see each student and each person click with a certain subject, right?
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.560]   Some people love the logic.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.260]   Some people love the math.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.520]   Some people love the science, right?
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.520]   And so that's when you really start seeing these different personalities come out exactly
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.820]   like you were saying, why challenge B is your favorite.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.160]   Like that's going to continue through the challenge levels where you're going to get people who,
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.540]   what's the word that I'm looking at?
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:23.260]   Who excel in debate and who excel in senior thesis.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:27.780]   And then you get the people who excel in mathematics and science and physics, right?
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:33.240]   And so the main difference is that challenge A is your transitional period.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.380]   But challenge B is when you really see students start to become who they're going to be.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.360]   That's beautiful.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   I like that.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:55.840]   Years and years ago, when we were just finding out about classical conversations, I had a conversation with Lee Bortons and she was explaining her vision of the challenge program.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:04.520]   And she had a lot of understanding, a lot of relational wisdom and understanding the way people grow and how they think.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:17.580]   And she said, you know what, it's really hard for hard when we ask young people to do too many really hard things at once to undergo too much change at the same time.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:27.460]   And she said, so challenge A is really hard, maybe emotionally and developmentally, because there's a lot of change.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:35.960]   You are, you are moving away, you're moving toward having somebody else help direct some of your studies.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.680]   It's not just mom who's being your tutor.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:44.180]   And so you're learning to be, as you have said, responsible for yourself.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:45.400]   And so that's hard.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.920]   So the academics is not as hard.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:53.800]   By challenge B, you've kind of figured this out a little bit.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.720]   You are learning to be responsible and make your own plans.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.740]   So emotionally, it's easier, but the work is harder.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.180]   The academics are harder.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.580]   And so there's just an ebb and flow.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:15.400]   And I love that your experience really bears out the wisdom that she had all those years ago in planning the challenge years.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.060]   Almost like you planned it, yeah.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.520]   Yeah, you felt it.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.360]   You felt it.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:39.680]   Okay, so you have given us so much to think about and so much insight into how challenge A and B can begin this journey of learning for a lifetime or continue it.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:39:00.680]   What are some of the skills and knowledge that you learned in those early challenge years that really did help you hold to the road and stay in your lane and keep learning and keep growing and keep embracing what the Lord had for you academically?
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.980]   That's a good question, yeah.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:09.860]   The things that were most impactful in my education were the anti-chart and the outline.
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.000]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.720]   I made an anti-chart yesterday.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.360]   And see, exactly.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.700]   You use them all the time.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.060]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:24.280]   And so when you write them down on paper, you usually get the most content, right?
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:29.580]   But in any situation, say like you're flying somewhere for the parents, right?
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.620]   And your flight gets delayed.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.260]   Okay, cool.
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.180]   You can make an anti-chart.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.100]   Okay, what's the negative about the situation?
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.240]   What's the affirmative?
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.620]   What's like the worst that can happen?
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.540]   What can I do now?
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.700]   What are my steps going forward?
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.760]   And what are some things that I can do if I have a layover, right?
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.180]   So you make the anti-chart.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.600]   Cool.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.080]   Outline format.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.460]   We're having a conversation right now.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.020]   You have your point one, your point two, your point three, and your subproofs.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.040]   Cool.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.800]   You add an exorbitum to spice it up.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.940]   You add some refutation in there, right?
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.340]   My challenge students who are listening right now, they know what I'm talking about.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:07.900]   But these things are great writing tools, but they're great life tools, right?
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:14.900]   And so taking that forward, people ask like parents and students that haven't done CC ask
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.860]   me all the time, like, okay, but homeschooling was great, but did it actually teach you anything?
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.060]   Yes.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.660]   Overwhelmingly, yes.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.980]   Like even more so than just like factual knowledge, which I also did.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.320]   But you learn how to ask questions.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.360]   And I mean, Lee Borton says it all the time.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.000]   You're not learning what to learn.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.540]   You're learning how to learn.
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:34.960]   Yes.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:40.040]   And so all of these tools that you're putting together and you're connecting the dots, you're
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:45.520]   putting together your personality and you're applying that to the world, right?
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:50.580]   You become confident in who you are and you become confident in how to approach a situation
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:55.560]   and how to ask questions and how to dig deeper and how to make a relationship stronger.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.640]   And so those are things that I think I'll take with me my entire life.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:06.260]   And so it's been extremely, extremely beautiful to see that play out, even in the last six,
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.460]   seven months that I've been graduated.
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.300]   That's so great.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.960]   That is so great.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.260]   Okay.
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.360]   So here's my final question for you.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.820]   You have shared so much wisdom.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:20.800]   I know that there are parents everywhere listening to this that are writing as fast and furiously
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.820]   as they can to get this all down.
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.200]   Thanks for sharing it with us.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.620]   Here's my last question for you.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:31.220]   What are you excited about learning next?
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:38.120]   So my degree right now is I've declared a business administration degree.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:44.520]   And my dream and my goal in that is some type of leadership position.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:49.260]   I currently, I'm a manager at a Chick-fil-A here locally in Southern Pines.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:56.460]   And I've discovered that I really thrive and I love that kind of management, those leadership
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.720]   problems and being able to solve those things.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:05.460]   So I'm really looking forward to applying what CC has taught me and how to look objectively at
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.480]   a problem and how to find a solution.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.740]   And I'm looking forward to learning how to apply that more towards leadership and learning
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:16.800]   more about what it means to be not just an efficient, but also a godly leader.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.540]   Isaiah, you're going to do it.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.000]   I feel like you're going to do it.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.080]   Thank you so much.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.260]   I have enjoyed getting to know you today.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:24.920]   No, thank you.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.040]   This has been an honor.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.400]   This has been great.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.080]   Okay, guys.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.280]   Well, that's a wrap on today.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.360]   Thank you for joining us today.
