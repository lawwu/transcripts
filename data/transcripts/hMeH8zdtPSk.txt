[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.740]   I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but Christ lives in me.
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.860]   Christ who is our life. He is in His church, not in the building, but He has taken up
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.340]   residence in the people. If you have Christ, you have the Spirit of Christ. Christ cannot,
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.480]   will not forsake His true church. When you commune with the true and living church,
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.260]   you're communing with the true and living Christ.
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.500]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.960]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:01:08.660]   If you go back to Exodus 28, Exodus 29, Exodus 39, you'll see that that sash is what the
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:16.740]   high priest wore. So here we see not only is Christ in His church, but He is interceding
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.560]   for His church. He is interceding for His church. He is acting in behalf of His church.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:35.700]   That is so comforting. I pray for this church.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.640]   Without doubt, I pray for this church.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.860]   Without ceasing, we all, I trust, pray for the well-being and blessing and usefulness
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:58.560]   of the church. And while our prayers are inevitable because we care, there is one whose prayers
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.100]   are infinitely greater than ours, and that is the Son of Man Himself who intercedes on
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.080]   behalf of His church.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.520]   Hebrews 2:17 identifies Him as a merciful and faithful high priest, able to come to
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:24.320]   the aid of those who are tempted. He's always interceding with the Father. Hebrews 3:16,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:35.580]   "Jesus, the high priest of our confession, faithful over His house whose house we are."
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.240]   Always interceding for us. Always before the throne. Always before the throne. Always before
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.360]   the throne. Satan, the accuser, may come and accuse believers. Christ is their defender.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.000]   Hebrews 4:15, "A high priest who can sympathize with our weaknesses."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.580]   Jesus comes to the Father the night of His betrayal. And He says in verse 6, "I have
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.980]   manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.040]   You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word."
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.460]   They have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You. For the words which
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.220]   You gave Me I have given to them, and they received them and truly understood that I
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.960]   came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me. So they accepted the truth.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:30.000]   Now, verse 9, "I ask on their behalf. I do not ask on behalf of the world. I am not interceding
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.840]   for the world, but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours, and all the
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.100]   things that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I have been glorified in them.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.080]   I am praying for them."
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.520]   What am I praying? Down in verse 15, "I do not ask You to take them out of the world,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.180]   but to keep them from the evil one." Verse 17, "Sanctify them in the truth. Your word
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.640]   is truth." Verse 18, "As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.200]   world." Verse 20, "I do not ask on behalf of these alone, these disciples, but for those
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.240]   also who believe in Me through their word, the next generation of believers, that they
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.160]   may all be one for their unity, even as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.300]   may be in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me."
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:37.440]   I'm praying for the sanctification and the understanding and the power.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:49.900]   "Of each successive generation of believers." "Father," verse 24, "I desire that they also
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:58.240]   whom You have given Me be with Me where I am." I'm praying them into heaven. I'm praying
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   them into heaven. Do you think the Father hears the Son's prayers? The Son always prays
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.420]   according to the will of the Father. You even have a promise in John 14 that if you
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.060]   pray according to the will of the Son, your prayers will be answered. The Son always prays
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.320]   according to the will of the Father, and the will of the Father is that none of these perish.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.880]   They are secured not by the statement of that fact, but by the intervention of the high
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.040]   priest.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.940]   Those who are the true church will not be lost. "All that the Father gives to Me," John
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.200]   6, "will come to Me; and whoever comes to Me, I will not turn away, but I will raise
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.740]   him in the last day." From election to glorification, that's settled. Whom the Father chose, He
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.360]   justified whom He justified. He sanctifies, Romans 8, whom He sanctifies, He glorifies.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:06.840]   Nobody falls through the cracks. It's good to reflect on Romans 8 with that regard. I
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:15.720]   hope you will. If God is for us, who is against us? "He who didn't spare His own Son, but delivered
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.920]   Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?" Who will
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.600]   bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who justifies. Who is the one who
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.680]   condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, then this: "Yea, rather who was raised, who is
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.640]   at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us."
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:44.320]   So who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:52.640]   or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? No. "And all these things we overwhelmingly
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.140]   conquer through Him who loved us. I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.880]   nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.880]   any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.440]   Jesus our Lord." We're secure.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.060]   We're secured in that relationship by the intercession of Christ. So the good news,
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:19.920]   folks, the church is still the church, right? It's still the church. He will lose none of
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.740]   them.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:30.900]   There's a moment in chapter 18 that has always struck me, chapter 18 of John. Judas betrays
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.240]   Jesus.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:49.080]   Jesus protects His disciples. It's a pretty amazing scene. They come into the garden,
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:57.540]   the soldiers, Judas having betrayed Jesus. "He said to them, 'I am He. I am the one you
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.300]   look for.' They drew back and fell to the ground. Therefore again He asked them, 'Whom
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.040]   do you seek?'" Same thing He asked them in verse 14. "And they said, 'I am He, and I
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.040]   am the one you seek.'"
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:13.920]   Verse 4, the second time, "They said, 'Jesus the Nazarene.'" Why did He ask them twice?
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.880]   Verse 8, "Jesus answered, 'I told you that I am He. If you seek Me, let these go their
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.260]   way.'" That is an incredible moment.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:35.840]   Jesus knew that the disciples could not withstand what would happen if they were arrested.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.360]   So He made sure it never happened.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:48.840]   You understand that? We are secured because He controls the circumstances.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:57.160]   Twice He makes the Romans say publicly they have no warrant for anybody else but Him.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:05.640]   And He said that to protect them, to fulfill Scripture in verse 9, "Of those whom you have
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.640]   lost, I have lost no one."
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.400]   It isn't just that He doesn't lose you because He says He won't. He doesn't lose you because
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:21.520]   He controls the circumstances by which you could be lost.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:35.440]   What is Christ doing in His church? He's alive in His church, giving life to His true church,
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:44.760]   leading to the Father on behalf of His church to bring them to the New Jerusalem.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.760]   That takes us to verse 14.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.280]   We go from what He was wearing to His own person.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:04.040]   His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow, and His eyes were like a
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.240]   flame of fire.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:11.160]   And His feet were like burnished bronze.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.100]   John has gone from his clothing now to his person, his head, his hair, his eyes, his
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.320]   feet.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:25.800]   And soon it will be his voice, his hand, his mouth, his face.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.640]   We're getting a picture of the exalted Christ.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.040]   His head and His hair were like white wool, like snow.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.660]   Daniel 7:9, that Messianic passage where we find the term "Son of Man," describes God
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.600]   the Almighty in the same way.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.460]   So Christ bears the same characteristics as God the Almighty.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:55.080]   The white here is leucon , not a flat white, but a blazing white, a shining
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.740]   white, like light white.
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.740]   What does this mean?
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.840]   Well, it means He's uncorrupted by evil, pure light.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:12.220]   Blazing glory, the white light of His eternal, glorious, pure holiness.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:23.120]   Now out of that blazing, pure holiness, the Shekinah that appeared even in the garden,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.680]   came two penetrating streams like lasers.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.560]   John sees this, and the face of Christ is a blazing light, and coming out of it are
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.640]   two laser beams.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   Flames.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:46.180]   His eyes were like a flame of fire, like flaming torches in Daniel 10:6.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.180]   What is this?
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.000]   Penetrating holy intelligence.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.600]   This is omniscience.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.160]   Hebrews 4:13 says, "There is no creature hidden from His sight, and all things are
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.240]   laid bare to His eyes."
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.840]   He misses nothing.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.440]   He intercedes for His church.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:12.500]   And at the same time, nothing will cause Him to stop loving His church.
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:20.560]   Nothing will cause Him to take back forgiveness for the sins of His church.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:28.480]   But that does not mean He is indifferent to their sin.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.240]   Jonah tried to hide, didn't he, to run from God?
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.240]   Then to go down deep in the Shekinah.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   He was in the ship to hide.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:41.000]   He can't hide from God.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.380]   The Lord is present in His church.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:51.100]   He's interceding for His church, and He's also looking with laser holiness at the behavior
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.100]   of His church.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:58.060]   According to 2 Corinthians 11:3, He wants the bride to be a chaste virgin.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.220]   He wants to present a chaste virgin to Christ.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.040]   That's Paul's desire.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:13.380]   The Lord Jesus Christ gave His life to sanctify and cleanse the church.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:21.320]   He wants, Ephesians 5, a pure bride, as in 2 Corinthians 11.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.940]   He wants the church holy, so that the first instruction that comes to the church is Matthew
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.400]   18, and if somebody sins, you go to them, you confront the sin.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.040]   They don't repent, you take two or three witnesses.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.280]   If they don't repent, you tell the church.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.840]   If they still don't repent, you put them out.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:41.240]   He wants purity in His church to the degree that if you're a sinful Christian, you could
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.760]   lose your life as some in Corinth did because they desecrated the Lord's table.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:53.340]   They were sick, and some of them died.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:59.860]   Ananias and Sapphira died in front of the whole church for lying to the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.640]   Another way to look at that metaphorically is in the language of John 15, where the Lord
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:10.020]   says, "Our Lord says every branch He purges."
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:21.360]   For love of Christ, for joy, for usefulness, for witness, He confronts the sin of His church.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.580]   Judgment in the church, He will judge.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.040]   How does He judge?
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:33.440]   Could be by death, could be by illness, could be by exposure.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:47.520]   But His judgment is severe, blazing, molten, pure, refined, gleaming feet of judgment.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:57.360]   He wants His church so pure that He will not hesitate to bring judgment on the church.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.800]   Is Christ moving in His church?
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.720]   He is.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.240]   He's alive in His church.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:14.340]   He's interceding for His church, and He is with pure, holy omniscience, fully aware of
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:21.740]   the sins of His people, and will bring judgment on them.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.560]   It doesn't mean the loss of salvation.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:33.040]   It does mean the loss of joy, and could mean the loss of life.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.520]   John is being encouraged.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:44.200]   The Lord wants the purity of the church more than He does.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:50.500]   As you come to the second part of verse 15, there's a fourth picture.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.040]   His voice was like the sound of many waters.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.800]   One of the things you notice if you visit Patmos, and you would see it on any island,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.840]   the waves are pounding that small rock on all shores.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.620]   There's no beach.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.900]   It's noisy.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.920]   It's actually thunderous, the sound of many waters.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.240]   We find that all the way back in Ezekiel 43.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.480]   That was a metaphor that people used when they wanted to talk about something that was
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.780]   loud and commanding.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.420]   What is this telling us?
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.420]   That He commands His church.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.680]   He speaks with authority to His church.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.640]   His voice is like the sound of many waters.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:44.880]   I've been watching some of the nonsense going on with some churches trying to downplay homosexuality.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.400]   And what's become a popular phrase is that God speaks loudly about a lot of sins, but
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.740]   He whispers about homosexuality.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.420]   That's been on the internet.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.940]   That folly has been spread around.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.860]   God whispers about homosexuality.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.440]   I don't think He was willing to do that.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.280]   He was whispering in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.640]   Before the lava buried them all, the noise would have been more than anyone had ever
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.960]   heard perhaps in their entire life.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.720]   God doesn't whisper about transgressions.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:32.240]   He speaks with crashing authority, like waves pounding the shoreline of rocks.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.240]   He speaks with all authority.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.240]   He speaks with all authority.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   He speaks with all authority.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:41.720]   The voice that John heard back in verse 10 was loud, perhaps an angelic voice, or perhaps
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.900]   the voice of the Lord.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.120]   This takes it up a few notches.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.780]   "All authority is given unto me in heaven and earth," he said, didn't he?
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.280]   And His Word speaks with authority.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:02.040]   That's why Titus says, "Speak with all authority."
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:13.660]   So the good news is the Lord is speaking to His church, His true church, with authority.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.660]   We know where that comes from.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:20.540]   It comes from His Word.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:27.800]   There's a fifth aspect of this vision that encourages John and us.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.840]   In His right hand, He held seven stars.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:38.240]   Let's just say He controls His church.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.240]   He controls His church.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.500]   What are these seven stars?
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.080]   Down in verse 20 it says, "They are the angels," or better, "the messengers.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.600]   They are the leaders, the shepherds."
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.740]   It's the word angelos , and it is often translated angels, of course, but it's the same word
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.140]   for messengers.
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.140]   This is good news.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.380]   He controls the leaders in His church.
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.640]   He will never be without faithful leaders.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.340]   He will always have faithful leaders.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.920]   He will always have godly leaders.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:18.520]   You may have to sort through the pile to get to them, but He gave Ephesians 4 to His church,
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:24.980]   evangelists, pastors, evangelists, teaching pastors, as He gave apostles and prophets in
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.820]   the past.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.440]   He always has faithful leaders.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:38.120]   So what is He doing in His church?
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:48.080]   He's alive in His church, purifying His church, interceding for His church, proclaiming truth
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:54.200]   to His church, disciplining His church when necessary.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.040]   And I love this, back to verse 16, "protecting His church."
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.240]   "Out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.760]   He will protect His church."
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.060]   He gave His church instruction in 2 Peter to be able to recognize false teachers.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.400]   He repeated it in the book of Jude.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.020]   He warned in the final epistles, 1, 2, and 3 John, about how important the truth was
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:21.360]   and not to listen to anybody who said something that wasn't true.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.580]   But as much as we're concerned about that, He's even more concerned about it.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:31.040]   And so He protects His true church, and He does it by faithful shepherds, faithful messengers.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.040]   He's a faithful shepherds.
