[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   I think that we are extraordinarily sub-optimized in our social lives.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.180]   We are facing right now an epidemic of loneliness, depression, even self-harm has increased.
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.160]   I mean, there is a lot of really troubling trends in our well-being, and I think a lot
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.260]   of those have to do with a great sense of disconnection that we have, a sense of isolation
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.000]   and atomization.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.440]   That is simply not an optimized way to live because we are fundamentally social creatures.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.240]   In essence, cynicism is at this point a barricade.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.560]   It's blocking us from the types of connections that most of us want, and even if we don't
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.700]   know we want them, we need them to optimize our own lives and our culture.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.560]   I think of optimization not just at the personal level.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.320]   You talked about it at the family level, which I think is so important, but it's also a cultural
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.320]   thing, right?
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.760]   The ability to engage in collective action, to function as a democracy, to make decisions
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.640]   and trust is the foundation of that as well.
