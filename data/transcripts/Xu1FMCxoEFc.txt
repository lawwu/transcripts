[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.040]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.100]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.760]   This month, we're talking all about disorders of the mind,
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.240]   things like depression, attention deficit disorders,
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.920]   eating disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.080]   During the course of this month,
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.220]   we are going to discuss the psychological
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.320]   and biological underpinnings of mood disorders of all kinds.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.940]   You'll learn a lot of science.
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.160]   You'll also learn a lot about the various treatments
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.720]   that exist and that are in development
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.120]   for these various mood disorders.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.520]   We will talk about behavioral tools,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.280]   things like exercise, meditation, breath work,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.080]   but also prescription drugs, supplements,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.420]   and novel compounds that are now being tested
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.400]   in various clinical trials.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.460]   Across the month, I think you'll start to realize
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.800]   that there are common pathways
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.360]   underlying many mood disorders.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.120]   In fact, mood disorders that look quite different
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.040]   from one another often depend on the action
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.260]   of the same neurochemicals or neural circuits
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.920]   in the brain and body.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.420]   That actually should be a point of great relief
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.160]   because what it means is that by understanding the biology
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.480]   of one mood disorder or understanding how one treatment
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.800]   or behavioral intervention can impact a mood disorder,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   we gain insight into other mood disorders as well.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.640]   As always, we will discuss science and science-related tools
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.200]   that people could implement should they choose.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.660]   Before we dive into today's topic,
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.840]   I'd like to discuss a very particular set
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.920]   of scientific findings that relate to today's topic
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.240]   and that are important for understanding all mood disorders
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.240]   and all states of motivation, happiness, and sadness,
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.240]   as well as depression.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.020]   Basically, I'm going to paraphrase a brief segment
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.840]   of my discussion with Dr. Anna Lemke,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.600]   who I sat down with to discuss addiction
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.660]   and the biological basis of addiction
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.920]   and addiction treatment.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.720]   A very important aspect of that discussion
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.120]   was when Dr. Lemke described the pleasure-pain balance,
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.880]   literally the circuits in our brains
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.360]   that control our sense of pleasure and pain,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.320]   and ultimately whether or not we remain happy
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.340]   in our pursuit of pleasure or not.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.440]   This is an absolutely crucial aspect
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.100]   to the way that we function in everyday life
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.820]   and especially under conditions of mood disorders.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.460]   The pathway that she was describing
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.500]   is the so-called pleasure system.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.460]   However, what most people don't realize
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.380]   is that the pleasure system is also directly associated with
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.500]   and in fact is the very same system
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.100]   that modulates mental or psychological anguish and pain.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.620]   Essentially, what she described
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.620]   is that whenever we pursue something that we think
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.500]   will bring us pleasure,
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.180]   and that could be anything that we think
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.420]   will bring us pleasure, from food to video games, to sex,
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.280]   to a particular job or goal, short-term or long-term,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   that we experience release of the neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.060]   Now, dopamine is associated
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.480]   with increased levels of motivation and drive.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.000]   It is not the molecule of reward.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.560]   It is the molecule of craving, motivation, and drive.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.480]   However, as Dr. Lemke pointed out,
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.540]   when we are in pursuit of something,
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.680]   there is a release of dopamine in our brain.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.340]   That makes us feel motivated,
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.820]   and in general, it makes us feel good.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.160]   But very shortly thereafter,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.000]   and beneath our conscious awareness,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.460]   there is a tilt of the pleasure-pain balance in the brain,
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.260]   literally a shift in the neural circuits
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.180]   that underlie pleasure and pain,
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.340]   such that every bit of pleasure or pleasure seeking
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.480]   that causes release of dopamine
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.820]   will be balanced out by a little bit of pain.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.320]   And we don't experience this as physical pain,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.460]   at least not at first.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.060]   We experience it as craving for more
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.380]   of the thing that brought us pleasure.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.740]   Now, that sounds pretty good.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.560]   You get pleasure,
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.820]   and then you get a little bit of pain to balance it out.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.740]   It's subconscious,
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.340]   and you experience it as the desire
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.300]   to seek out more pleasure.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.580]   However, it's actually more diabolical than that,
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.080]   and we really need to keep an eye on this
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.040]   if we are to remain happy,
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.620]   if we are to remain in pursuit of our goals.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.260]   The crucial thing to understand
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.220]   is that if we remain in constant pursuit of pleasure,
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.420]   the pain side of the balance tips
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.940]   so that each time we are in pursuit
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.300]   of that pleasureful thing, activity or substance,
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.420]   we are going to experience,
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.460]   we literally achieve less dopamine release
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.080]   each subsequent time.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.820]   So we get less pleasure,
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.380]   and the amount of craving increases.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.020]   Now, after a certain point or threshold,
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.740]   we call that addiction.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.700]   And the way to reset the balance,
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.540]   and this is very important,
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.460]   the way to reset the balance
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.240]   is actually to enter into states
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.280]   in which we are not in pursuit of pleasure,
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.760]   to literally enter states in which we are bored,
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.740]   maybe even a little bored and anxious,
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.640]   and that resets the pleasure-pain balance
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.900]   so that we can return to our pursuit of pleasure
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.880]   in a way that's healthy and that in an ongoing way
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.080]   won't lead to this over-tipping
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.140]   or this increase in the amount of pain or addiction.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.260]   So this is very important.
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.420]   And if this seemed vague, what this means is
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.420]   we should always be cautious of any state of mind or body
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.820]   or any pursuit that leads to very large increases
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.820]   in dopamine.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.200]   And if it does, we should be very careful
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.980]   to not pursue that repeatedly over time.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.060]   During today's episode, I'm going to give an example,
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.820]   a real-life example of a discussion that I've been in
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.500]   with a young man who's 21 years old
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.480]   who's dealing with a disruption
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.320]   in this pleasure-pain balance.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.160]   He is essentially depressed.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.660]   And he's depressed because of his ongoing pursuit
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.840]   of a particular activity that initially led
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.900]   to a lot of dopamine, but over time has led
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.360]   to less and less dopamine and more and more
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.380]   of this pain side of the balance.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.140]   We could call him addicted to that particular activity.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.700]   Whether or not he's addicted by clinical standards or not
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.100]   really isn't important.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.540]   What is important is that he experiences this as depression,
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.500]   as low affect as it's called, or anhedonia,
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.980]   an inability to experience pleasure from that thing
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.540]   or from anything else.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.180]   And he's currently undergoing treatment
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.120]   through a rebalancing of this pleasure-pain pathway.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.980]   So while I can't reveal his identity to you,
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.220]   that wouldn't be appropriate.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.900]   He did give me permission to reveal the general architecture
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.060]   of what he's coping with.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.360]   And I spent some hours with him on the phone this week,
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.740]   talking to him, as well as to the various people
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.140]   that he's working with to really understand
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.180]   what's going on here.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.580]   Because I think it can illustrate the relationship
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.900]   between dopamine, pleasure, and pain for sake of addiction,
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.620]   but also for understanding how to avoid depressive states,
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.500]   how to remove ourselves from depressive states.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.940]   And as you'll see today, as we discussed depression,
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.420]   many of the molecules and neural pathways
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.460]   and biological mechanisms that we know can be used
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.860]   to counter depression,
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.420]   feed back onto this pleasure-pain balance.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.780]   Before we begin, I'd like to say that this podcast
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.740]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.860]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.620]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.580]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.720]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.620]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.380]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.820]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.420]   that analyzes data from blood and DNA
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.980]   to help you better understand your body
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.980]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.780]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.400]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.780]   that impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.980]   can only be detected from a quality blood test.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.100]   The problem with most blood tests, however,
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.740]   is that you get information back about hormone levels,
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.060]   metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.500]   but you don't really know what to do with that information.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.200]   Some things might be flagged as too high or too low,
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.160]   but really interpreting those data and taking action
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.500]   to bring those numbers into the ranges that you want
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.580]   is what it's really about.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.820]   And InsideTracker makes all that very easy.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.100]   They have a platform, it's a dashboard
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.860]   that will tell you, for instance,
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.300]   what sorts of dietary changes or supplementation changes
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.040]   or exercise changes will help you bring various hormones,
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.300]   metabolic factors, and other factors
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.700]   into the ranges that are right for you.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.300]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.580]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.420]   And if you do that,
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.300]   you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.860]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.500]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.860]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.380]   I've been using Athletic Greens since way back in 2012.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.980]   And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.700]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.620]   and that I still take Athletic Greens
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.300]   is that it really covers all of my foundational
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.500]   nutrient and micronutrient needs.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.120]   It has vitamins, minerals,
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.820]   and the thing that's especially important to me these days
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.620]   is the probiotics,
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.260]   because there are so many data
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.640]   that show that having a healthy gut microbiome
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.220]   is vital to having a healthy immune system
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.760]   and for healthy gut brain access.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.700]   Literally the functioning of your brain,
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.400]   your mood, various aspects of brain inflammation
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.200]   or limiting brain inflammation
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.740]   are facilitated by having a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.140]   And that's facilitated by getting the proper probiotics.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.660]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.960]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.000]   If you do that, you can claim their special offer.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.180]   The special offer is five free travel packs,
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.520]   which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.480]   while you're on the road or in the car,
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.140]   and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.680]   Vitamin D3K2 have been shown to have
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.900]   a number of different positive health effects
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.620]   on hormones, on cardiovascular health, and so on.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.340]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.060]   to claim their special offer.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.420]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Belcampo.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.140]   Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.880]   that raises organic, grass-fed,
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.620]   and finished certified humane meats.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.040]   I don't eat a lot of meat.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.140]   Typically my diet regime is one in which
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.140]   I fast until about noon.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.380]   And then I have a lunch which is fairly low carb.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.640]   So I'll have some piece of meat or chicken or fish
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.820]   and some salad typically.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.660]   And then in the evening
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.920]   is when I tend to emphasize carbohydrates.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.140]   That helps me be really alert during the day
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.300]   and sleep well at night.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.520]   When I do eat meat,
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.160]   I insist that the meat be of the very highest quality
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.580]   and that it is sourced in humane ways.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.020]   Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.120]   and seasonal grasses,
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.320]   and that results in meat that is higher in nutrients
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.460]   and healthy fats.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.640]   There are now a lot of data pointing to the fact
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.020]   that high levels of omega-3 fatty acids
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.980]   are vital for mood, for cardiovascular health,
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.060]   and various aspects of maintaining
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.340]   what's called a healthy inflammatome.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.180]   The various things in our brain and body
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.660]   that maintain a healthy inflammation response,
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.780]   but one that doesn't go out of whack or get unchecked
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.280]   in any way that is detrimental to us.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.860]   If you'd like to try Belcampo,

[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.040]   Today, we're discussing depression.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.760]   In particular, we're going to talk about major depression.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.380]   The phrase major depression is used to distinguish
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.460]   one form of depression from the other,
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.760]   the other one being bipolar depression.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.260]   Bipolar depression, sometimes called bipolar disorder,
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.940]   is really characterized by manic highs,
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.960]   so where people aren't sleeping
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.900]   and they're talking very fast and they're buying things
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.540]   and pursuing resources that they can't afford.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.620]   They're starting relationships left and right.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.620]   They're manic, followed by periods of crashes,
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.340]   of feeling very low, lethargic, and so on.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.520]   Bipolar depression is an absolutely crucial thing
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.660]   for us to discuss,
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.480]   and therefore, we are going to have
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.900]   an entire separate episode related to bipolar depression.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.840]   Today, we're going to talk about major depression,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.400]   also sometimes called unipolar depression,
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.620]   just because it doesn't have the highs and lows.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.980]   It's more characterized by the lows.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.640]   We're going to talk about the biology, the psychology,
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.740]   and the various treatments,
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.640]   behavioral, drugs, supplementation, diet, exercise,
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.480]   all of that.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.360]   Before we go forward into the material,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.780]   I just want to emphasize that any discussion
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.840]   about mood disorders carries with it
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.080]   a particular sensitivity,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.400]   and that sensitivity is one related to self-diagnosis.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.540]   Today's episode, and indeed in the future episodes
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.420]   for this month on mood disorders,
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.500]   you're going to hear very symptomologies
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.020]   that are used to diagnose and characterize these disorders.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.560]   If you recognize some of these symptomologies in yourself
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.340]   or in others that you know,
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.220]   that's an important thing to take note of.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.300]   However, accurate diagnosis really should be done
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.340]   by a qualified healthcare professional.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.380]   So at once I'm saying, keep your eyes and your ears up
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.340]   for things that sound familiar to you
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.460]   that might be of concern.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.460]   And at the same time, I'm saying,
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.620]   don't necessarily leap to conclusions.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.100]   Take those flags of concern if they're there
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.460]   and bring them to a qualified healthcare professional,
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.960]   and they'll be able to properly diagnose you
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.780]   as having a particular mood disorder
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.260]   or diagnose somebody as having a particular mood disorder
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.900]   or not, and that's an essential step.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.300]   I don't say this to protect us,
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.600]   I say this really to protect you.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.660]   Okay, let's have a fact-based discussion about depression.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.720]   And I promise you that where we don't know
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.060]   certain things about depression,
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.700]   I will be clear to tell you.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.980]   In fact, we are going to talk about
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.540]   some treatments for depression
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.060]   that are looking very promising
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.920]   and that right now are actually being used more and more.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.300]   And from my read of the mechanistic literature,
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.900]   we're still a bit in the dark as to how these work.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.540]   That's actually a common theme of medicine.
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.540]   Many times there are treatments that seem promising
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.620]   or that look really terrific,
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.500]   and there isn't a lot of understanding about mechanism.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.360]   However, any good discussion about neuroscience
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.060]   and in particular about mood disorders
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.340]   has to get into mechanism.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.360]   So we're going to do that.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.020]   And in doing that, we're going to frame the discussion
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.200]   for the tools of how to keep depression at bay
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.420]   and how to deal with it
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.020]   if you happen to find yourself depressed
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.980]   or if you know somebody else who's depressed.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.500]   What is this thing we call depression?
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.400]   Well, as I mentioned before,
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.780]   it has two forms, bipolar depression,
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.340]   which we're not talking about today,
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.020]   and major depression,
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.100]   also called unipolar depression is the other.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.680]   Major depression impacts 5% of the population.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.140]   That is an enormous number.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.800]   That means if you're in a class of 100 people,
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.060]   five of them are dealing with major depression
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.160]   or have at some point.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.620]   Look around you in any environment
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.540]   and you can be sure that a good portion of the people
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.880]   that you're surrounded by is impacted by depression
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.260]   or will be at some point.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.140]   So this is something we really have to take seriously
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.700]   and that we want to understand.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.460]   It is the number four cause of disability.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.400]   A lot of people miss work, miss school,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.300]   and before then likely perform poorly in work or school
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.720]   due to major depression.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.320]   Now, there's a very serious challenge
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.660]   in having a discussion about depression,
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.480]   and it relates directly to the challenges
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.040]   in diagnosing depression.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.800]   Earlier, I did an episode with Dr. Carl Deisseroth,
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.440]   who is indeed a medical doctor and a PhD,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.280]   he's a psychiatrist,
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.720]   and he made a very important point,
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.880]   which is that the field of psychiatry and psychology
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.320]   are confronted with a challenge,
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.440]   which is they're trying to understand what's going on
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.280]   within the stuff that's in our brains,
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.440]   that's deep to our skulls.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.640]   We don't have access to that without brain imaging
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.520]   and electrodes and things like that.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.880]   Someone just comes into the office
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.520]   and the dissection tool for depression, so to speak,
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.520]   is language.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.280]   In order to determine if somebody has depression or not,
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.660]   we have to use language, how they talk about things,
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.280]   also how they carry their body,
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.620]   also some general patterns of health.
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.840]   So let's talk about depression
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.520]   the way that clinicians talk about depression,
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.560]   because one of the issues is that we use the word depression
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.780]   loosely, a lot of people say, oh, you know, I'm so depressed,
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.240]   I didn't get this job, or I'm so depressed,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.920]   I just, I don't know, I had a really rough week,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.240]   or I'm exhausted, I'm so depressed, or I'm so depressed,
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.600]   I thought I was going to go on vacation
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.640]   and then they canceled the flight, okay?
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.240]   That is not clinical depression,
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.320]   that's called being bummed out, being sad or disappointed.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.760]   Now that person might be depressed,
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.040]   but clinical depression
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.880]   actually has some very specific criteria
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.420]   and those criteria are mainly characterized
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.160]   by the presence of certain things
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.580]   and the absence of a few particular things.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.520]   So let's talk about the things that are present
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.480]   in somebody that has major depression.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.900]   First of all, there tends to be a lot of grief,
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.560]   there tends to be a lot of sadness, that's no surprise.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.140]   The threshold to cry is often a signature of depression.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.160]   Now that doesn't mean that if you cry easily
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.140]   that you're depressed, some people cry more easily
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.920]   than others, but if you're somebody
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.580]   who typically didn't cry easily
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.240]   and suddenly you find yourself crying very easily,
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.440]   that could be a sign of depression,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.940]   and I want to emphasize could.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.360]   There's also this thing that we call anhedonia,
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.440]   a general lack of ability to enjoy things,
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.080]   things that typically or previously we enjoyed,
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.000]   things like food, things like sex, things like exercise,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   things like social gatherings,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.160]   a kind of lack of enjoyment from those things.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.320]   Sometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.820]   and sometimes it's just flat, it's just kind of neutral.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.940]   It doesn't feel good because there's nothing there,
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:54.400]   it's like bland food, it's like these experiences
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.500]   are analogous to biting into your favorite article of food,
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.980]   and it just not tasting very good,
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.700]   it just doesn't taste like anything at all,
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.960]   and that's a common symptom of major depression.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.160]   The other one is guilt.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.120]   Oftentimes people with depression will feel very guilty
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.800]   about things they have done in the past
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.060]   or they'll just generally feel badly about themselves,
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.480]   and we're going to talk about this
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.320]   because it relates to some of the more serious symptomology
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.640]   seen in depression sometimes,
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.100]   things like self-harm, mutilation, or even suicide,
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.600]   but for the time being, we want to frame up anhedonia,
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.840]   this lack of ability to achieve or experience pleasure,
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.680]   a kind of a flat affect as it's called,
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.500]   sometimes even delusional thinking,
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.080]   negative delusional thinking,
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   and in particular, anti-self confabulation.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.680]   What is anti-self confabulation?
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.160]   Well, first of all, confabulation is an incredible aspect
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.220]   of our mind and our nervous system.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.480]   You sometimes see other forms of confabulation
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.440]   in people who have memory deficits,
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.240]   either because they have brain damage
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.200]   or they have age-related dementia.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.700]   A good example of this would be
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.760]   someone with age-related dementia
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.800]   sometimes will find themselves in a location in the house
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.620]   and not know how they got there.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.320]   And if you ask them, oh, what are you doing here?
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.280]   They will create these elaborate stories.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.860]   Oh, you know, I was thinking about going to shopping today,
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.640]   and I was going to take the bus, and then I was going to do,
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.000]   they create these elaborate stories, they confabulate,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.080]   and yet that person hasn't left the house in weeks,
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.740]   and that person doesn't have a driver's license.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.640]   And so they're really just creating this stuff.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.720]   They're not lying to get out of anything.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.560]   They're confabulating.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.360]   It's as if a brain circuit that writes stories
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.680]   just starts generating content.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.740]   In major depression,
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.600]   there's often a state of delusional anti-self confabulation
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.900]   where the confabulations are not directly
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.160]   or completely linked to reality,
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.840]   but they are ones that make the self,
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.520]   the person describing them,
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.920]   seem sick or in some way not well.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.200]   A good example would be somebody
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.780]   who experiences a physical injury, perhaps.
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.900]   Maybe they break their ankle, maybe it's an athlete,
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.240]   and they also happen to become depressed.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.080]   And you'll talk to them.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.040]   You'll say, how are things going?
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.880]   How's your rehab?
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.720]   And they'll go, oh, it's okay.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.140]   And I don't know, I'm just,
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.560]   I feel like I'm getting weaker and weaker by the day.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.880]   I'm just not performing well.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.720]   And then you'll talk to the person that they're working with,
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.120]   their kinesiologist or whoever the physical therapist is,
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.040]   and they'll say, no, they're actually really improving.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.120]   And I tell them they're improving,
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.420]   but somehow they're not.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.800]   They're not seeing that improvement.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.620]   They're not registering that improvement.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.480]   You notice that sometimes it's subtle
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.720]   and sometimes it's severe, but they'll start confabulating.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.400]   You'll say, I actually heard you're doing much better.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.440]   You're getting better.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.320]   You're taking multiple trips around the building now
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.080]   before you could barely get out of bed.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.760]   And they'll say, yeah, well, basically,
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.520]   they changed some things about the parking lot
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.040]   that make it easier to move around, so it's not really me.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.400]   And these aren't people that are just explaining away
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   their accomplishments
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.000]   'cause they're trying to brush off praise.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.740]   They are viewing themselves and they're confabulating
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.760]   according to a view that is very self-deprecating
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.500]   to the point where it doesn't match up with reality.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.920]   It's not what other people see,
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.500]   and it's actually not matched up with reality.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.780]   And that's a symptom of depression
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.080]   that I think we don't often think about
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.000]   or conceptualize enough.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.640]   So it's not just telling people, oh yeah,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.760]   it's not as good as it seems, everything's bad.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.200]   These people really believe that
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.320]   and it becomes disconnected from reality.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.380]   So it's as if they're sort of sinking into a pit
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.980]   and they're losing touch with the realities of the world,
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.960]   including data about themselves,
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.380]   their ability to move and get around.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.920]   For example, in the particular instance
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.960]   that I used as an example, but there are others as well.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.360]   The other common symptomology of major depression
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.680]   is what they call vegetative symptoms, okay?
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.240]   So vegetative symptoms are symptoms that occur
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.040]   without any thinking, without any doing,
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.440]   or without any confabulation.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.080]   These are things that are related to our core physiology.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.080]   The word vegetative, you might know it sounds like vegetable,
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.520]   it actually relates to a system in the body
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.160]   that nowadays is more commonly called
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.480]   the autonomic nervous system.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.600]   The vegetative nervous system
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.320]   and the autonomic nervous system,
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.040]   historically were considered sort of one in the same.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.840]   And it relates to things like the stress response
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.720]   or to our ability to sleep.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.480]   So vegetative symptoms be things like
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.400]   constantly being exhausted.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.720]   The person just feels exhausted.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.400]   It's not because they exercise too much.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.640]   It's not necessarily because of a life event, it could be,
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.440]   but they're just worn out.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.080]   They don't have the energy they once had.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.180]   So it's not in their heads.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.840]   It's probably, and now I think we have good data
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.480]   to support the fact that there's something off.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.540]   Something is disrupted in the autonomic
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.560]   or so-called vegetative nervous system.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.400]   And one of the most common symptoms
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.220]   of people with major depression,
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.560]   one of the signs of major depression is early waking
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.560]   and not being able to fall back asleep
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.820]   despite being exhausted.
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.220]   So waking up at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. or 5 a.m.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.220]   just spontaneously and not being able to go back to sleep.
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.900]   I want to emphasize that that could happen
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.860]   for other reasons as well,
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.900]   but it is a common symptom or warning sign
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.520]   of major depression.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.960]   So let's talk more about sleep and depression.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.460]   It's well known that the architecture of sleep
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.320]   is disrupted in depression.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.660]   What's the architecture of sleep?
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.100]   I've done entire episodes about this,
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.340]   but very briefly in two sentences,
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.140]   although they'll probably be run on sentences,
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.320]   early in the night, you tend to have slow wave sleep
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.620]   more than REM sleep or rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.500]   As the night goes on,
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.860]   you tend to have more rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.380]   That architecture of slow wave sleep
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.840]   preceding rapid eye movement sleep
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.840]   is radically disrupted in major depression.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.220]   In addition, the pattern of activity in the brain
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.180]   during particular phases of sleep is disrupted.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.420]   Now this is during sleep.
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.460]   So this can't be that people are creating
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.640]   this situation for themselves.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.940]   These are real physiological signs
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.780]   that something is off in this so-called autonomic
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.880]   or vegetative nervous system.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.160]   And then there are some other things
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.780]   that relate to the autonomic nervous system,
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.560]   but that we normally think of as more voluntary in nature.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.180]   And these are things like decreased appetite.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.180]   So you could imagine that one could have decreased appetite
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.660]   because of the anhedonia, the lack of pleasure from food.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.620]   If you don't enjoy food, then you might be less motivated
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.660]   to eat it, that makes sense.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.500]   As well, because of these disruptions
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.260]   in the autonomic nervous system,
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.540]   these vegetative symptoms as they're called,
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.740]   you can imagine that someone would have decreased appetite
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.320]   because some of the hormones associated with appetite,
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.820]   hypocretinorexin and things of that sort,
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.460]   ghrelin, that those will be disrupted.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.660]   And if those names of hypocretinorexin and ghrelin
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.820]   don't make any sense to you, don't worry about it.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.180]   What those are just hormones that impact when we eat,
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.140]   when we feel hungry and when we crave food more,
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.620]   as well as when we feel full,
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.460]   we have enough so-called satiety.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.700]   If you want to learn more about those,
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.700]   we did entire episodes on eating and metabolism.
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.940]   So you can see that the symptomology of major depression
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.800]   impacts us at multiple levels.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.160]   There's the conscious level of how excited we are generally.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.340]   Well, that's reduced.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.580]   There's grief, there's guilt, there's crying,
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.640]   but then there's also these vegetative things.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.860]   There's disruptions in sleep,
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.860]   which of course make everything more challenging
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.260]   when we're awake, we know that.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.020]   Sleep is so vital for resetting.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.940]   You're waking up early, you can't get back to sleep.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.860]   That's going to adjust your affect,
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.540]   your emotions in negative ways, we know this.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.940]   And appetite is off.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.500]   And there are hormones that get disrupted.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.660]   So cortisol levels are increased.
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.620]   In particular, there's a signature pattern of depression
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.060]   whereby cortisol, the stress hormone that normally
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.740]   is released in a healthy way
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.900]   only in the early part of the day
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.740]   is shifted to late in the day.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.500]   In fact, a 9 p.m. peak in cortisol
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.980]   is one of the physiological signatures
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.820]   of depressive like states.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.440]   It's not the only one, but it is an important one.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.520]   So there are a lot of things going on in major depression.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.000]   And by now you're probably thinking,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.180]   oh goodness, this is dreadful.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.500]   Like there's all this terrible stuff.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.480]   And indeed it is terrible.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.420]   It is a terrible thing to find oneself
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.660]   in a mode where things feel sad, you feel guilty,
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.020]   you're exhausted.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.480]   And oftentimes there's also an association
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.620]   with the anxiety system.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.160]   So just because people are exhausted and lethargic
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.320]   and they don't enjoy things doesn't necessarily mean
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.320]   that there's an absence of anxiety.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.660]   There can also be a lot of anxiety
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.940]   about what's going to happen to me.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.140]   Am I going to be able to achieve my goals in life?
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.540]   Will I ever get out of this state?
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.420]   And so things really start to layer on.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.580]   And as if this sounds depressing to you,
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.380]   it is indeed depressing.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.700]   This is really the place that many people find themselves.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.520]   And it's a pit that they just don't know
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.940]   how to climb out of.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.700]   So let's just take a few minutes
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.380]   and talk about some of the underlying biology
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.020]   that creates this cloud
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.940]   or this constellation of symptomology.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.380]   I think that's really important to do
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.180]   because if we want to understand the various treatments,
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.660]   how they work and why they work and how to implement them,
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.260]   we have to understand some of the underlying biology.
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.700]   So let's spend a few minutes talking
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.740]   about the biology of depression.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.460]   What's known, what's not known.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.800]   Because in doing that,
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.860]   I think you'll get a much clearer picture
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.020]   about why certain tools work to relieve depression
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.700]   and why others might not.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.040]   So one of the most important early findings
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.180]   in the search for a biological basis of depression
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.960]   was this finding that there are drugs
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.840]   that relieve some of the symptoms of depression.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.520]   Those drugs generally fall into three major categories,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.320]   but the first set of ones that were discovered
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.780]   were the so-called tricyclic antidepressants
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.780]   and the MAO inhibitors, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.040]   You don't need to understand that nomenclature,
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.600]   but I'm going to give you a little bit of detail
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.480]   so that if you want to understand it, you can.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.920]   Most of this work took place in the late 1950s
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.320]   and in the 1960s and continued well until the 1980s
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.880]   when new classes of drugs were discovered.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.780]   And these tricyclic antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:23.440]   largely worked by increasing levels of norepinephrine
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.100]   in the brain, as well as in the body in some cases.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.440]   And they were discovered
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.320]   through a kind of odd set of circumstances.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.820]   We don't have time to go into all the history,
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.120]   but suffice to say that they were discovered
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.760]   because of the exploration for drugs
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.320]   that alter blood pressure.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.920]   Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.200]   and drugs that lower blood pressure,
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.440]   reduce levels of norepinephrine.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.280]   And that in many cases was shown to lead to depression
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.240]   or depressive-like symptoms.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.720]   And so these drugs, these tricyclic drugs
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.740]   and the MAO inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine.
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.800]   And frankly, they do quite a good job of relieving some,
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.360]   if not all of the symptoms of major depression.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.160]   However, they carry with them many side effects.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.540]   Some of those side effects are side effects
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.960]   related to blood pressure itself.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.600]   By increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine as it's called,
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.680]   you raise blood pressure.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.060]   That can be dangerous.
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.600]   That can be uncomfortable.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.000]   But they also have a lot of other side effects.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.680]   The reason they have other side effects
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.180]   is because they impact systems in the brain and in the body
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:35.040]   that impact things like libido, appetite, digestion,
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.280]   and others, and we'll talk about each of those in sequence.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.160]   Okay, so the experience that clinicians had
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.140]   of observing some relief for depression
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.120]   with the tricyclic antidepressants
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.780]   and with MAO inhibitors was terrific,
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.400]   but there were all these side effects,
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.440]   side effects that people really did not like.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.360]   They didn't like these drugs at all.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.920]   A lot of people would get dry mouth.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.120]   I mentioned the low libido.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.000]   They'd have sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.480]   They made some people so uncomfortable
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.980]   that they preferred not to take them,
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.840]   even though when they didn't take them,
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.720]   they had a worsening or a maintenance
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.160]   of their depressive symptoms.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.840]   A decade or so later, there was the discovery
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.480]   of the so-called pleasure pathways in the brain.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.380]   These are pathways, literally groups of neurons
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.520]   that reside in different locations in the brain,
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.580]   but connect to one another.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.880]   So it's a circuit.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:27.880]   And when you stimulate these neurons with certain behaviors
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.680]   or with electrical stimulation in an experiment,
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.640]   believe it or not, that's been done
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.620]   in both animals and humans.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.660]   Animals and humans become very, very motivated
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.680]   to get more stimulation of these pathways.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.280]   So this pleasure pathway or these circuits for pleasure
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.320]   are very what we call reinforcing.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:51.600]   In fact, animals and humans will work hard
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.040]   to get stimulation of these brain areas
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.600]   even more than they will work to obtain sex, drugs,
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.200]   or even if they are addicted to a particular drug
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.840]   and they are in a state of withdrawal,
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.140]   the ultimate state of craving, if given a choice,
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.620]   a person or an animal will select to have stimulation
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.060]   of this pleasure pathway instead of the drug itself.
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.060]   And that is a major and significant finding.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.820]   This pleasure pathway, as it's sometimes called,
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.060]   involves areas like the nucleus accumbens
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.920]   and the ventral tegmental area.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.660]   These are areas of the brain that are rich with neurons
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.360]   that make dopamine.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.000]   And if you think to the symptoms of depression,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.760]   of anhedonia, lack of pleasure,
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.340]   a lack of ability to experience pleasure,
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.440]   well, that was a smoking gun that there's something wrong
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.300]   with the dopamine pathway in depression.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.260]   And indeed that's the case.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.640]   So it's not just norepinephrine,
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.960]   it's also the dopamine or pleasure pathway
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.640]   is somehow disrupted.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.360]   And then in the 1980s,
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.000]   there was the discovery of the so-called SSRIs.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.240]   Most people are now familiar with the SSRIs,
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.400]   the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.980]   The SSRIs worked by distinct mechanisms
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:06.060]   from the tricyclic antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.160]   As their name suggests, SSRI,
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.020]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:16.020]   prevent serotonin from being wiped up from the synapse
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.340]   after two neurons talk to one another.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.920]   Well, here's some very basic neurobiology 101.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.560]   If you don't know any neurobiology,
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.480]   you're going to know some in about 15 seconds.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.560]   Neurons communicate with one another
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.520]   by spitting out chemicals into the little gap between them.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.700]   The little gap between them is called the synapse
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.320]   or by the Brits, the synapse.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.840]   Those chemicals bind to the neuron on the opposite side
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.200]   and cause changes in the electrical activity
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.280]   of that neuron on the other side of the synapse.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.040]   Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.720]   or more specifically, it's a neuromodulator.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.520]   It can change the activity of large groups of neurons
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.900]   in very meaningful ways.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.400]   Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor means
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.040]   when a person takes this drug,
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.160]   some of those drugs include things like Prozac or Zoloft,
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.320]   the more typical names or more generic names
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.100]   are things like fluoxetine.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.640]   When people take those,
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.640]   more serotonin hangs out in the synapse
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.880]   and is able to be taken up by the neuron
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.540]   on the opposite side
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.320]   because of this selective reuptake inhibition.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.700]   It prevents the clearance of serotonin from the synapse
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.500]   and thereby more serotonin can have an effect.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.240]   So SSRIs don't increase the total amount of serotonin
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.180]   in the brain.
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.900]   They change how effective the serotonin
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.020]   that's already in the brain is
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.860]   at changing the activity of neurons, okay?
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.760]   So they don't increase serotonin.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.560]   They increase the efficacy or the function of serotonin
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.540]   in the way that I just described.
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.000]   So that was more than 15 seconds,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.860]   but now you understand how SSRIs work.
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.200]   And I wouldn't be talking about SSRIs
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.100]   if they didn't in fact work.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.820]   Yes, there are many problems with SSRIs.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.900]   They do carry certain side effects in many individuals.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:11.240]   Also about a third of people that take SSRIs
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.020]   don't derive any benefit.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.300]   It doesn't relieve their symptoms of depression.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.080]   However, for the other two thirds,
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.860]   there's often a relief of some,
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.480]   if not all of the symptoms of major depression.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.500]   The problem is the side effects that accompany those SSRIs.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.740]   And so these days, SSRIs are a complicated topic.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.780]   It's sort of what I would call a barbed wire topic
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.860]   because we often hear about all the problems with them,
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.300]   but these drugs also have saved a lot of lives.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.280]   They've also improved a lot of lives.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.660]   The issue is that they tend to have varying effects
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.580]   on different individuals
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.820]   and sometimes varying effects over time.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.160]   So they'll work for a while,
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.240]   then they won't work for a while.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.620]   There are also a lot of mysteries about the SSRIs
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.700]   and those mysteries bother people.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.100]   What mysteries am I referring to?
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:59.300]   Well, SSRIs increase the amount of serotonin
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.540]   or more specifically,
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.220]   they increase the efficacy of serotonin at the synapse.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.860]   That happens immediately
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.980]   or very soon after people start taking SSRIs,
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.700]   but people generally don't start experiencing any relief
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.300]   from their symptoms of depression
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.060]   if they're going to experience them at all
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.000]   until about two weeks after they start taking these drugs.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.380]   So there's something going on there that's not clear.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.780]   One idea is that the SSRIs
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.620]   actually can improve symptoms of depression
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.340]   or even remove symptoms of depression
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.820]   through so-called neuroplasticity
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.900]   by changing the way that neural circuits function.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.820]   And there are many studies on this,
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.200]   but the main categories of studies on SSRIs
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.020]   that relate to neuroplasticity fall into two camps.
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.400]   One is the ways in which SSRIs might,
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.760]   and I want to emphasize might,
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.180]   be able to trigger the production of more neurons
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.200]   in the brain, in particular areas of the hippocampus
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.460]   called the dentate gyrus and others that impact memory.
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.460]   This is important and we're going to come back to memory.
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.540]   The other is that the SSRIs have been shown
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.900]   in various scientific studies
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.500]   to reopen critical periods of plasticity.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.500]   I'll just briefly describe one of those studies.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.380]   It was a study done by Lumberto Maffei's group in Pisa
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.820]   that explored brain plasticity
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.960]   that's known to be present in young animals
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.440]   and disappear in older animals.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.140]   And this is also true in humans.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.980]   Younger humans have a far more plastic brain.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.740]   It can change in many more ways,
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.180]   more easily than can the older brain.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.340]   And what they showed was that fluoxetine, Prozac,
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.980]   given to adult animals,
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.860]   can reopen this incredible period of plasticity.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.580]   It can allow more plasticity to occur.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.420]   That was interesting.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.820]   I mean, it's purely through increases
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.900]   in serotonin transmission.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.700]   And there are other studies showing
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.000]   that fluoxetine can increase the number of new neurons
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.220]   that are born into the adult brain, so-called neurogenesis,
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.300]   the production of new neurons.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.340]   So it's very clear that there are at least
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.700]   three major chemical systems in the brain,
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.620]   norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:08.980]   that relate to and can adjust the symptoms of depression.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.120]   And those actually can be divided into separate categories.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.940]   So for instance, epinephrine or norepinephrine
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:19.300]   is thought to relate to the so-called psychomotor defects,
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.380]   sometimes called psychomotor retardation.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.680]   This is the lethargy.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.060]   This is the exhaustion.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.740]   This is the inability to get out of bed in the morning.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.300]   Dopamine is thought to relate to the anhedonia,
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.700]   or I should say lack of dopamine in depressive patients
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.920]   is thought to lead to the anhedonia,
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.360]   the lack of ability to experience pleasure.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:44.360]   And serotonin is thought to relate to the grief, the guilt,
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.820]   some of the more cognitive
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.140]   or more emotional aspects of depression.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.740]   So we've got the norepinephrine system
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.920]   related to activity and alertness,
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.100]   the dopamine system relating to motivation, pleasure,
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.520]   and the ability to seek and experience pleasure,
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.340]   and then the serotonin system that's related to grief.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.640]   And unfortunately, brains and organisms don't work
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.380]   in a simple mathematical way where you just say,
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.760]   "Oh, well, this person's experiencing a lot of grief,
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.460]   but they don't have any problems with lethargy,
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.300]   and so let's just boost up their serotonin."
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.300]   On paper, it works,
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.580]   but oftentimes it doesn't work clinically.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.320]   And in another patient,
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.260]   you might get somebody who can't experience pleasure,
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.540]   but they're kind of anxious.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.220]   They don't have any trouble sleeping,
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.820]   but they're just much more anxious
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.140]   and frustrated than they normally are,
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.260]   and they meet the symptoms of depression.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.600]   Well, you might think, "Oh, well, do you just give
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.800]   that person some drug to increase dopamine
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.760]   and everything will be better?"
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.740]   And indeed, in some cases, that's true.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.100]   There are drugs like wellbutrin,
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.660]   which function more specifically on the dopamine system
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.480]   to increase dopamine, and they also increase norepinephrine.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.540]   Many people get great relief from things like wellbutrin.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.460]   They don't really impact the serotonin system so much,
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.860]   and therefore you don't get a lot of the serotoninergic
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.920]   or serotonin-related side effects.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:04.460]   However, some people feel far too anxious on those drugs.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.420]   Some people get addicted to those drugs in a way,
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.940]   because a lot of those drugs that increase dopamine
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.620]   make you want more of those drugs.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.900]   So you start to realize that what makes sense on paper
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.300]   doesn't always make sense clinically,
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.480]   and this is why it's complicated,
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.060]   and a really good psychologist
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.840]   and a really good psychiatrist will work with someone
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.400]   to try and pull and push on these various systems
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.540]   to find the combination of drugs
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.100]   that may be or may not be correct for them.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.180]   There's a fourth aspect of the chemistry of depression
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.500]   that's really important to understand, and that's pain.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.480]   We've talked about pain on this podcast before,
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.920]   but even if you didn't hear the episode
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.900]   on pleasure and pain, I just want to emphasize
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.400]   that pain is something that we experience in our body,
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.100]   no surprise there, an injury, a cut, et cetera,
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.280]   but that we also experience emotional pain,
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.320]   and those systems are linked in very intricate ways.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.120]   There's actually some data showing that pain relievers,
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.880]   Tylenol, aspirin, these sorts of things
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.000]   can help certain people with emotional pain.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.360]   Now, I'm not recommending people run out
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.200]   and take those things for emotional pain,
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.220]   but actually, if you think about that,
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.620]   it shouldn't come as any surprise,
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:09.040]   given the enormous number of people that take painkillers,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.360]   opioids and things like them,
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.240]   to try and relieve their psychological pain,
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.380]   and as we know, those drugs are very, very problematic
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.080]   for many individuals.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.320]   They can help certain individuals,
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.720]   but they are very prone to abuse,
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.040]   and they can induce addiction very easily
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.320]   in a number of people.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.460]   There's a substance that's literally called substance P,
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.880]   the letter P, that's manufactured by neurons
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.720]   in our brain and body,
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.360]   which underlies our sensation of pain,
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.800]   and indeed, substance P inhibitors have been used
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.360]   to treat depression, and in some cases, works.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.920]   A lot of people with depression are hypersensitive to pain,
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.880]   and of course, they could have multiple things going on.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.880]   They could have chronic pain or chronic injury
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.720]   and major depression, so you start to get the constellation
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.880]   of the many things that could happen.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.960]   So that's all I want to say today
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.840]   about the chemistry underlying depression
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.160]   or major depression.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.160]   There's a lot more there,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.600]   but I think if you understand the norepinephrine system
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.560]   and that it relates to some of these things like lethargy,
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.560]   the psychomotor defects, as they're called,
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.960]   dopamine and how it relates to motivation
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.960]   and lack of motivation and lack of dopamine and depression,
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.280]   and serotonin and its relationship to grief,
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.480]   and that low serotonin can lead to extreme grief and shame
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.960]   and higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.880]   a sense of wellbeing and safety
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.680]   and feeling good about oneself.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.040]   If you understand that and you understand
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.400]   that physical pain is somehow involved in certain cases,
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.280]   I think you will know more about depression
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.840]   and its underlying chemistry than most all people out there,
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.840]   and if you'd like to learn more,
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.520]   I invite you to pursue searching those terms further
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.440]   on the internet, and we'll certainly go into them
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.720]   in more depth, but that really sets the stage
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.140]   for where we're headed next.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.780]   So next, I'd like to talk about hormones
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.920]   and how they relate to depression,
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.740]   and I'd also like to talk about stress
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.380]   and how it relates to depression,
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.440]   as well as talk about some of the genetics
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.740]   or the predispositions to depression,
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:03.940]   and for those of you that are thinking,
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.080]   hey, I want the tools, I want to know how to fix depression,
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.740]   I understand the desire for that.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.760]   I will just ask if you hang in here with me
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.060]   a little bit longer, not only will you learn a lot more
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.980]   about how this complicated mood disorder works,
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.240]   some of the more interesting things about it,
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.740]   but it will also position you to get a lot more out
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.480]   of the tools that we will describe.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.400]   You always have the option to skip forward, of course,
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.440]   but I think it's important to understand some
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.540]   of the hormonal and stress-related aspects of depression.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.100]   So let's talk about hormones.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.180]   20% of people that have major depression
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.340]   have low thyroid hormone.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.100]   Thyroid hormone is related to metabolism.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.460]   Oftentimes we think about thyroid as only related
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.240]   to having a fast metabolism,
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.340]   but thyroid is related to all forms of metabolism,
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.800]   including our ability to synthesize new tissues
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.420]   like protein and repair injuries.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.460]   I did a whole episode on thyroid and growth hormone.
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.500]   If you want to check that out,
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.340]   all of that is archived at Hubermanlab.com.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.700]   It's all timestamped, et cetera.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.140]   You can find it on YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.340]   all those places.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.900]   So if you're curious about thyroid hormone
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.000]   and growth hormone, and you want to do the deep dive
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   on those, and you want to learn how to alter their levels
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.640]   using various approaches, check that out.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:20.340]   But 20% of people with major depression are hypothyroidal.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.240]   They don't make enough thyroid.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   And that leads to low energy,
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.300]   low metabolism in the brain and body.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.060]   And there's a condition called Hashimoto's,
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.520]   which is essentially low thyroid output.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.660]   And again, I don't want to get
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.140]   into all the tools related to thyroid.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.980]   Sometimes a psychiatrist will prescribe thyroid medication
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.500]   to increase thyroid output in people that are depressed,
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.520]   and that will work to relieve the symptoms.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.900]   So there isn't necessarily a direct problem
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.000]   with serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.840]   or substance B.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.620]   Sometimes it's a thyroid problem.
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.140]   So there are certain situations or conditions
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.120]   that can impact the thyroid hormone system
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.660]   and make people more susceptible to depression
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.860]   or make a preexisting depression worse.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.340]   And those are things like childbirth.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.780]   So it's well known that women who give birth
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:09.660]   can often undergo what's called postpartum depression.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.780]   It actually comes from the word postpartuition depression.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.660]   They give birth, what's happier,
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.320]   what's more joyful than the birth of a new healthy child,
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.900]   and they will lapse into a depression.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.360]   And that's thought to be hormonally related,
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.960]   either directly to the thyroid system
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.760]   or perhaps to the cortisol system as well.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.460]   We'll talk about cortisol in a moment.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.940]   As well, certain women during certain phases
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.940]   of their menstrual cycle experience symptoms
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.760]   that are very much like clinical depression
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.760]   and oftentimes are diagnosed
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.100]   with clinical depression appropriately.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.700]   And of course, the menstrual cycle is associated
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.040]   with shifts in hormone levels.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:48.620]   As well, menopause and postmenopausal women
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:51.480]   are more susceptible to major depression,
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.780]   regardless of whether or not they've had
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.380]   that major depression earlier in their life.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.160]   So these are things to be on the lookout for
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.180]   and to definitely talk to a doctor and get a blood panel
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.700]   that hopefully includes measures of thyroid hormone
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.660]   and cortisol hormone.
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:03.780]   Why cortisol hormone?
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.220]   Well, more stress is correlated with more bouts
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.820]   of major depression across the lifespan.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.660]   How many bouts?
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:14.380]   Well, it turns out that as you go from having one
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:17.620]   to two to three, well, when you hit four to five bouts
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.700]   of really intense stressful episodes in life,
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.260]   these tend to be long-term stressful episodes,
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.300]   your risk for major depression goes way up.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.860]   So whether or not you have a genetic predisposition
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.980]   to depression or not, one of the best things you can do
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.500]   to try and avoid getting depressed
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.460]   is to learn to control your stress system,
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.880]   to not go from short-term stress,
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.140]   which everybody experiences,
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.220]   we all have short-term stressors,
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.380]   to medium-term stress, to long-term stress,
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.780]   and to not have too many bouts of long-term stress
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.180]   because that probability of getting depressed
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.380]   goes way, way up.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.360]   And this is something I've seen over and over again,
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.900]   not just in my scientific career, but just throughout life,
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.520]   people in all sorts of domains, young and old,
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.260]   I've seen that people will go
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.460]   through a very intense relationship, a breakup,
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.460]   sometimes it's the staying together that's stressful,
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.880]   sometimes it's a graduate school that can be stressful,
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.860]   sometimes it's some other event,
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.580]   and then some months later, they become depressed.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.220]   And that's because the stress system
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.240]   is associated with the release of cortisol.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.720]   The cortisol system can dramatically impact
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.880]   the way that these different neuromodulators,
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.260]   dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin function.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:30.420]   And so there's this kind of latent or longer lasting impact
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.940]   on the systems that impact mood and wellbeing.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.400]   So learning how to control your stress is really key
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.940]   if you're not depressed,
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.980]   or you're somebody that has not lapsed
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.020]   into a depression recently,
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.660]   take control of your stress system.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:46.560]   And we did an entire episode on how to conquer stress,
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.860]   and that involves dealing with stress in the short-term,
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.420]   the medium-term, and in the long-term,
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.620]   and there are a lot of different ways to do that.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.620]   One of the more important reasons
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.160]   for learning how to counter stress
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.000]   in order to offset depression
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.940]   is that there is a genetic predisposition
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.540]   that certain people carry to become depressed.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.680]   There are these studies now of many,
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.260]   many thousands of individuals.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:09.860]   These were mainly done in New Zealand,
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.160]   but these studies have now been done elsewhere,
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.460]   looking at many tens of thousands of individuals
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.680]   who carry particular copies of genes,
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.560]   what they call polymorphisms,
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.980]   in particular of a gene called 5-HTTLPR,
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.320]   which is a serotonin transporter.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.880]   So this is a gene that controls or regulates
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.620]   how much serotonin is available in the brain.
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.100]   If you have this gene, this polymorphism,
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.460]   it doesn't necessarily mean that you will be depressed,
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.560]   but it greatly shifts your susceptibility
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.180]   to depression under conditions of stress.
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.240]   So I realize some people are listening to this
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.660]   and some people are watching it on YouTube,
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.840]   so I'm going to describe this in a way
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.980]   that doesn't require looking at any graphs.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:56.200]   What I want you to imagine is a very shallow hill,
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.100]   like a very mellow hill.
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:02.580]   It's just a ramp set at about 10 or 15 degrees, okay?
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.640]   What we're plotting there in your mind
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:09.640]   is that with each bout of serious stress,
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.540]   so that could be trying to finish a degree
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:14.980]   or a relationship breakup or a family member that's sick
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.740]   or the loss of a loved one or a pet,
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.960]   with each bout of stress,
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.700]   the probability that you will experience
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.060]   a major depression goes up.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:28.060]   However, if you carry this gene, this HTTLPR gene,
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.380]   the steepness of that curve goes way, way up,
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.040]   or it's actually more like a line,
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:39.460]   such that you need far fewer bouts of stress
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.380]   in order to lapse into a major depression, okay?
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.020]   So if the typical person who doesn't carry this polymorphism
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:49.380]   has to experience two or three or four or five bouts of stress
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.940]   before they lapse into a depression,
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.540]   somebody with this gene is susceptible
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.640]   to getting depression after just one bout
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.200]   or two bouts of intense stress, okay?
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.160]   So that's how these genes work.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.800]   They don't preordain or determine you to be depressed.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.460]   They raise a susceptibility.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.740]   And many genes, many things related to heritability
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.100]   in general work in that way.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.320]   And we know there's a strong genetic component
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.160]   to depression.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:16.980]   How do we know?
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:21.060]   Well, in what are called concordant monozygotic twins.
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.580]   So these would be identical twins,
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:26.780]   and they can either be in one biological sac
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.080]   or two biological sacs while in utero,
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.780]   what's called a monochorionic or dichorionic.
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:37.780]   Well, typically it's monochorionic and identical twins
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.940]   for which one of those twins goes on
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.020]   to have major depression.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.440]   There's a 50% probability that the other one
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.580]   will have major depression.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.640]   So it's not 100%.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.140]   It's not 100% inherited.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:50.860]   It's not 100% genetic, as you might say,
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:55.660]   but there's a much higher predisposition for depression.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:59.500]   Whereas in fraternal twins, that number drops.
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.620]   And in siblings, that number drops to about 25%.
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.380]   And in half siblings, it's about 10%.
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.100]   The numbers vary from study to study.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.220]   But basically the more closely related you are
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.460]   to somebody who has major depression,
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.700]   the more likely it is that you will also
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:14.540]   get major depression.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:17.100]   And therefore, if you haven't gotten major depression,
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:20.600]   the more likely it is that you should take steps
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.660]   to learn to mitigate stress,
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.140]   because stress is the major factor
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:27.140]   that can trigger one of these depressive episodes.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:32.140]   Okay, so we've covered a lot related to the stress
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.860]   and the hormones and the neurochemistry of depression.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.560]   In fact, I think this is probably the deepest
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.280]   I've ever gone into the biology of any topic
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.700]   on this podcast before getting to any specific tools.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.640]   I mentioned that learning how to mitigate stress
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.740]   and deal with stress, learning how to measure
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.460]   and adjust your thyroid hormone, those might be useful.
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:53.780]   But next I'd like to turn to some very specific tools
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:57.100]   that people who both have depression
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.580]   or who are prone to depression,
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.020]   as well as people who don't have depression
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.540]   and simply want to maintain a good mood,
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.320]   who want to maintain a positive affect
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.900]   and pursuit of things in life.
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.340]   What are the things that you can do?
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:08.940]   It turns out there are things that you can do.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.880]   And all of the biology that underlies
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.180]   the utility of those things,
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.420]   meaning the reasons those things work
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:17.640]   will now make sense to you,
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.620]   because they adjust things like serotonin and dopamine,
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.180]   and they adjust them through very specific pathways.
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.680]   I know for many people,
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.780]   learning about mechanism is kind of grueling.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.840]   I realize this podcast isn't necessarily one
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.300]   that you can listen to passively while doing other things,
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.740]   although I would hope that you could do that
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.220]   and still enjoy it and extract the information.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.140]   Why mechanism?
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.940]   Mechanism is so key,
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:42.920]   because mechanism is a little bit like understanding
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.580]   some of the chemistry of cooking.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:48.820]   If you read a recipe and you can follow a recipe,
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:52.440]   you often hear people say, "Oh, I can follow a recipe."
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:55.420]   That means that if you have every ingredient in that recipe,
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.260]   you're good.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:58.020]   You likely can make that dish.
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.700]   You can make that meal.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.340]   However, if you understand a little bit of the chemistry
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:06.820]   of why salt has to be added third and not first,
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.820]   or why the heat has to be adjusted at a particular time,
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.140]   well, then not only can you follow a recipe,
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:13.660]   but that also gives you flexibility
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.540]   for when salt isn't available,
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.340]   or when you want to adjust the flavor of the dish,
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.480]   or when you want to try a new dish,
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.640]   or you want to get experimental.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.100]   So when you understand mechanism,
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.780]   it puts you in a tremendous place of power
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.500]   to work with your system.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.880]   So it's not just plug and chug,
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.660]   like take 12 milligrams of this,
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.260]   you either feel better or you don't.
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:37.060]   You can really start to understand how prescription drugs,
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:41.500]   supplements, nutrition, behavioral tools,
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.020]   how those things weave together
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.980]   to either work for you or not work for you,
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:49.180]   and get you to paths of healthy mind and body.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.980]   So let's think about why any tool would work
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.520]   to relieve depression.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.900]   We've talked about how some of the drugs
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.280]   that impact these different chemical systems might work,
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.200]   and why they create some of the problems they create.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.740]   The problems are mainly created by the fact
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.520]   that they impact lots of systems in the brain and body.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.840]   So you take a drug to increase serotonin,
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:10.220]   but that serotonin is also related not just to mood,
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.480]   but to things related to libido and appetite,
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.040]   and so you start disrupting multiple systems.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.960]   The same could be said for behavioral tools, right?
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.180]   That any behavioral tool that adjusts the levels
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.860]   of a particular chemical ought to perhaps provide
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.720]   some relief for some of the symptoms of major depression.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.600]   Let's take an example that I've talked about before
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.220]   on the podcast, which is if you get into a very cold shower,
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:37.260]   you take an ice bath, you will release norepinephrine
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.900]   and epinephrine in your brain and body.
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.900]   There's no question about that.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.020]   I don't think anyone can really escape that.
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.680]   It's a kind of a universal response to being in cold water.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.160]   Well, if some aspects of depression are related
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.220]   to low levels of norepinephrine,
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.660]   will taking cold showers relieve your depression?
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:56.500]   Perhaps.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.920]   It might even relieve certain aspects of that depression.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.760]   Is it a cure?
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.000]   Well, that's going to depend on the individual.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Will exercise help?
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.680]   Well, if you go out for a run,
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.920]   you're going to increase the amount of norepinephrine
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.080]   in your body.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.980]   If you enjoy that run,
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.760]   it's likely that you'll increase the levels of dopamine
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.840]   and probably serotonin in your brain and body as well.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.000]   Will that cure your depression?
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.040]   Well, there are a lot of studies exploring how exercise
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.940]   can impact depression and indeed regular exercise
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:28.000]   is known to be a protective behavior against depression,
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.480]   but it also can help relieve
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.460]   some of the symptoms of depression.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.400]   So you may ask yourself, why would you need drugs at all?
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.520]   Why would there be prescription drugs
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.580]   or the need for supplementation or other things
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.600]   to alleviate the symptoms of depression?
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.880]   Ah, well, that's the diabolical nature of depression,
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.880]   which is if people are far enough along in this thing,
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.520]   this sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.600]   but major depression,
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:58.480]   oftentimes they can't get the energy to even get up
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.800]   and take a bath or a shower.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.100]   They have no motivation to do it.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.160]   They have no desire to go for a run.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.880]   So you say, come on, let's go, you'll feel better.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:07.720]   I know you feel better.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.920]   It generates all these chemicals.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.000]   I heard on the whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.240]   or another podcast that getting into action
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.640]   does all these things and they just don't want to do it.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.160]   And to you, a person who's not experiencing depression
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.040]   that perhaps could just seem like the most frustrating
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.660]   and confusing thing in the world,
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:25.440]   but it's very important to highlight the fact
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.040]   that these circuits that are accessible to some of us,
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.660]   the circuits for happiness, for pursuit of pleasure,
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:36.360]   for exercise, for getting in a cold shower,
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.740]   if that's your thing, that those circuits are present
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:42.520]   in all people, but for certain people
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.160]   that are experiencing major depression
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.960]   and are really in the depths of their depression,
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.600]   they can't really access those circuits in the same way
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:54.200]   that people who are not suffering from depression can.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.180]   So I hope that makes it clear.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:57.360]   It's not offering any excuses for them.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.440]   And indeed, I think those behaviors would help
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.380]   jolt them out of some of the symptomology of depression,
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:07.200]   but they're just not accessible to everybody.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.700]   So let's talk about the things that people can do
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.180]   to deal with depression.
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.660]   And again, anytime you add a behavior or a tool
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:18.860]   or a supplement or subtract a behavior tool,
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:19.940]   supplement, drug, et cetera,
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.680]   you absolutely should talk to your physician,
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.100]   especially if you're somebody
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.180]   that's dealing with major depression.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.860]   I want to focus on the stress system.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.820]   And I'm not just going to tell you
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.380]   to get sunlight in your eyes and to get a good night's sleep,
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.940]   although I think everybody should do that
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.640]   on a regular basis, ideally every day.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.960]   Talked about those ad nauseum on this podcast.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.140]   They will help your sleep.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:41.660]   They will help you alleviate stress.
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:43.320]   I think you should have tools to deal with stress
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.100]   in real time, et cetera.
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:47.340]   But let's look at depression from the standpoint
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.440]   of a deeper biological phenomenon,
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.500]   which is inflammation and the immune system.
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.360]   There's growing evidence now
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.460]   that many forms of major depression,
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:01.460]   if not all of them, relate to excessive inflammation.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.100]   Now, inflammation plays an important role in wound healing
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.580]   is that it is a positive aspect of our immune system,
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:12.580]   our ability to combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:15.640]   but inflammation gone unchecked,
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.140]   inflammation that lasts too long or is of too high amplitude,
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:23.340]   meaning too many anti-inflammatory or inflammatory cytokines
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.920]   and things of that sort in the body is bad.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.940]   And there's decent evidence now
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:32.340]   that inflammation can lead to or exacerbate depression.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.380]   And that if we want to control depression
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.740]   or limit or eliminate depression,
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:40.180]   that focusing on reducing inflammation
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.840]   and its associated pathways is a really good thing to do.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.860]   And I think this is a really good thing
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:47.300]   for everybody to do, regardless of whether or not
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.660]   you suffer from depression or not.
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:52.140]   And today we're going to talk about exactly how depression
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.540]   comes about through the inflammation pathway.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:59.340]   So first of all, who are the major players
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.620]   in creating chronic inflammation in the brain and body?
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:04.980]   They are the inflammatory cytokines,
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.420]   things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:11.660]   things like tumor necrosis alpha, TNF alpha,
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:15.340]   things like C-reactive protein, all right?
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.060]   Not all of these are cytokines, you have interferons
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.580]   and your prostaglandins and a lot of these things,
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:23.580]   but when we are stressed, chronically stressed,
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:26.620]   we get inflamed, our brain and various locations
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.740]   in the brain become inflamed because certain classes
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.380]   of cells in particular, those glial cells,
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.140]   the cells that are typically thought
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:36.460]   to just be support cells, those cells and their biochemistry
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.140]   and their dialogue with the neurons of the brain and body
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:40.580]   starts to become disrupted.
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:44.100]   I may have mentioned it earlier, I don't recall,
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.540]   but I certainly mentioned it in an earlier podcast
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:50.260]   that adrenaline, epinephrine, when it's released in the body
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.860]   it doesn't cross the brain barrier,
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.140]   but there are certain things that are able
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.960]   to cross the blood-brain barrier when we are stressed,
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.980]   things like the E2 prostaglandins,
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:01.100]   those cross the blood-brain barrier
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.520]   and our blood and our brain,
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.140]   therefore our brain and our body can communicate
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.400]   because certain things can pass through this barrier
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.240]   we call the BBB or the blood-brain barrier
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.380]   and also we have something called the glymphatic system,
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.700]   which is really a plumbing system
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:15.820]   that links the brain and body,
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:19.540]   it's the link between the immune system and the brain.
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:23.940]   Well, there is a set of actions that we can take
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.400]   in order to limit inflammation
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:29.420]   and this has been shown in several quality
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:32.620]   peer-reviewed studies now to reduce inflammation
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:35.280]   and to relieve some, and in some cases,
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.700]   all of the symptoms of major depression.
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:41.660]   One of those approaches is to increase our intake
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.460]   of so-called EPAs or essential fatty acids.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.720]   There's now a very long list of papers in quality
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.640]   peer-reviewed journals showing that when people ingest
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:58.640]   a certain level of EPA omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.780]   the relief from depressive symptoms matches the SSRIs.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.880]   That's incredible, right?
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.280]   That essential fatty acids could relieve symptoms
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.580]   of depression as well as some
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.800]   of the prescription antidepressants.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.880]   Now this doesn't necessarily mean you run off
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.680]   and stop taking your antidepressants
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.560]   if you've been prescribed them.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.400]   Please don't do that.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.640]   Please talk to your physician.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.480]   And I should mention that some of these same studies
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.560]   have shown that increasing our intake
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.980]   of these essential fatty acids,
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:30.840]   in particular the EPA variety of omega-3s,
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.680]   can lower the effective dose of things like SSRIs,
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.820]   meaning if we required a 50 milligram
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.560]   or 40 milligram dose of fluoxetine,
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.840]   that one can get by on a lower dose
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:46.360]   and thereby perhaps not experience as many
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.800]   or as severe side effects by taking
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.240]   or supplementing with EPAs.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.980]   Now the threshold level seems to be about one gram,
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.140]   a thousand milligrams of EPA.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:00.360]   So you will sometimes see on a bottle of krill oil
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.320]   or fish oil or any other source,
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.280]   even plant source or other source of EPA,
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.360]   that it's a thousand milligrams or 1200 milligrams.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.640]   But what's really important to look at is
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.400]   whether or not there's more than a thousand milligrams
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.160]   of EPA, because the EPA in particular
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.280]   is what's important here.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.280]   And actually in exploring some of the literature
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.120]   on the effects of EPAs on cardiovascular health,
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.700]   as well as their effects on depression,
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.960]   there's some interesting dose dependent responses
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:36.000]   such that people who took anywhere from 400 milligrams
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.320]   to 5,000 milligrams of EPAs achieved a variety
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.520]   of different benefits.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.260]   And in some cases, some side effects,
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:44.360]   we'll talk about those.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.280]   And it does seem that this thousand milligrams
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.460]   is the critical threshold for benefiting
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.720]   or getting some relief from depressive symptoms.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.360]   But people who took two grams seem to do better.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.680]   And in the cardiovascular health realm,
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.680]   there it's a little more complicated.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.080]   Some studies point to a very positive effect
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.920]   on cardiovascular health by taking increasing amounts
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.160]   of EPA, others not so much.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.240]   The current data point to the fact
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.880]   that for every gram of EPA that one ingest,
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.220]   there's about a 9% improvement in cardiovascular health.
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:21.560]   The same dose dependent improvement on psychological health
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.600]   in combating depression can't really be stated.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.200]   I wouldn't say that the more EPA you take,
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.220]   the better you're going to feel, so to speak.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.760]   I don't think the data point to that.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.200]   However, it does seem that if you take a gram,
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.420]   a thousand milligrams or 2000 milligrams of EPA,
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.840]   there does seem to be some substantial relief
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.500]   for many people, which I emphasize many, not all,
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.800]   for many people in major depressive symptoms.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.240]   So how would this work?
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:52.020]   Well, it turns out that these inflammatory cytokines,
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:56.600]   they impact neurons and the circuits of the brain
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.360]   that relate to things like serotonin,
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.560]   dopamine, and norepinephrine.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.280]   These inflammatory cytokines act in a variety
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.000]   of different ways, but they mainly act to inhibit
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.160]   the release of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine,
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.320]   or the synthesis of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.120]   And I'll give you one example of how EPAs
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.080]   can positively impact this process.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.860]   And then it points to a second tool,
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.760]   which is the proper utilization of exercise
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.900]   to offset the effects of depression.
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:29.420]   So now you should understand why having healthy levels
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.760]   of serotonin is important for maintaining healthy mood.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.840]   It's not responsible for all the aspects
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.980]   of having a healthy mood.
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.560]   There's also dopamine and norepinephrine,
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.800]   but it is a very important one.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.000]   Dopamine, also called 5-HT,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.560]   essentially derives from a precursor called tryptophan.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.800]   Tryptophan arrives into our system through our diet, okay?
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.800]   Tryptophan is an amino acid.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.600]   Tryptophan is found in turkey.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.640]   It's found in carbohydrates.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.000]   And that should therefore raise the idea of,
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.080]   hmm, I wonder if one of the reasons why people
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.540]   who are depressed have such an appetite for carbohydrate
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:12.180]   laden foods is because they're trying to get more tryptophan
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.960]   and therefore more serotonin.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.520]   And indeed that's the case.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:19.820]   Tryptophan is eventually converted into serotonin.
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:23.380]   However, if there's excessive amounts of inflammation,
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:28.500]   these inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.640]   to not be converted so much into serotonin,
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.180]   but to be diverted down a different pathway.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.760]   The pathway involves something called IDO, indolamine,
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.260]   which converts tryptophan into kynuren, okay?
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:46.020]   Kynuren actually acts as a neurotoxin
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:50.720]   by way of converting into something called quinolinic acid,
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.560]   okay?
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.500]   And quinolinic acid is pro-depressive.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.920]   So if that seems like a complicated biochemical pathway,
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.220]   what's basically happening here is that the tryptophan
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.420]   that normally would be made into serotonin
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.900]   under conditions of inflammation
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:06.260]   is being diverted into a neurotoxic pathway.
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.040]   And ingestion of EPAs,
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.140]   because it limits these inflammatory cytokines,
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.840]   things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera,
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:19.900]   can cause more of the tryptophan that one ingests
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.940]   or has in their body to be diverted
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.800]   towards the serotonergic pathway.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:29.980]   Exercise, it turns out, also has a positive effect
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:34.060]   on the tryptophan to serotonin conversion pathway.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.860]   And the way it does it is really interesting.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.340]   You now know that tryptophan
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.340]   can either be converted into serotonin
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.300]   or it can be converted into this neurotoxin,
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.580]   which is a bad thing.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.260]   Exercise, the activation of the muscles
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.880]   through rhythmic repeated use,
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.180]   in particular aerobic exercise,
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:51.020]   but also resistance training
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.460]   has been shown to do this to some extent,
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:58.340]   tends to sequester or shuttle the kynuren into the muscle
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.300]   so that it isn't converted into this neurotoxin
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.860]   that is pro-depression, okay?
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.100]   There are a lot of steps in the pathway
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.620]   leading to depression.
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.100]   But what this essentially means
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:12.380]   is that hitting a certain threshold level of EPA intake,
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:15.500]   whether by supplementation with fish oil or krill oil
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.900]   or through some plant source,
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.700]   if you're not into ingesting fish or krill,
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:23.860]   or trying to get up above that 1,000 milligram threshold
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.940]   for EPA by ingesting particular food sources,
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.060]   you certainly can do it through food,
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.540]   you don't have to supplement,
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:31.380]   but it's easier to do with supplements,
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:33.620]   that doing that will limit the inflammation
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:36.740]   that diverts tryptophan into this neurotoxic pathway.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:41.480]   And exercise as well augments this conversion
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.380]   of tryptophan into serotonin
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.900]   because it takes this thing
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.780]   that would potentially be a neurotoxin
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:51.120]   and it sequesters it, it pulls it away
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.540]   so that it can't actually go have its pro-depressive effects.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.000]   So you've got multiple steps here.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.240]   We're describing two tools, increasing EPA
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.960]   and regular exercise as a way of increasing serotonin
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.580]   somewhat indirectly, right?
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.480]   It's by limiting this bad pathway
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.200]   to promote the activity of a good pathway.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.460]   But from the data that are published
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.820]   in quality peer review journals,
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.700]   it really appears that this inflammation pathway
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:19.220]   does function to increase depression through these pathways.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.380]   And so knowing that there are behavioral steps
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.980]   and supplementation-based steps,
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.940]   or if you prefer getting your EPAs from typical food,
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.580]   from nutritional approaches,
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.580]   I find that very reassuring that the mechanisms
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.360]   all converge on a common pathway, serotonin.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.820]   That gives me great peace of mind
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.840]   that when people say, hey, go out for a run
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.580]   or you should get outdoors, exercise,
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.480]   or you should take fish oil,
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.540]   or like the Scandinavians do,
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.900]   I have Scandinavian family members,
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.840]   and they are known to,
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.260]   or I should say they are quite open about the fact
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.060]   that during the winter months in particular
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:55.920]   when depression is more likely,
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.400]   but throughout the year, really,
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.920]   they make an effort to regularly ingest high levels of EPA,
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.180]   either through ingesting fatty fish and its skin.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.520]   I'm not a particular fan of ingesting the skin of fatty fish
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.740]   or by supplementing with cod liver oil
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:11.900]   or other types of fish oil,
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:14.540]   sardines and things of that sort, sardine oils.
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:15.800]   There are a number of different things out there
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.220]   that one could use.
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:19.580]   So I find it very reassuring
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.660]   that there's a common biochemical pathway
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.820]   that can explain why these things not just work,
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.520]   but why they should work.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.060]   They should work because they operate
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.540]   in the very same biochemical pathways
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:34.680]   that antidepressants that are prescribed to people do.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.760]   So what does this mean for you?
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.720]   Well, if you're somebody who suffers from major depression,
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.040]   again, don't stop taking your prescribed medication,
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:41.880]   talk to your doctor,
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:46.880]   but talk to them perhaps about the EPAs and exercise
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.360]   and how these things can impinge
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.160]   on the same biochemical pathways.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.380]   If you're somebody who's not suffering
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:52.500]   from major depression,
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.480]   I still think these pathways are really important
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.180]   to understand and actually knowing these pathways
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:01.100]   is additional motivation to get regular exercise.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.980]   I think we all know that we should be getting anywhere
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.820]   from 150 minutes to 180 minutes per week
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:08.820]   of so-called zone two cardio for cardiovascular effects.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.740]   Zone two is the kind of mellowish cardio
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.740]   where you can sort of hold a conversation
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.300]   if you needed to, but it's a little bit tough.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.540]   You're kind of sucking for air a little bit
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:20.080]   and that's going to limit these depressive like symptoms.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:20.940]   I think in all of us,
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.700]   I don't think that we should think of depression
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.740]   as a strict threshold.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.220]   I'm somebody who personally has made the choice
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.740]   to take a thousand milligrams of EPA per day.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:33.020]   I do that by supplementing fish oil.
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.120]   There's debate out there as to whether or not
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.860]   it's better to take EPA and DHA in particular ratios
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:43.340]   and whether or not DHA can impact the LDL,
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.260]   which is the so-called bad cholesterol.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.980]   That's getting really down into the weeds
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:49.160]   and we can talk about that in a future episode.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.400]   But for myself, I notice a pretty substantial
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.360]   positive effect of taking anywhere
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.400]   from a thousand milligrams to 2000 milligrams
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.440]   of EPA per day.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.740]   I do that through supplementation
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:02.080]   and I do strive to try and eat some fish,
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.680]   even though frankly, I've never liked the taste of fish.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.740]   For those of you that would like a little more detail
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:09.640]   or perhaps a lot more detail into the effects
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:14.220]   of EPA on depression and in relieving depressive symptoms,
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.120]   and if you want to get into the nitty gritty of it,
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.780]   I invite you to go to examine.com, put in depression, EPA.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:24.900]   They list off and have links to 28 studies
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.120]   on the effects of EPA on major depression.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.940]   If you go to PubMed, there are many, many studies on this
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:34.000]   now that date back several decades, really.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.300]   If you're interested in the specific effects of EPA
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.460]   as opposed to DHA, I want to point you towards
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.180]   a particular study entitled, not surprisingly,
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:48.240]   EPA but not DHA appears to be responsible
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.000]   for the efficacy of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.200]   fatty acid supplementation and depression,
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.960]   evidence from a meta analysis of randomized control trials.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.080]   This is a really wonderful paper.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:02.240]   The author is Julian Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-S.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.760]   It was published in 2009.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.080]   We will provide a link to this study in the caption.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.400]   And that study is really the one that at least to me
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.080]   points to why EPA in particular is what's effective.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:19.260]   And that whether or not DHA is problematic or not
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:22.200]   is a separate issue, but it's really the EPA
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.160]   that one wants to hit a certain threshold level of
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:28.160]   if one's goal is to get relief from depression
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:31.600]   or to keep depression at bay by keeping mood elevated,
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.000]   which is why I take a high dose EPA.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.240]   So we've got EPA, we've got exercise.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.580]   Now you understand how they work to adjust mood.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.620]   Now I want to talk about something that at least for me
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:47.400]   was quite surprising when I first learned about it
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.400]   for sake of treatment of mood disorders
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.160]   and that's creatine.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.900]   Creatine has a number of very important functions
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.220]   throughout the body.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.620]   For those of you that are into resistance training
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.680]   and actually for those of you
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.800]   that are into endurance training as well,
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.360]   creatine has achieved a lot of popularity in recent years
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.960]   because supplementation with creatine
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.960]   can draw more water into muscles
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.820]   and can increase power output from muscles.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:18.260]   So it's something that does indeed work.
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:20.460]   There have been debates about whether or not
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.700]   it's unhealthy for the kidneys
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.480]   to take long-term creatine supplementation at high doses.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.760]   And I invite you to go down that rabbit hole.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.300]   I think most people now accept the idea
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.740]   that for most people, not all, but for most people,
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.300]   low dose creatine supplementation
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.640]   of anywhere from one gram to five grams per day
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.380]   can have a number of positive effects
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.380]   on physical performance.
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.000]   People with kidney issues, et cetera,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.280]   need to be especially cautious,
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.960]   but creatine is interesting for that purpose.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:50.520]   However, there's also a so-called phosphocreatine system
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.820]   in the brain and that phosphocreatine system
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.460]   has everything to do with the dialogue
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:58.700]   between neurons and these other cell types called glia
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.600]   and glia comprise several cell types,
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.260]   microglia, astrocytes, et cetera.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:08.340]   But the phosphocreatine system in the forebrain in particular
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.220]   in the front of our brain has been shown to be involved
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:15.460]   in regulation of mood and some of the reward pathways,
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:17.940]   as well as in depression.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:22.260]   And there are now several studies, at least three,
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:25.980]   although there are probably more by time this comes out
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.980]   because they're coming out very quickly now,
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:30.540]   at least three quality studies pointing to the fact
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.980]   that creatine supplementation
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.300]   doesn't just have these positive effects
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.280]   on physical performance,
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:40.980]   but can also be used as a way to increase mood
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:44.100]   and to improve the symptoms of major depression.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:49.100]   This has been now done in several double-blind,
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.540]   placebo-controlled studies.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:55.540]   These studies have looked at women, have looked at men,
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.540]   have looked at adolescents, some of whom were taking SSRIs,
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.420]   some of whom were not.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:05.860]   They've done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:09.520]   So spectroscopy is a way that you can look at
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.200]   the concentrations of particular compounds in the brain
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.960]   in real time in humans.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.660]   It can be used for other things as well, of course.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.920]   And basically what's been observed is that
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.840]   increasing the activity of the phosphocreatine system
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.940]   in the forebrain can be beneficial,
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:27.140]   or at least as correlated with improvements in mood.
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.740]   So let's just talk for a moment about what's involved
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:32.400]   with using or supplementing creatine
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.000]   in order to improve mood and perhaps even treat depression.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.140]   First of all, when I talk about creatine,
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:42.700]   I'm talking about creatine monohydrate.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.300]   There are a number of different forms of creatine.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:47.260]   Here I'm talking about creatine monohydrate.
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:52.260]   The American Journal of Psychiatry in 2012 published a study
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:54.740]   which was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.860]   of oral creatine monohydrate.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.440]   And what it found is that it could augment
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.920]   or enhance the response to a selective serotonin
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.460]   reuptake inhibitor, in particular in women
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.120]   with major depressive disorder.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.940]   So like EPA, creatine supplementation
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:14.680]   seems to either lower the required dose of SSRI
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.540]   that's required to treat depression,
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:21.540]   or can improve the effectiveness of a given dose of SSRI.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:25.240]   However, there are other studies that have looked directly
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.940]   at creatine supplementation in the absence of SSRIs,
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.360]   and those are interesting as well.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:32.780]   There's a wonderful and very comprehensive review
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:35.760]   on creatine for the treatment of major depression
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.340]   that includes beautiful tables of all the subjects
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.560]   and the dosages, et cetera.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.480]   I'm not going to read off every line
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.160]   and every column in that review,
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.660]   but we will provide a link to that review as well.
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:51.960]   One of the things that's really striking
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.820]   about the lists of studies that they include
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:58.080]   is that most of them used dosages
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.960]   that are pretty reasonable for most people,
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.800]   anywhere from three grams to five grams,
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.960]   sometimes up to as many 10 grams per day of creatine.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.980]   Many of these also were shown to increase activity
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.040]   of this phosphocreatine system in the forebrain,
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.600]   and some show a relationship
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.240]   between that phosphocreatine system
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.480]   and a particular category of receptors in the brain
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.480]   called the NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.080]   The NMDA receptor is one of the first things
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.000]   that every budding neuroscientist learns about
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.340]   because it is the receptor
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:43.520]   that has particular electrical and chemical properties
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.520]   that make it a critical gate for so-called neuroplasticity.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.360]   So it's not a receptor that's activated in the brain
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.320]   typically for just the functioning of the brain
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.680]   on a day-to-day basis.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.240]   It's a receptor that's activated
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.900]   when circuits are going to change,
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:03.780]   when they are inspired to change
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.440]   by some very strong stimulus, meaning some experience,
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.420]   or in some cases a drug, or in some cases something else.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:15.760]   But the NMDA receptor is a kind of a key node
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.340]   for shifting brain circuitry.
[01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:20.100]   And so while the details aren't entirely clear,
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.180]   it seems that creatine supplementation
[01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:26.280]   leads to increases in the phosphocreatine system
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.560]   in the forebrain,
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.520]   and that increases in the activity
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.980]   of the forebrain phosphocreatine system
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:36.960]   relate to changes in the way the NMDA receptors function
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.840]   and may lead to some of the plasticity,
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.120]   the changes in neural circuits that underlie the shift
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.940]   from negative mood and affect to positive mood.
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.040]   Now, there are a lot of gaps.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.560]   Those are, you know, there are a lot of little boxes
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.880]   or bins in the diagram I just laid out for you,
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.640]   and some of them are still truly black boxes, as we say,
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.680]   meaning we don't really know what's in them yet,
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.400]   and more mechanistic data are coming.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.600]   However, when you look over the data in this review,
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.900]   or when I look over the data in this review,
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.060]   what you find is that
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:07.400]   they're pretty striking positive effects of creatine.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.180]   And one of the more interesting effects
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.960]   is that creatine has actually been shown
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.960]   to increase mania in people that are already manic.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.740]   And that's interesting.
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:22.000]   We're not talking about bipolar depression today,
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.480]   but it seems that creatine elevates levels of activation
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.620]   and kind of mood overall.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:28.620]   And you could see why that would be a problem for somebody
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:29.960]   that's already in a manic phase,
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.520]   but it actually might be beneficial for somebody
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:37.200]   who is very low affect and has major depression.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.180]   So should you supplement with creatine?
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:42.560]   Well, as always, talk to your healthcare provider.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.760]   But if you're somebody who is thinking about things
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.000]   that you can do and things that you can take
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.680]   in order to improve your mood, keep depression at bay,
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:55.680]   maybe even support other treatments for major depression,
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.700]   the creatine system seems like a logical one.
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:01.680]   There's at least strong studies
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.800]   and a good number of them to look to
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.240]   to determine whether or not that's right for you.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.500]   I personally take five grams of creatine for other reasons.
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.500]   I take it for the physical performance enhancing effects,
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.700]   but it's kind of nice to think that perhaps
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.780]   it's also helping me improve my mood.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.140]   That's a choice that I've made for me
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:24.120]   as in within the margins of safety for me in my life.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.040]   I don't know that it's right for everybody,
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.860]   but I find it very interesting.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:29.900]   And again, I find it particularly interesting
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.800]   because there's a logical biochemical pathway
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.200]   to support the finding that it improves mood
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.640]   and can offset the effects of major depression
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.120]   in some cases, or can improve the effects
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:44.000]   of antidepressant medication in many cases.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.240]   When I see mechanism and I see effectiveness
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.580]   and the mechanism and the effectiveness map
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.200]   to a lot of the same mechanisms
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.720]   that are involved in prescription drugs,
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.400]   that gives me great reassurance
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.240]   that this isn't just some sort of mysterious pathway
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:01.580]   or mysterious compound by which creatine might be working.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:06.040]   So now we've clustered together EPA's exercise
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.880]   and their relationship to inflammation,
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.320]   creatine and its relationship to forebrain function
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.920]   and the phosphocreatine system and this NMDA receptor.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.080]   And as you'll see in a few minutes,
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.520]   that NMDA receptor turns out to be vitally important
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.600]   and is actually one of the main nodes of action
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.160]   for some of the more novel and exciting therapeutics
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.800]   that are being explored now in psychiatric clinics.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.200]   So let's talk a little bit more about this NMDA receptor
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.720]   and how it relates to some of the more experimental
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.600]   or novel therapeutic compounds
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.200]   for the treatment of major depression.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.620]   And the compounds that we're going to be talking about,
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:46.980]   you may have heard of before, one is ketamine,
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:50.620]   which is getting increasing interest in psychiatric clinics
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:53.460]   and in various experimental and clinical studies.
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.840]   And the other is PCP.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.940]   Both ketamine and PCP are known drugs of abuse.
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.540]   For many years, people have abused these drugs,
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:05.440]   go by the street name Special K, et cetera,
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.860]   and they create dissociative anesthetic states.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:12.060]   So dissociative states where people don't feel
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:15.180]   as closely meshed with their emotions
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:20.180]   and their perceptions, it's an odd state I hear,
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:24.080]   and it's an odd state that clinicians are now leveraging
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.380]   for the treatment of depression.
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.680]   We'll talk about why that is,
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.580]   but let's talk a little bit about this NMDA receptor
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:32.760]   and why ketamine and PCP might work
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.840]   for the treatment of depression or how they even could work.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.160]   I want to be very direct that this is an area
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.960]   that still needs a lot of data.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.900]   There are however, some excellent papers
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.940]   from really terrific groups.
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:49.560]   One of them is a paper that was published
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:52.100]   in "Nature" last year, 2020.
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:56.060]   First author is Vesuna, Sam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-N-A,
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:57.780]   and the last author and the lead on the study
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:02.420]   was Dr. Karl Deisseroth, who was a guest
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:05.620]   on the Huberman Lab podcast a few months ago.
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.560]   He's a world expert in neuroscience.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.200]   He's a psychiatrist.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:13.260]   And this paper from Sam Vesuna and Karl
[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:16.560]   and colleagues explored how these dissociative states
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.400]   come about.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.400]   And they looked at this both in animals and in humans
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.800]   and found that there was essentially a common mechanism
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:27.360]   whereby a particular layer of cortex.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.480]   So your brain has this outer shell of tissue
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.160]   that is called the neocortex.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.360]   It's where our perceptions lie.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.160]   It's where our associations lie.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.760]   It's a very important area for processing,
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.800]   decision-making and planning, et cetera.
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.220]   It's literally stacks of cells.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:48.940]   And one of those layers in the stack of cells is layer five.
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:50.940]   And the layer five neurons in particular
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:54.040]   went into a particular rhythm of electrical activity,
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:56.400]   this one to three Hertz rhythm,
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:01.400]   after mice or humans were administered ketamine or PCP.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:07.020]   There was activation of a particular area of the brain,
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:09.720]   this retrosplenial cortex, as it's called,
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:14.140]   and the dissociative state that emerged
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.860]   was an interesting one.
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:20.180]   And clinically what's described in the trials for ketamine
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:21.480]   and things like it,
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.180]   that people who are depressed will take ketamine,
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:28.980]   will experience a kind of separateness from their grief
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:31.020]   and from their emotions.
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:33.660]   And that possibly there's plasticity.
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.660]   There are actually shifts in the neural circuitry
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:39.600]   such that their emotions don't weigh on them so heavily.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.780]   I'm using very loose language here,
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:45.660]   but that they don't feel as over ridden
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.360]   or as burdened by their own emotions
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.760]   as they did previously to the ketamine therapy.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.140]   Now, absolutely in no way, shape or form,
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:55.180]   in my suggestion that people run out and take ketamine
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:56.980]   in order to treat their own depression.
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:00.540]   These drugs are still very much experimental,
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:04.020]   although they are approved in certain contexts,
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:06.740]   at least in the US by prescription
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:08.340]   for the treatment of depression.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:13.360]   What's interesting to me is that these dissociative states
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.780]   sound, at least at the outset,
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:20.120]   to be more of a separateness from everything.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.360]   It sounds a little bit like depression itself.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.560]   It's sort of like anhedonia,
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.320]   an inability to experience pleasure.
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:30.500]   And then one takes a dissociative anesthetic
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.940]   and somehow is able to get relief
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.000]   by getting even further away from an experience.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.620]   To me, that doesn't make sense,
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:40.740]   but that just speaks to the fact that these drugs
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:43.620]   and these receptors and these pack pathways
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:46.660]   operate through very cryptic means.
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:49.060]   And we really don't understand all the pathways in the brain
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:51.740]   that relate to motivation and mood and so forth.
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.500]   And the results with these ketamine trials
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.600]   are looking very promising.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:59.380]   In fact, there are a number of trials that show that
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.260]   a fair number of people that take ketamine
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.060]   in a therapeutic setting legally
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:05.920]   with a psychiatrist guiding the experience
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.520]   are able to get relief from their symptoms
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:12.080]   without the need for many, many treatments with the drug.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.640]   Just how many treatments varies
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.900]   from individual to individual,
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:18.440]   but it's not like people have to take this stuff ongoing.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:22.380]   This is really an attempt to tap into this NMDA receptor
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.920]   that is related to neuroplasticity.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:30.560]   Both ketamine and PCP essentially act as antagonists,
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.640]   which means they block the NMDA receptor.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.680]   They do it through different methods,
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.080]   non-competitive and competitive
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.380]   for you chemists and pharmacologists out there.
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:42.260]   You can look it up if you like.
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:45.140]   But what's therefore even more surprising
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.420]   is that every neuroscientist learns
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:50.380]   that activation of the NMDA receptor,
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:53.660]   not antagonism or blocking of the NMDA receptor,
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:56.440]   leads to changes in neural circuitry in very profound ways.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.900]   In fact, experimentally,
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.180]   and I've done these experiments myself,
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.400]   if you want to prevent plasticity,
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.660]   you want to prevent an experience
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.180]   from reshaping neural circuitry,
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:08.020]   you give an NMDA receptor blocker.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:09.200]   I've done that many times
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.760]   in the course of my experimental neuroscience career,
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.880]   not to myself, obviously,
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.940]   but in the course of doing experiments.
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:21.300]   So it's still a bit mysterious to me how this could work.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:22.140]   A couple of things,
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:26.720]   one is this layer five activation is pretty interesting.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.280]   We're going to come back to layer five
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:31.480]   when we talk about yet another emerging treatment
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.660]   for depression, which is psilocybin, so-called magic mushrooms
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:38.460]   and the effects of psilocybin
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:41.000]   on layer five neurons in the cortex.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.600]   So there's a common theme emerging here,
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.360]   which is that layer five activity in the cortex
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.200]   may be important for rewiring the brain in certain ways
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:53.200]   that can lead to recovery or to an alleviation
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.400]   of some of the symptoms of major depression.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.420]   So if this is sounding a little bit vague to you,
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:03.380]   it's because this is still truly experimental and new
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:05.600]   and still very much on the cutting edge
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.440]   of what's happening now, we don't have all the answers.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.520]   So if it sounds like I'm moving slowly through this
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.780]   and I'm being extra careful about what I say,
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:17.780]   you are correct, your antennae are correct in this case.
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:21.760]   I never want to misstep and say something that's not true,
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.960]   but that's especially the case
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.240]   when we're talking about experimental therapies and drugs,
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.220]   which formerly were taken as drugs of abuse,
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.920]   which are now being used as drugs
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:31.960]   for therapeutic treatment in the clinic.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.840]   There is a very interesting study.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.640]   This was published in Science in 2019.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.120]   So these are very recent studies.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.440]   The last author on this is Liston, L-I-S-T-O-N.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.040]   The title of the paper is "Sustained Rescue
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.340]   of Prefrontal Circuit Dysfunction
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.200]   by Antidepressant-Induced Spine Formation."
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.160]   And here, when we hear spine,
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:57.360]   we're not referring to spine as in your vertebrae
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.940]   running down your spinal column.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:01.100]   We're talking about the spines,
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.180]   which are these little protrusions on neurons.
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:07.380]   Neurons are not smooth by any stretch.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:09.380]   If you zoom in on a neuron,
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:10.440]   if you were to come to my lab
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:13.120]   and look down the microscope at a neuron and zoom in on it,
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.440]   you'd find that some neurons are smooth,
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.340]   but most neurons have these little protrusions,
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:18.420]   and those little protrusions are called spines.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:22.000]   And those little spiny protrusions are little sites
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.900]   where neurons can reach out and form and receive
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.760]   new synapses from neighboring neurons.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.880]   So they increase the surface area of a neuron
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.980]   and allow new connections to be formed.
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:36.340]   And so spine formation is synonymous with neuroplasticity,
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:38.800]   which is synonymous with changes in circuit function,
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.520]   which is synonymous with changes in the ways that we think,
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.160]   we feel, and we behave.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.920]   And what was shown in this study is really interesting.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.880]   What they showed is that ketamine
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.400]   can relieve depressive symptoms rapidly
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:56.920]   by changing or increasing, in this case,
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.660]   the spines on these neurons in the prefrontal cortex.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:02.740]   And if that word prefrontal rings a bell,
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.680]   well, now you remember the phosphocreatine system,
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:08.580]   the ingestion of creatine monohydrate,
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:12.340]   and the forebrain, activation of the forebrain,
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:15.180]   were related to, in some way or another,
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:19.380]   to relief or improvement of major depressive symptoms.
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.820]   So we're starting to converge on a picture here
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:25.400]   whereby these drugs, ketamine, PCP,
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.360]   used in a therapeutic context,
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.540]   may be increasing neuroplasticity,
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:33.640]   literally the changing of neural circuits in the forebrain,
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:36.540]   somehow through dissociative states.
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:38.640]   And I don't want to speculate too much
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.600]   about how that might come about,
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:44.720]   but one of the things that's such a resounding
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.600]   or repeating theme of major depression
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.060]   is that when you talk to somebody who has major depression,
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.000]   it is a real downer,
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.200]   and I'm not being disparaging of those people,
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.380]   but if you've ever had a conversation
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.960]   with someone who's depressed,
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.180]   they're always talking about how exhausted they are,
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:01.140]   or in really severe cases,
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.820]   they are not even responsive at all.
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:06.480]   They just kind of stare at you blankly or they fall asleep.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.160]   I mean, they're truly depressed.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:12.120]   Their system is lowered in terms of its activation state.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.900]   So I think that it's interesting
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:18.020]   that the application of drugs
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:20.660]   that allow people to separate from that state
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:22.820]   of not caring or being uninterested
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:24.700]   or unwilling to do anything
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.680]   is actually one of the paths to treatment.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:29.260]   It's not always about just getting people peppy
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:31.440]   and excited and happy.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:32.900]   There also seems to be a requirement
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:36.320]   for getting them distanced from their own grief.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.680]   And this brings us back to something that we talked about
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:40.840]   way back at the beginning of this episode,
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:43.920]   which was this particular feature
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.760]   of the anti-self confabulation,
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:49.300]   that everything that happens is a reflection
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:50.940]   that I should say for the depressed person,
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:52.740]   that everything that happens is a reflection
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.940]   of how life is bad and their experiences
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:58.100]   just point to the fact that nothing is going to get better.
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:00.060]   This is the common language of depression.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:02.660]   If this is very depressing to hear me talk about,
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:04.020]   it is heavy.
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:06.340]   And that's what it's like to hear these things.
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:07.420]   It's even heavier, of course,
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:09.460]   for somebody to experience them.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:14.460]   And those beliefs, those patterns of guilt and grief
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:18.840]   and anhedonia and delusional anti-self confabulations,
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.500]   those are the things that eventually,
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.120]   if they get severe enough,
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:26.180]   start to convert into things like self-harm, mutilation,
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:29.640]   and in the most tragic of cases, of course, suicide.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:33.400]   And so I think we can look to these treatments
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.660]   such as ketamine and PCP,
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:38.640]   but in particular ketamine and its use in the clinic
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:41.080]   as ways for people to get distanced
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.700]   from the negative affect that they feel
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.600]   isn't just inside them or overwhelms them,
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.300]   but that for the very severely depressed person,
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.420]   they feel is them.
[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.020]   And we hear this sometimes, you are not your emotions.
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:55.340]   That's a statement that I've always been
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:56.180]   a little bit challenged by.
[01:31:56.180 --> 01:32:01.140]   I mean, yes, indeed, emotions are not who we are.
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:03.100]   They are states that we go into and out of,
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:04.940]   including happiness and sadness,
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:08.940]   but they are very much a part of us when we experience them.
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:11.200]   We don't experience them as next to us or behind us
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.840]   or across the room from us.
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.900]   We experience them as our emotions.
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:17.680]   They are so much part and parcel
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.760]   with our experience of ourself
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.300]   that a statement like we aren't our emotions
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:24.120]   is a very hard statement to digest,
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:26.020]   especially for the depressed person.
[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:28.940]   And so I think that the NMDA receptor
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:32.500]   and its capacity to induce neuroplasticity circuit changes,
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.880]   the fact that PCP and ketamine
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.420]   are both showing activation of neural circuits
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:40.140]   by way of suppressing activity of the NMDA receptor
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:43.440]   and some of the positive or exciting therapeutic outcomes
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.640]   that are coming from this
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.640]   really point to the fact that ketamine and PCP
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:51.200]   and removal of negative experiences
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.680]   or the experience of a negative experience,
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.080]   it's sort of getting meta there,
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.900]   but the experience of a negative experience
[01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:58.380]   may be an important path
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:00.720]   by which people treat their depression,
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.600]   especially in its most severe forms
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:04.560]   where people are veering towards
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:07.480]   self-harm, mutilation, and suicide.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.880]   So you may have noticed a theme,
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.080]   which is that certain categories of approaches
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:12.040]   that we've been discussing
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.680]   for offsetting the symptoms of depression,
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:19.680]   such as exercise, ingesting EPAs, reducing inflammation,
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:22.700]   or even the SSRIs for increasing serotonin,
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:27.440]   focus on changing some core biological function,
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.700]   like raising the amount of a chemical, serotonin,
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:33.360]   or reducing the amount of inflammatory cytokines
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.480]   in the brain and body.
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:38.920]   And yet things like ketamine focus more
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:42.060]   on rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.760]   so that it functions better in the immediate
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.380]   and hopefully in the long-term as well,
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.040]   and keep people with major depression
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:52.100]   in what they call remission, away from major depression.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:53.780]   Another category of treatments
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:57.040]   that's being actively explored now in laboratories
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.780]   and in the psychiatry realm are the psychedelics.
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:03.800]   And that's a huge category of compounds.
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:07.400]   However, one in particular, psilocybin,
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:11.180]   is one that's being most intensely and actively pursued
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:14.240]   for its capacity to treat major depressive disorder.
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:16.280]   I want to be very clear that the work
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.860]   that I'm going to describe is work that's being done
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:21.840]   in university settings, university hospitals,
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:25.820]   by scientists and psychiatrists.
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:28.240]   And these are clinical studies, clinical trials,
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.360]   leading to peer-reviewed data.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:33.200]   And those are the data that we'll be discussing.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:36.480]   Some of the major luminaries in this area include,
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.360]   of course, aren't limited to,
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.940]   but include people like Matthew Johnson,
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:40.320]   who's at Johns Hopkins.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:41.660]   We'll discuss some of his work now.
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:44.460]   And fortunate to say that he will be coming on the podcast
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:47.120]   as a guest to describe the studies
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:49.320]   in a variety of laboratories,
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:52.700]   working on a variety of different psychedelic compounds.
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:55.660]   But let's focus on psilocybin for its capacity
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:59.300]   to rewire neural circuits and alleviate depression.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.500]   There have been anecdotal data or evidence over the years
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.600]   that psilocybin has this capacity.
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.680]   How does psilocybin work?
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.580]   Well, psilocybin magic mushrooms, as it's sometimes called,
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:16.580]   mainly works on what's called the serotonin 5-H2-A receptor
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.980]   with some affinity for the 5-HT1 receptor.
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:20.820]   What does that mean?
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:22.840]   Well, basically you've got a lot of different kinds
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.000]   of serotonin receptors,
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.400]   just as you have a lot of different kinds
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.200]   of dopamine receptors or other types of receptors.
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.280]   The advantage of having different receptors
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:33.000]   expressed in different parts of the brain and body,
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.540]   even on different parts of individual cells
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:36.760]   in the brain and body,
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.640]   is that the same compound serotonin
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.920]   can have a diverse set of effects
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.540]   on different cells and tissues.
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:45.680]   This is also the basis of some of the side effect profiles
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.040]   of SSRIs, because maybe, for instance,
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.480]   we know that taking Prozac fluoxetine
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.040]   will increase serotonin in one area,
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.280]   but also in another area,
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:57.500]   and then they will go have diverse effects
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:58.780]   on different brain circuits
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:00.860]   because of the variety of receptors.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:02.840]   Receptors are just like parking slots
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.000]   where the molecule serotonin parks
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.500]   and has different effects.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:11.500]   Well, psilocybin engages or increases serotonin transmission,
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:15.400]   meaning it increases the amount of serotonin,
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:18.980]   mainly by acting at these 5-H2-A receptors,
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.200]   but where in the brain does it happen
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.400]   and what are the major effects?
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.840]   First, let's talk about the major effects,
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.100]   'cause I think that's what people are interested in.
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:27.600]   The study that I'd like to highlight
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:28.940]   is a fairly recent one.
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:34.920]   It was published in May of 2021 in Journal of the American
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:39.440]   Medical Association Psychiatry, so JAMA Psychiatry,
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.360]   and it's entitled "Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:45.800]   "on Major Depressive Disorder, a Randomized Clinical Trial."
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.040]   It's an absolutely beautiful study, a very important study.
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.120]   It includes some of the luminaries in this area,
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:54.440]   like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finnan, Roland Griffiths,
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:57.140]   and others, we will provide a link to this study.
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:02.080]   It is available in its full form at zero cost
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:02.920]   if you want to read it.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:03.840]   It's got a lot of details,
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.360]   so I'm just going to summarize a few things,
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.460]   but basically what they did was they screened for patients
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:10.380]   to come into the clinic.
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:11.420]   These were people that suffered
[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:13.820]   from major depressive disorder
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:18.820]   and administered either one or two rounds of psilocybin.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:21.620]   They used particular dosages.
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:23.260]   They're listed in the study, so you can look it up
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:25.680]   if you're really interested in that level of detail.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:29.260]   Typically, it was 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight,
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:30.780]   so it depends on body weight,
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:33.380]   or 30 milligrams of psilocybin
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:36.940]   per 70 kilograms of body weight.
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:38.120]   They were given in capsule form,
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.600]   so people weren't eating the mushrooms.
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.400]   This is obviously a very controlled study,
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.180]   and they want to control the dosages appropriately.
[01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:48.600]   They were randomized to begin the treatment immediately
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.760]   or after an eight-week delay.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.440]   They had all the appropriate control groups
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.980]   that one would like to see.
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:56.380]   What's really striking about this study
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:00.720]   is that there was a very significant improvement
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:04.340]   in mood and affect and relief from depressive symptoms
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:09.160]   in anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.100]   that were subjects in the study
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:16.100]   who received the psilocybin treatment,
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:19.840]   and whether or not it was 50 or whether or not it was 71%
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.060]   varied according to how long after the study
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:25.380]   they maintained these antidepressant effects,
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.660]   whether or not they stayed in remission from the depression,
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:31.140]   but these are really enormous and significant effects,
[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:35.620]   very exciting, and are pointing in the direction
[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:39.620]   of psilocybin very soon becoming a treatment
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.720]   for various forms of depression,
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:43.800]   including major depression.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:48.160]   Now, of course, this is limited to the laboratory at present.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:50.140]   There are a number of elements of these studies
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:51.980]   that are important to take into consideration, too,
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:55.340]   which is that there are highly trained guides,
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:58.620]   meaning people to direct people through the experience.
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.660]   As Matthew Johnson has told me,
[01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:03.600]   there is the occurrence from time to time
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.360]   of people having so-called bad trips,
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.940]   of having anxiety attacks during the hallucinations
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:10.260]   and all that, and they have ways to mitigate that
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:12.780]   and deal with that because the guides are trained.
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:16.680]   They have all the sorts of medical monitoring devices
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:18.260]   for heart rate and temperature and things
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:21.960]   that one would like to see for a study like this,
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.300]   because these are very powerful compounds.
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:26.800]   I don't want to give away any elements of the discussion
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:29.460]   with Matthew Johnson because it will be released
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:32.260]   in podcast form reasonably soon here,
[01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:33.740]   the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:35.540]   but one of the things that came up
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:37.140]   and is a fundamental question that I had
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:39.760]   that I think probably many of you are asking is,
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.780]   does the experience that one has on these compounds
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:46.480]   make a difference for whether or not somebody gains relief
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.780]   from depression from these psilocybin journeys or not?
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:52.780]   In other words, does it matter what they talk about?
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:53.900]   Does it matter what they think about?
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:55.980]   Does it matter if they have a good trip or a bad trip?
[01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:58.700]   And I don't want to hold you in too much suspense.
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.960]   I'll let Matthew provide the more thorough answer,
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.300]   but what's really interesting is there are some common themes
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:09.140]   to psilocybin administration and experience
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:11.420]   that lead to relief from depressive symptoms,
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:14.740]   but they are subjectively, excuse me,
[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:19.740]   subjectively very varied, meaning that whether or not
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:22.520]   people feel they had a good experience or a bad experience,
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.620]   whether or not people thought about their parents
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:27.420]   or thought about the color of the ceiling
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:30.140]   doesn't seem to have too much of an impact
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:34.780]   on whether or not they receive relief during these studies,
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:36.280]   in these clinical studies.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.580]   It seems like different people
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:40.160]   can have lots of different experiences
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.780]   and still receive benefit.
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:45.420]   And that points to something deeper.
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:48.180]   It points to the fact that these drugs,
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:49.800]   which is really what they are,
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:53.780]   are rewiring neural circuitry in a common way
[01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:56.980]   despite a diversity of experience while on the drug.
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:58.700]   And that itself is really interesting.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:01.100]   And it takes us back to a place that we've been before
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:04.060]   in this discussion, which is layer five of the cortex,
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:06.520]   this area that ketamine seems to impact as well
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.180]   by generating rhythms of the,
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:10.960]   I mentioned one to three Hertz activity in layer five
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:13.240]   of certain areas of the cortex.
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:17.480]   Well, the 5-HT1A receptor is known to be enriched
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:19.800]   in layer five of the cortex.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:23.540]   And layer five of the cortex is a very interesting area
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:25.100]   because it's an area in which
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.300]   there's a lot of lateral connectivity.
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:30.640]   So connections between different brain areas laterally
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.560]   generally is what allows us to merge different senses.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.020]   So for instance, when we hear a sound off to our right,
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:39.200]   over here, we turned our right,
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.000]   there's a very hardwired response.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.680]   And typically we hear something off to our right,
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:44.140]   we don't look to our left.
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:46.700]   That's how hardwired some of these circuits are.
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:49.340]   What appears to be happening is that the activation
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:53.580]   of the serotonin system in 5-HT1A receptor in layer five
[01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:57.440]   is offering up or providing an experience
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.260]   whereby the lateral connections are able to engage
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:03.820]   much more broadly than they would normally.
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:07.100]   Now that also could be a bad thing.
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:10.480]   When I asked Matt about this, that sounds kind of spooky.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.620]   I don't know that when I hear something off to my right
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:13.820]   that I want to look off to my left,
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:15.440]   that could be highly maladaptive,
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:18.460]   especially if it's a car coming at me from my right.
[01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:19.980]   That doesn't seem to be what's happening.
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:24.040]   It's not really rewiring these deeply reflexive circuits.
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:27.680]   It's somehow rewiring associations between events,
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.240]   emotional events, past events, current events,
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:33.100]   and future events in ways that allow people
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:35.720]   to get some sort of relief or distance
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.140]   from these narratives, these depressive stories
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:40.780]   about their past and present,
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.900]   and allow them to see new opportunity
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:44.460]   and optimism in the future.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:46.980]   That's really a fascinating thing
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:48.380]   if you really think about it,
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:51.220]   because I would have thought that simply
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:53.880]   by ramping up laterality of connections,
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:56.060]   meaning the cross associations,
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:59.660]   that things could either be rewired randomly
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:01.260]   in ways that don't serve us
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:04.860]   or would perhaps just cause no effect at all.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.480]   So it's either going to be bad or neutral,
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.680]   but that's not really the way things are turning out.
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:10.600]   Again, these are highly controlled studies.
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:13.140]   I do want to emphasize that ketamine, psilocybin,
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:16.460]   these things are still illegal, most all places.
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:19.160]   There are some regions and cities in the United States
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:21.420]   where they are locally decriminalized,
[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:22.560]   but they are not legal.
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.540]   They're still illegal.
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:26.500]   So what we're referring to here are indeed clinical studies
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.780]   in which people are taking them legally.
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:32.880]   I think it's very likely we will see a shift
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:35.380]   in the legislature around psychedelics
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:39.700]   and in particular psilocybin in the not too distant future.
[01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:41.420]   And I think that for now,
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:44.820]   what we should know is what Matt told me
[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:47.080]   and what you'll hear far more about,
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:51.420]   which is that psilocybin, this one,
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:54.380]   or in most cases, two dose treatments done
[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:57.580]   in a highly clinical setting, controlled setting
[01:43:57.580 --> 01:44:00.320]   with patients that are carefully selected,
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.620]   can in many cases, the majority of people receive
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:07.100]   and maintain relief from their depressive symptoms
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:11.500]   simply through the experience of this psychedelic journey.
[01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.580]   I did ask him about microdosing.
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:16.760]   I made it sound as if I had never heard about it before.
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:19.780]   Microdosing, not microdosing, microdosing.
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:22.660]   And his answer was interesting.
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:25.500]   His answer was that the microdosing effects
[01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:28.540]   don't seem to be nearly as impactful as some of these,
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:31.320]   let's just call them what they are,
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:34.500]   these kind of high amplitude sessions
[01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:37.820]   that there are just one or two.
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:40.720]   There are some studies ongoing where there's more than two,
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:43.120]   but that the microdosing doesn't seem to compare
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:47.600]   to these macrodosing, I mentioned the dosages before,
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.640]   this 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.760]   or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms,
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:55.960]   dosages given several weeks apart.
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:58.220]   So you'll hear more about microdosing
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:00.440]   and other psychedelics and their impact
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:04.200]   on depressive states and major depression
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.640]   in the episode with Matt.
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:07.880]   But for the time being, it really seems as if,
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:09.560]   again, we're looking at neuroplasticity,
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.040]   we're coming back to layer five,
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.060]   just like with ketamine and PCP,
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:14.320]   we're hearing about layer five,
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.940]   we're hearing about rewiring of circuitry,
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.800]   we're hearing about a dissociation
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:22.680]   or a distancing of oneself from these negative moods
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.000]   and affects and narratives.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.860]   But there's a key distinction between the ketamine work
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:31.500]   and the psilocybin work, which is that in the ketamine work,
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:34.580]   it really is about dissociating from experience
[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:36.820]   during the session with the psychiatrist.
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:38.760]   Whereas during the psilocybin journey,
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:41.740]   it's really about immersing oneself in the experience
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:43.860]   and being fully present to that experience.
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:45.700]   That does seem to be an important component.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.460]   And what the difference is there
[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:50.580]   and why they both seem to provide some relief
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.460]   from major depression isn't clear.
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:56.400]   I think most likely it takes us back to the fact
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.260]   that this thing we call major depression
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:03.520]   clearly involves serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:04.520]   And in some individuals,
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:07.900]   they may be more deficient in one or several of those
[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.740]   or all of those, whereas in other individuals,
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:12.200]   it might be a different collection of chemicals.
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.380]   And of course, there are a tremendous number
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:18.580]   of other psychedelic compounds that people are exploring
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:21.240]   for treatment of major depression,
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:22.600]   but really psilocybin is the one
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:24.540]   that we have the most data on.
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:29.060]   MDMA has mainly been explored in the clinical realm
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:30.260]   for treatment of trauma.
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:34.420]   There are some trials ongoing for treatment of depression,
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:38.140]   but the big breakthroughs seem to be happening
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:40.380]   in the realm of trauma treatment,
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:42.500]   the so-called MAPS group that's doing this,
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.820]   again, legally in a clinical setting.
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:45.860]   And there are other groups
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:47.260]   that are starting to do it as well.
[01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:50.740]   We are going to do an entire podcast episode about MDMA
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:52.180]   and some related compounds.
[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:54.560]   So I'll save that discussion for then.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:57.320]   One of the most common questions I get for this podcast
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:00.720]   is about different diets, different regimes,
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.460]   different nutritional plans, things like keto,
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:07.980]   ketogenic diet, or vegan diets, or intermittent fasting,
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:11.760]   or the all meat diet, the so-called lion diet, et cetera.
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:14.360]   There are actually really interesting data
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:18.720]   relating nutrition and diet to major depressive disorder.
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:21.660]   And I think we just need to frame this
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:23.560]   by returning to something that was said earlier,
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:26.700]   which is that the ingestion of carbohydrates,
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:29.660]   in particular carbohydrates and some meats like turkey
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:34.660]   that are rich in tryptophan, this precursor to serotonin,
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:39.660]   are in many ways the self-medicating version
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.700]   of depression treatment.
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:44.300]   Now, to be clear, I'm not saying that people should use food
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:46.100]   to medicate their depression.
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:48.300]   Many people do that reflexively, however,
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:50.240]   they reach for carbohydrate-rich foods
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:53.420]   to blunt their cortisol, because that's indeed what it does.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:56.080]   It blunts cortisol when you ingest high carbohydrate foods,
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.720]   in particular starchy foods.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:01.760]   And it does increase serotonin, in particular,
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:06.760]   if those foods rather are rich in the amino acid tryptophan.
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:10.320]   Now, ingesting food is wonderful and important and great,
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.380]   but ingesting excessive foods of any kinds,
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:16.420]   carbohydrate or otherwise is not healthy, of course.
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:19.200]   There have been some explorations
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:20.660]   of whether or not a vegan diet
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:23.100]   can improve symptoms of depression.
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:25.460]   Not a lot of data, not impressive data.
[01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:27.700]   There have been very few controlled studies
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:31.100]   looking at the carnivore all-meat diet.
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:32.700]   On that, I think there are now some
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:34.020]   that are starting to spin up,
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:35.540]   meaning the studies are starting to spin up.
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:39.140]   However, the ketogenic diet has been explored
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:44.140]   for its ability to relieve certain symptoms of depression,
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:49.140]   in particular to what's called maintained euthymia,
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:51.820]   Euthymia is the kind of state of equilibrium
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:55.020]   between a manic episode and a depressive episode
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:56.340]   in a manic bipolar person.
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:58.200]   We'll return to this more in a future episode.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.680]   But basically, manics have highs and they have lows.
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:04.320]   Bipolars either cycle back and forth really quickly,
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.360]   so rapid cycling, bipolars or slope, some people.
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.200]   So really quickly can be day-to-day.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:11.100]   Other people, it's month-to-month or week-to-week,
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:13.460]   they're going highs and lows.
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:16.040]   And you hear about mania and you hear about dysphoria.
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.160]   Euthymia is that kind of place in the middle
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:22.840]   where people feel neither too high nor too low.
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:25.180]   And there are some interesting studies
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:26.840]   looking at the ketogenic diet
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:29.720]   for maintaining euthymia in manic depressives,
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:32.520]   but also in people with major depressive disorder.
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.600]   Why would this work?
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.600]   Well, we have to remember that the ketogenic diet
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:41.420]   wasn't discovered so that self-appointed nutrition gurus
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:43.160]   could talk about it online
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:46.440]   or so that people could make money selling anything
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.000]   related to ketosis.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]   And here I'm not disparaging of the ketogenic diets,
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.320]   helped a lot of people.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.180]   The ketogenic diet was actually shown to be medically
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:58.860]   relevant for its use to treat epilepsy.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:02.800]   It turns out that in epilepsy
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.280]   or in particular pediatric epilepsy,
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.580]   that a ketogenic diet and the shift of brain metabolism
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:12.840]   to predominantly one in which ketones are being metabolized
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:17.680]   rather than more standard glucose type metabolism
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.780]   can greatly reduce the number of epileptic seizures
[01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:22.720]   that these children experience.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.560]   It's not always the case, but it's often the case.
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:27.320]   And so you talk to a neurologist or a neurosurgeon
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:31.320]   who's specialized in epilepsy
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.880]   and particular pediatric epilepsy,
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.140]   and they'll tell you this,
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:36.480]   oh yeah, the ketogenic diet in many cases,
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:38.740]   not all can be very effective for this treatment.
[01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:43.600]   How, how is it that a ketogenic diet reduces seizures?
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:46.380]   Well, the way it reduces seizures
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:49.940]   is by increasing what's called GABA transmission.
[01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:54.260]   GABA is a substance that is naturally released in our brain.
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:56.380]   It's an inhibitory neurotransmitter,
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:58.980]   meaning that when it's released into the synapse,
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:01.700]   it has the tendency to reduce the firing,
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:04.700]   to reduce the electrical activity of the next neuron
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:06.000]   or sets of neurons.
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:09.500]   There are various compounds that increase GABA,
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:10.900]   in particular, GABA in the forebrain.
[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:14.540]   One common example would be something like alcohol.
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:16.900]   Drinking alcoholic drink or two
[01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:20.380]   will increase GABA transmission will ironically,
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:22.980]   will lower your social inhibitions
[01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:25.980]   by increasing your neurochemical inhibition.
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:30.020]   It basically suppresses the self-monitoring pathways.
[01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:32.440]   And if people drink enough, it will suppress all pathways
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.840]   and people will urinate themselves and fall over.
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:37.480]   It will eventually inhibit all sorts of pathways.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:41.240]   So the GABA system has a rich array of effects
[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:42.920]   all over the brain and body,
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:47.160]   but alcohol tends to activate the release of GABA.
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:49.520]   You might say, well, then why not just take alcohol
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:50.360]   to suppress seizures?
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:51.500]   Well, that would be a terrible idea
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:54.040]   because there tends to be a rebound excitability
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:57.680]   after alcohol stops having its effects
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:58.880]   on the GABA receptors.
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.680]   And so then there's an excitability
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:03.120]   for which an epilepsy would be terrible.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:07.120]   The reason why the epileptic diet is useful for epilepsy
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.720]   is that increases the, what we call the tonic level,
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:13.840]   the sort of the tide, the level of GABA in the brain.
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:16.580]   And that suppresses some of the hyperexcitability
[01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:20.160]   that is the characteristic feature of epilepsy.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:21.880]   And there are other drugs, for instance,
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:26.600]   the benzodiazepines and things of the Xanax variety,
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:30.080]   Valium and so forth, those increase GABA transmission.
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:32.100]   Those drugs also have a lot of potential
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:34.000]   for abuse and addiction, et cetera.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.960]   And they're problematic for other reasons.
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:38.620]   But the ketogenic diet,
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:40.900]   by way of increasing ketone metabolism
[01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:44.560]   or shifting brain's metabolism over to ketones,
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:49.560]   tends to modulate GABA such that GABA is more active
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:54.000]   and adjust the so-called GABA glutamate balance.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000]   This is getting technical,
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.060]   but glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter,
[01:52:58.060 --> 01:52:59.760]   GABA is inhibitory neurotransmitter,
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.480]   and their balance is vital for neuroplasticity,
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.640]   for maintaining healthy levels of activity
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:06.800]   in the brain, et cetera.
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:10.120]   And so there is decent evidence
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:13.340]   that people with major depressive disorders,
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:17.160]   in particular, the people with major depressive disorders
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:20.760]   that are refractory, meaning they don't respond
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:25.600]   to classical antidepressants, can benefit, it seems,
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:28.820]   from the ketogenic diet.
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:30.240]   Now, this is not always the case,
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:31.600]   but for those of you out there
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.840]   who are struggling with major depression
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.080]   and for which drugs have not worked,
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:36.380]   please talk to your psychiatrist.
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:38.360]   I don't know how many of them are up on the literature
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:42.840]   about the ketogenic diet or the EPAs and the rest.
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:45.480]   Psychiatrists vary in terms of how involved
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.420]   in the current literature they tend to be,
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:49.880]   but there are many excellent psychiatrists out there.
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.320]   Most of them, in my experience,
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:55.840]   are actually quite avid learners about what's happening
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:59.260]   and what's new in this realm that they call psychiatry.
[01:53:59.260 --> 01:54:02.980]   So it's really interesting that eating in a particular way,
[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:06.520]   lowering carbohydrates to the point where you rely
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:10.480]   on ketogenic metabolism in the brain increases GABA
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:13.780]   and can provide some relief for depressive symptoms.
[01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:16.860]   And that in particular, that seems to have positive effects
[01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:18.100]   in people that are refractory
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:21.040]   or don't respond to classic antidepressants.
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:24.060]   And that would include things like fluoxetine, et cetera.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:26.700]   I'll make one final point about ketogenic diets
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:27.920]   and GABA and depression,
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:31.720]   which is that it's also been shown that for people
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.800]   that respond well to these drugs
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:37.260]   that impact the serotonin system, dopamine system,
[01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:40.460]   or norepinephrine, the ketogenic diet there
[01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:44.380]   may improve the ability for those drugs
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:45.580]   to work at lower dosages,
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:47.040]   which is reminiscent of what we saw
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.120]   with the EPA supplementation.
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:51.820]   So today we've covered what at least feels to me
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:53.820]   like a tremendous amount of material.
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.540]   This topic of depression is indeed an enormous topic
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:58.160]   to try and get our arms around.
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.500]   We talked about the symptomology,
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:01.420]   we talked about some of the underlying neurochemistry
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:04.120]   and biology, and then we talked about approaches
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:06.200]   to deal with it that are really grounded
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:08.700]   in the neurochemistry and biology.
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:11.480]   I just want to recap a few of those tools
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.780]   and what those things are.
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:16.340]   First of all, we talked about making the effort
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:19.080]   to not overwhelm the pleasure system.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:20.620]   That might seem counterintuitive,
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:22.660]   to not overly seek out pleasure
[01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:26.500]   or else one can find themselves in a place of depression.
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:29.020]   I mentioned way back at the beginning of the episode,
[01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:32.720]   a young man who I know to be really struggling
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:36.020]   with depression and it is thought,
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:37.460]   and we don't know for sure,
[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:39.220]   but it is thought that some of that depression
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:42.620]   was probably triggered by an overindulgence in video games
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:45.380]   and other highly dopaminergic activities
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:47.100]   to the point where those activities
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:50.440]   eventually were countered by the pain balance
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.680]   that Dr. Analemke described.
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:57.140]   And he now has to do those activities repeatedly
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:00.040]   and for many, many hours each day just to feel okay,
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:02.400]   not even to derive pleasure from them.
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:05.960]   And worse, many other activities,
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:09.520]   practically all other activities have lost their zest,
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:10.700]   they've lost their excitement
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:13.040]   and his sense of pleasure for them.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.920]   And so there's a really active campaign now
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:17.820]   to reset that system.
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:22.020]   So number one, don't overwhelm your pleasure centers
[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:24.060]   either through activities or compounds.
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:25.400]   It might seem counterintuitive,
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:28.540]   but you're setting yourself up for anhedonia and depression
[01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:29.380]   if you do that.
[01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:31.000]   It's not just about addiction, that too,
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.280]   but it's also about setting yourself
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:35.160]   for anhedonia and depression.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:37.460]   How often can you engage in these activities?
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:39.400]   Well, that's going to differ from person to person,
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.880]   everyone's slightly different,
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:43.480]   but you should really mind your extreme highs
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:46.260]   and your extreme lows and be cautious about those.
[01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:49.200]   We'll probably have Dr. Lemke on again in a future time
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:51.300]   to try and get some more specifics about that.
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:54.640]   But if you do feel like you need to reset that system,
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:58.940]   it really does seem like a 30-day complete detox
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:01.120]   from whatever activity or substance that is,
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:03.840]   and ideally it doesn't continue after that 30 days,
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:06.880]   especially in conditions of drugs of abuse.
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:10.080]   Second of all, talked about the norepinephrine system
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.880]   and how the norepinephrine system is really deficient
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.740]   in many forms of major depression and in depression.
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:20.540]   There is now more deliberate pursuit
[01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:23.080]   of norepinephrine-inducing activities that are healthy,
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:26.260]   that aren't adrenaline-seeking per se,
[01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:27.500]   things like cold showers,
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:31.520]   things like particular patterns of breathing
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:35.260]   that engage and tend to make us more alert,
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:37.580]   things like exercise that will increase
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:39.140]   our levels of noradrenaline.
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:42.040]   I'd be remiss if I said that these activities
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:45.340]   could completely eliminate depressive symptoms
[01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:46.860]   in people with major depressive disorder.
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:47.860]   I don't think that's the case.
[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:48.860]   And again, I want to acknowledge
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:50.900]   that people with major depressive symptoms
[01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:53.960]   often don't have the energy, the willingness,
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:57.120]   or the capacity to engage in some of these activities,
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:00.020]   but things like cold showers, deliberate cold showers,
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:02.300]   things like regular exercise,
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:05.140]   they aren't just feel-good activities.
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:07.460]   They actually engage the norepinephrine system
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:09.140]   and keep that system tuned up
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:11.740]   and allow us to increase our norepinephrine levels at will
[01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:13.020]   on a regular basis.
[01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:15.420]   And their mood-enhancing effects are real effects
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:17.840]   that at the level of neurochemistry.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:20.200]   Then we talked about EPAs, these essential fatty acids,
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:23.080]   and it's clear that for most people,
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:24.880]   getting above 1,000 milligrams
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:28.280]   and probably even closer to 2,000 milligrams per day of EPAs
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.500]   can be beneficial for mood,
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:31.840]   especially in attempts to treat
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:34.640]   or offset major depressive disorder.
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.600]   Are there side effects?
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:37.820]   Well, you need to explore those for yourself
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:38.640]   and with your doctor.
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:41.340]   Everyone has a different health background.
[01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:43.860]   You know, for the margins of safety for most people
[01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:45.880]   will probably be quite large,
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:48.500]   but for some people that might not be the case.
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:50.960]   So definitely check with your physician.
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:52.360]   We also talked about exercise
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:54.820]   and how EPA and exercise on a regular basis
[01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:57.140]   can offset these inflammatory pathways.
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:58.580]   I want to mention something I've mentioned
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:58:59.680]   on a previous podcast,
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:02.100]   but in terms of keeping the inflammatome,
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:04.300]   all these molecules that create inflammation
[01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:07.020]   and then the inflammation can limit the amount of serotonin
[01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:08.640]   through the pathways we described.
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:12.720]   In order to do that, it's also very, very useful
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:16.040]   to ingest two to four servings of fermented foods
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:17.920]   on a daily basis or near daily basis.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:19.920]   These are data that were published by the Sonnenberg Lab
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:22.040]   at Stanford recently in the journal Cell,
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:24.240]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:27.600]   that ingestion of these fermented foods
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:31.360]   really keeps the gut microbiome tuned up, so to speak,
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:34.160]   well in order to offset these inflammatory cytokines,
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:35.780]   keeping inflammation at bay.
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:38.040]   It just turns out to be a really good thing
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:40.760]   in order to keep our mood in a good place.
[01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:42.640]   So EPA, exercise, fermented foods,
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:45.860]   creatine as a potential source of relief from depression
[01:59:45.860 --> 01:59:49.320]   or offsetting or keeping us away from major depression
[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:50.840]   or relapse into depression.
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:53.600]   And then we talked about the prescription compounds
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:55.080]   and the compounds that are being used
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:56.540]   mainly in the course of studies
[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:58.500]   and of psychiatry and depression,
[01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:01.680]   things like ketamine, PCP, psilocybin and related compounds.
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:03.480]   And then lastly, we talked about ketosis,
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:04.940]   which may not be right for everybody,
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:08.060]   but might be right for certain individuals out there
[02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:09.460]   who are grappling with this.
[02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:11.940]   If you're learning from this podcast

[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:05.420]   Throughout the course of today's episode
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:08.260]   and in previous episodes, I mentioned supplements
[02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:10.540]   that may be appropriate for you.
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:12.860]   If you want to check out the supplements that I take,

[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:22.360]   That's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman.
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.220]   There, you can see the supplements I take.
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:27.220]   If you want to try any of those supplements,
[02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:29.160]   you can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:32.000]   And if you navigate from that location in the website
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.960]   to any other locations in the Thorne site,
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:36.640]   you will also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:37.820]   that Thorne makes.
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:38.860]   We partnered with Thorne
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:41.100]   because they have the absolutely highest levels
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.940]   of stringency in terms of the quality and quantity
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:47.380]   of the supplements that they put in their formulations.
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:48.540]   And last but not least,
[02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:50.940]   I want to thank you for embarking on this journey
[02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:53.140]   of trying to understand what is depression,
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:55.460]   how does it work, and how to treat it.
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:57.460]   And thank you for your interest in science.
