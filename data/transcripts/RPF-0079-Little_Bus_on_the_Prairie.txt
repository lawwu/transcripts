[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:42.440]   What's it actually like to live in a converted school bus with three small children while you're saving money to build a house?
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:01:04.440]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for today, Friday, October the 10th, 2014.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.440]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:18.440]   Today, contrary to what I said yesterday, I'm not going to be bringing you a show on education, but rather bringing you a show which is an interview with Sarah and Noah,
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:26.440]   who are currently living in a converted bus with their three children while they try to figure out how to build their new house out in California.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.440]   A fun adventure, so to speak.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.220]   The show today, I think you're really gonna enjoy it because it's gonna be a little bit
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.940]   different than many of the shows that I have played previously.
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.060]   Now, let me be specific and give you a quick note of introduction here.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.460]   Today's show is very chatty, and it's more of kind of two new friends getting to know
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.700]   each other over a Skype connection on a late at night telephone call.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.940]   So, it's very chatty and it's not specifically point point point point on here's what you
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.420]   should do; here's what you should do; here's what you should do.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.700]   If that's going to annoy you, flip forward or flip backwards to another show and don't
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700]   bother with this.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.740]   But I think that you may, many of you will still enjoy this kind of show.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.420]   It's a little bit different.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.620]   And you'll benefit, I think, from knowing a little bit on the background.
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.740]   So I've been interested for years in bus conversions, and I've always watched online at different
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.380]   people converting school buses to live in and people living in RVs.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.380]   I think it's a pretty cool financial strategy for some people.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.180]   So I was Googling around and found a website called Little Bus on the Prairie and was impressed
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.500]   that there was this family of mother and father, so a family of five, and three small children
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   that was living in a bus.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.300]   And I shot off an email and set up an interview.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.260]   Now it was actually, I arranged the interview, I think, probably about a month before I actually
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.340]   did it.
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.940]   And so there was a lot of time that had passed.
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.020]   And usually, generally, oftentimes, I'm very much a person who's expecting someone to say,
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.020]   "Hey, this is great.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.140]   We're loving our alternative lifestyle.
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.020]   We love living off-grid and doing this."
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.020]   Whatever this thing is.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.060]   That's how my mind works.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.620]   But I recognize that's not reality.
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.700]   And what happened was a fascinating peek into what it's actually like sometimes to scrimp
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.700]   and save.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.660]   And sometimes the radical side is maybe really challenging.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.140]   It's not so necessarily so easy.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.060]   So I think this story is going to be a very interesting story, which you may enjoy.
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.460]   And in speaking with Sarah and Noah, they had just come off of three days with triple-digit
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.340]   temperatures with them being on a bus with three small children.
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.700]   And that is a challenge.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.700]   And Sarah is very pregnant with a baby expected soon.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.060]   I think it's a month or two, something like that.
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.420]   And so it was neat to kind of capture some of that emotion, but it wasn't what I was
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.460]   necessarily expecting in the interview.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.260]   The other thing that's interesting about this interview is that Sarah and Noah are an everyday
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.860]   normal couple just simply trying to work their dreams.
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.100]   In fact, as we were emailing before the interview, they were very clear and kind of a little
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.940]   bit surprised that I'd reached out to them and saying, "We're not millionaires.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.080]   We're just trying to kind of figure things out."
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.900]   So instead of today bringing you an expert on something, rather we bring you a conversation
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.120]   between a couple of people who are just working to figure things out.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.380]   And I think you'll enjoy that.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.020]   And so the first part of this interview, the interview is about 54, just under 54 minutes
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.020]   long.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.720]   The first part of the interview is talking about the bus living, the story of how they
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.320]   wound up in a bus.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.060]   The middle part is talking a little bit about what it's been like as far as them trying
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.900]   to figure out how to build a house, how to build a house that would be affordable, that
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.140]   would work and actually work for their family and the location that they have.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.460]   And they're having some real challenges in making that happen.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.380]   You can read on their blog some more details about the challenges that they're having.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.140]   And then kind of the final third is a little bit on education as far as I noticed that
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.460]   they were educating their kids and I was interested in why because that's a subject of interest
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.460]   to me.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.820]   And I think it's also a subject that has a lot of applicability to personal finance.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.780]   I had a comment on the blog from yesterday's show that seemed to indicate that maybe the
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.540]   connection between education and personal finance was not exactly clear.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.900]   And this show is absolutely dedicated to personal finance.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.420]   We're not going to spend all our time on education, but I think it is actually an incredibly important
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.420]   aspect of personal finance.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.440]   And on the next show, I will bring out some of the details as to why I think the connection
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.640]   is so strong and why I think it really matters.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.100]   But I won't do that anymore for today.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.740]   So enjoy today's episode.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.980]   Enjoy listening and hearing from Sarah and Noah.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.260]   And I think it is a much needed refresher to a lot of times the world that I live in
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.340]   about everything is great about living a radical lifestyle.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.380]   Sometimes living in a bus is not so fun.
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.100]   Sometimes you're really, really ready to be in the house.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.820]   Enjoy the interview.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.660]   So Sarah and Noah, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.060]   I appreciate you making time to chat with me tonight.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.060]   Sure.
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.260]   Yeah, it's good to be here.
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.900]   So I've been looking forward to talking with you and I'm interested in just simply having
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.940]   a conversation and hearing a little bit about your story.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.300]   The way that I found you is that I was out browsing around on the interwebs one day and
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.140]   I was looking for, I've always been interested in bus conversions.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.420]   I always thought it was cool when people would buy these old school buses and convert them
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.100]   into an RV, it's like a cheap RV.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.580]   I'm not sure if you guys, I would imagine you probably have seen a lot of that.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.700]   But I've always been fascinated by people who've done that and just some of the craftsmanship.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.540]   And then I was looking, I was wondering if anyone was living on a bus and that was how
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.940]   I came across your website called Little Bus on the Prairie.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.420]   So what I would love to do is share with me just a little bit, what's your background
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.860]   and how did you wind up living in a bus?
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:14.860]   Well, the bus itself is a 1970 international school bus and we found it on Craigslist.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.900]   It was already converted, it had already had the second story added on and we found it
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:28.020]   on Craigslist for, if you can believe it, only a thousand dollars.
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.180]   And then we had already purchased an RV that we were planning on living out here in and
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.380]   my husband sent the Craigslist listing to me as a joke.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.380]   Totally joking.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:46.340]   And I was like, yes, let's do that instead.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.300]   How much were you going to spend on the RV?
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:55.540]   Well, we had already purchased an RV for, I think it was 22,000 or 2,500.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.100]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:04.780]   We still have the RV too and we just never use it.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:10.140]   It's kind of like Ishmael, it wasn't the chosen vehicle.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.420]   So that seems odd to me.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.260]   You have them both, why did the bus win?
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.260]   How did you end up with the bus?
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:24.100]   The bus, it had a lot more space for one thing because it does have the upper story with
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.300]   the upper living space.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.300]   She couldn't have a blog called Little Bus on the Prairie with an RV.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.220]   There's nothing exciting about that story.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.700]   I never would have found you, right?
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:41.140]   If it were just a little RV on the prairie, I never would have found you in my searching.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:48.380]   Just me personally, my family, my dad actually, since I was little, has had several buses
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.980]   that he's actually converted himself.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.980]   Really?
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.340]   Yeah, a little bit of a bus affinity, I suppose.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.820]   So you know all about that.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.140]   I've never seen one in person.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.740]   I've only just read them.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.940]   I've looked at people's photos of them on the internet.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.420]   So you've got quite a history in the bus conversion space.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.780]   Yeah, I remember helping my dad when I was little going out and drilling cabinets and
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.780]   stuff.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.140]   But yeah, we've done that forever.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.580]   It seems like an incredibly massive amount of work, frankly.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.820]   Every time I've ever looked at them, I've said, "Wow, there are some amazing craftspeople
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.100]   that have put together some amazing projects."
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.380]   My dad has put a lot of work into it.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.940]   We didn't convert this one ourselves.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:42.740]   It was already pre-converted, but Noah did a lot and family members and all came and
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.620]   really updated everything.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.980]   It was really gnarly inside.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:52.860]   It had carpet that was probably 20 years old and everything was mildewy and it was really,
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.460]   really gross inside.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:04.180]   So what were the circumstances that led to your actually wanting to live in the bus?
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:15.260]   Well, it kind of goes back to when we were first looking back in 2012.
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:23.620]   We were looking for a house to buy and everything back in 2012 was priced really, really low.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.980]   All the houses that we were interested in kept getting snatched up by investors.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:36.340]   Noah, when he was a kid, built a house with his parents out of adobe out in Arizona.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.980]   He'd always wanted to build his own house as an adult.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:47.700]   So we started looking at vacant land and we found the land that we were on that we eventually
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.700]   wound up buying.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.060]   It was just a steal of a deal.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:59.540]   Once we started looking into what building a house would entail and the fact that it's
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:06.420]   very, very expensive, I think that we just kind of, both of us were like, "All right,
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:14.060]   if this is the route we're going to take and this is the path, then we need to be able
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.940]   to afford it."
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:21.980]   It's really difficult to afford interest payments on a construction loan and pay rent at the
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.980]   same time.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:31.580]   So it was the idea though must have come from your dad's, did the idea come from the fact
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.740]   that your dad had done various bus conversions?
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.580]   It's just the reason I'm asking is it's not most people, many people that I've worked
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.780]   with, if you want to build a house and you're living in an apartment, you just continue
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.380]   as is and you just borrow a little extra money.
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.680]   It's really not that big a deal.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.920]   Most people that I've worked with don't often say, "How can I again move into a bus?"
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.240]   Was it the fact that your dad had done it or does this just seem like a good idea you
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   guys came up with?
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.240]   Yeah, I don't think, I think it was just a good idea.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:07.120]   We kind of thought it was going to be an adventure and a little more exciting.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.080]   We had to be out on the property and kind of see it.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   We also thought the process was going to go much smoother and faster.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.640]   But yeah, it seemed like it was going to be interesting.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.240]   So what's great about it and what stinks about it?
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.840]   It's probably not the best time to ask.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:36.440]   We just got off a couple weeks of triple digit heat wave out here and I am about eight months
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:41.200]   along in my fourth pregnancy.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   So the good things have, the bloom is off the road.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   Right.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.000]   There is a lot of fun stuff.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.920]   I mean, being out here with the kids, there's plenty of stuff to run around and do and power
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.400]   wheels and quads and all that kind of stuff.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400]   That's a lot of fun.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:05.760]   As far as being in the bus, I think the funnest part is staying outside of it.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:13.680]   So this is actually what I was interested in because what happens is that we as a society,
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.640]   we tend to spend most of our time writing and talking about things that are awesome.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:29.720]   And so if you were to guess just by the internet memes that go around, then you would assume
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.560]   that living in buses is awesome.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.320]   Living full time in RVs is just the way to live.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.720]   Tiny houses are practically just the greatest gift from heaven, allowing you to get rid
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.000]   of all your stuff.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.200]   And just these kind of wild and radical and crazy things are, again, awesome.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.000]   And that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.400]   I think that they can be awesome adventures, but yet I think I take a little more realistic
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:05.760]   view and I could imagine your bus doesn't have air conditioning, is that right?
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   No.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.760]   Right.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:15.400]   So triple digit temperatures in your eighth month of pregnancy, that would be a challenging
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   couple of weeks.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   I certainly recognize that.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.680]   Essentially, we're in a tin can which reflects the heat.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.400]   But yeah, there's a lot of people at work that kind of know what I'm doing and the conversation
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.920]   about tiny houses and minimalist living and all that kind of stuff comes up quite a bit
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:38.760]   because they think that that's kind of my mentality and it's not.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.560]   So I think it kind of seems like a romantic kind of thing.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.680]   I think people kind of put a lot of emotion into it and it's a nice thought.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.720]   But in reality, it's hard.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.320]   I mean, I think your circumstances are different.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.720]   With three kids, a small space becomes very, very small.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.720]   I think the thought of it gets a lot of people excited, but actually getting down to it,
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.640]   it kind of rubs off quick.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.960]   It's so interesting that you say that though about the internet and all that kind of stuff
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:18.640]   because when we first embarked upon this journey, I was totally taken in by that.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.920]   I was actually just writing a post the other day.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.960]   It's hard to put into words because I feel very disillusioned by the allure of small
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.040]   space living.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.960]   We're living without 80% of our belongings right now.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.840]   It's all in storage.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.360]   Although we have less stuff, we also have less space.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.720]   On the one hand, there is the appeal that it's like we have all the stuff that's gone
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.560]   and I don't, for the most part, miss it.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.960]   I kind of miss my blender.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.440]   So on the one hand, I can see that totally.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.400]   You don't need nearly as much stuff as you think that you do, but on the other hand,
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.720]   trying to cram even 20% of your stuff into a smaller space with three children and being
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:14.120]   pregnant, it's not ideal.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.800]   Have you done any traveling with your bus?
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   Is it mobile?
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.480]   There's some kind of problem with the radiator, which would probably be an easy fix, but we
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.640]   drove from where we lived to where we picked up the bus.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:37.240]   It's probably 40 or 50 miles and it took us almost eight hours.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.880]   So it's not the most effective means of transportation.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.880]   I would guess not.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:49.280]   But that's another thing, too, that lately I've been thinking so much about because like
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:54.720]   you said, there are so many blogs out there about living in an RV and I stumbled upon
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.080]   this blog that was linked to on another blog or whatever about this Tickner family.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.800]   I think it's like T-I-C-N-O-R, TicknerTribe.com.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.000]   And they have 12 kids and now they're down to nine or whatever and they all travel across
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   the US.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Is that what happened to the Tickner family?
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.760]   Yeah, they grew up and moved on and they're off doing their own thing now.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.760]   So they have the nine youngest.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   Right, they're the nine youngest.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:30.480]   And like you said, they write about it and they're so exuberant about it and this is
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.840]   just the best life and all this stuff.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.360]   And then looking at their space, they're in a brand new RV.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.440]   Not brand new, I shouldn't say that, but it's much newer than 1970.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.560]   You know, they're in a new RV with slide outs and they've got TVs and they've got couches.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.880]   Even though I'm sure it's a super small space and they've got a ton more kids than I do
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.560]   and they're also mobile, too.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.440]   They're moving from place to place to place.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.320]   And I think I read that they have like a 15 passenger van that follows along with their
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.760]   RV and all that kind of stuff.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.760]   So it's like every situation is totally different.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.640]   They have more kids but a newer space and they're mobile.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:21.840]   And we're in a much older vehicle, I guess, with smaller kids but I'm also pregnant and
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.280]   we're just kind of stuck out here in the heat.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.640]   And then I had another reader of the blog had emailed me and it was just her and her
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.880]   husband and they were going to be moving into an RV, just the two of them while they built
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.880]   a house.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.880]   Same kind of situation.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.880]   I think it was out in the Midwest somewhere.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.880]   And she was like, "Do you have any suggestions?
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   What was the hardest thing?"
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.760]   And it was like it's a completely different situation.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.920]   You know, again, like a newer RV, just the two of them.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.960]   I think they had a couple of dogs.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.240]   And it was like, "You guys are going to be fine.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240]   You're great.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.240]   That's golden."
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:00.160]   You know, a lot of the challenges that we're facing have to do with our particular situation.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.160]   Right?
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.800]   Also, probably because you're in something of a transition between lifestyles.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.400]   And my wife and I learned this when we first got married.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:17.280]   And when we first got married and after getting married, we moved in together.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:24.840]   We lived in a studio apartment that was a total of 243 square feet.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.800]   And it was really small but we loved it.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.640]   It was just the two of us.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.360]   And it was just, again, a studio.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   One large room.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.920]   One medium-sized room.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.760]   And a very small kitchen and a bathroom.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.380]   And everything worked great about it.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.840]   It was right in the middle of downtown West Palm Beach.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.360]   It was super cheap rent.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.960]   We could walk to the beach.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.320]   Sometimes we could easily walk to the downtown areas.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.080]   It was just a perfect...
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.040]   My wife could walk to work or ride her bike to work.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.360]   I needed to drive still to my job.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.760]   But it was just a super great living circumstance.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:11.840]   And what I observed was that in the first couple of days of my being there, it felt
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.400]   really claustrophobic.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.460]   It felt really physically small.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:22.520]   But after about three or four or five days, it just felt like this is what we do.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.040]   And then when we moved out of that little tiny apartment into the massive, I don't know,
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.640]   not massive, but I guess 2,000 square foot house or something like that that we live
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.800]   in now, it felt massive for a couple of days.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.160]   And then it just felt normal.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.920]   So I noticed that we adjusted quickly.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.480]   But the thing that was the most frustrating about being in the studio was that we knew
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.020]   it was a transition time.
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.380]   We knew this wasn't a permanent lifestyle.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.960]   And we had certain lifestyle factors.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.520]   What do you do with the snorkel gear?
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.520]   Do you keep it?
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.520]   Do you get rid of it?
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520]   What do you do with the ski gear?
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.520]   Do you keep it?
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.520]   Do you get rid of it?
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.400]   What do you do with all of this gear, this stuff that just goes with life?
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.240]   What do you do with your book collection?
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.240]   Do you keep it?
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   Do you get rid of it?
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.460]   If you were going to live in a bus forever, you would probably downsize a lot of those
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.480]   things that you needed in order to make it work.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.200]   But if it's just a transition time, then you're kind of caught with the lifestyle that fits
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.280]   into a house that doesn't fit into a bus.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.880]   And that was just my observation is that the people who seem to, I would say, kind of live
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:32.040]   those lifestyles most successfully and with the greatest joy, it's because it's not for
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.400]   the purpose of glorifying living in a tiny house.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.440]   It's what that tiny house opens up for them.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:44.120]   It gives them an opportunity to experience something they wouldn't otherwise have the
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.120]   opportunity to experience.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.040]   Or if you're living in an RV because you're traveling, that's a very different thing than
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.240]   if you're just living in an RV because that's what you do.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.400]   I think that's a really good point.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.240]   If you're dropping your baggage and getting on the road or doing whatever you're doing,
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.880]   that's a really different situation.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:06.400]   I think that's, you're looking for a freedom there.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.440]   You're able to kind of do that.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:15.200]   If we were looking at this as a long-term thing, then I think, well for one, mentally
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.000]   I think you prepare a little bit differently.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.880]   And like you're saying, you make different decisions to get rid of some of that gear
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.640]   and pass that stuff on or whatever you're going to do as opposed to, yeah, the transition
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.800]   area is kind of what makes it more difficult because you're kind of caught in between,
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.560]   you know, this is only temporary.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.400]   And I've noticed that with getting utilities out here and running water and getting hot
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.440]   water going and my solar panels and all that, it's always kind of with the caveat that,
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.440]   well it's temporary.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.160]   I'm going to have to take all this down.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:52.440]   So if it's a more permanent fixture, I think you can kind of dig in a little more.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440]   And you can customize.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.080]   You can customize things more to a permanent lifestyle.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:02.360]   Like as far as even making things comfortable, there are things that we've talked about where
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.160]   it's like, well is it worth it to do that?
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.680]   If it's only going to be for this long, is it worth the money and the time investment?
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.640]   Those kinds of things to where it's kind of a difficult tradeoff sometimes.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.640]   Right.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.560]   If you're not going to be somewhere for a long period of time, there seems to be little
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.080]   sense in putting a lot of effort into improving it.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.040]   But I mean there's still the thought in my mind that's like, alright, well how can I
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.040]   make this work?
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.400]   You know, like if we don't want to go into debt with this huge house, what could we do
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.040]   to really dig in here and make this work?
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:40.080]   And usually it's a pretty short thought, but it would be possible and change things up
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.320]   a bit.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.640]   So are you thinking about doing that?
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.400]   Are you going to take out a loan?
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   Are you going to kind of build the house little by little while you can?
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.800]   What are you thinking about doing?
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.400]   We've weighed a lot of options.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:59.080]   I think we're still, I mean we're so far down the path with the house.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.920]   You know, blueprints are done.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.200]   Well we thought we were a lot further along.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.760]   We just found out the other day that our contractor didn't pass the credit check.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.640]   So we're like two weeks out from closing on our construction loan and now we don't have
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.080]   a general contractor.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.680]   Ooh, bummer.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.840]   So you know, some interesting thoughts go through your head.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.440]   I think we're still going to stay the course and do the loan.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.880]   With the kids and everything, I think we've talked about it and that's kind of the lifestyle
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.600]   we want to have for them to grow up in.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.440]   Not necessarily this.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   Right.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.800]   Yeah, and we also, I mean when we first were looking at the land and I think when we first
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.600]   bought it, we talked about so many different options.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.560]   I mean I was checking out books from the library on like straw bale and adobe and just all
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.520]   sorts of alternative building materials.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:55.960]   We've talked for a long time about SIPs or structurally insulated panels.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:03.760]   Growing up my parents built their house and they used adobe and they did it all themselves.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.240]   Growing up it was a great experience and I got to see them do that and be a part of it.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.440]   I've always kind of thought that's what I would do.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.400]   The original plan was to buy some land and I'll build a house myself because I can do
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   that.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:24.880]   The more we got into it and everything and where we live, permits are insanely expensive.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.480]   I can't be a husband and a father and a good employee and do all this while I'm building
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.720]   a house successfully.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.840]   So you know.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.520]   You're in California, right?
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.000]   Southern California.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   So you're right in Code Happy, in the middle of, sounds like Code Happy Municipality, is
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   that right?
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.880]   Yeah, we're in San Diego County.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.800]   What made you choose to move there?
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.600]   I grew up here.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:01.200]   I spent some time here as a kid and then my parents moved to Arizona when I was in middle
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   school or something like that.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.400]   It took me a while to get back but I can't imagine being anyplace else.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:14.040]   I spent some time on the East Coast and up in the Northwest and there's just really no
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   place like it.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.600]   And we have family close too.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:23.560]   One of Noah's sisters lives close and my parents are just like 10 miles away or something.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   Right.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.920]   So you're going with more just traditional kind of mainstream construction methods then
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.760]   on the house project that you're working on?
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.520]   After looking at a lot of the options, I mean it's hard to find a general contractor that'll
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.720]   do alternative building.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.200]   And then I looked at things like shipping container homes and a whole bunch of different
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   stuff.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.240]   But it's harder to get them permitted a lot of times, especially shipping containers specifically.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:55.960]   I was really excited about those and getting them permitted and letting, the county letting
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.560]   you build that way is really difficult.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.000]   And it's like you were saying, Code Happy.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.160]   So greasing all those palms is not financially viable.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:13.160]   So after looking at all the options, and I wanted to try to stay as green as possible.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.600]   So the SIP panels and stuff like that, great insulation, all this kind of stuff.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:23.240]   But the more research I did, the payback on it was like 80 years.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.360]   So it's great that I'm saving electricity but if it takes me 80 years to pay them off,
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.400]   I'm not really helping me out.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.400]   Right.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:36.440]   It's interesting because it brings up a, brings up the conundrum.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.760]   And I face exactly the same thing.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.200]   So I live in West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:48.800]   And I'm very interested in, I don't know what the right term would be, I guess I'm interested
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.000]   in architectural methods.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.920]   And I find it a constant learning curve.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:03.200]   Because it's easy to dismiss everything that we do today as being without form or without
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   reason.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.760]   Why do we build these houses out of this material?
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   Why do we build it in such a way?
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:15.640]   And it's easy to kind of just on the one hand dismiss the work of many knowledgeable people
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.080]   who have developed the systems that we use.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.520]   And I'm guilty of that myself many times, of just kind of saying, "Ah, this is all stupid.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.520]   This stinks.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.560]   We should all go and live in rammed earth houses.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.400]   We should all build earth ships."
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.160]   Something like that.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.440]   But as the more I look at it though, and the more I study, I see that there really are
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:39.280]   some interesting techniques that just don't seem to be applied.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.840]   I look around and I look at the developments in the communities and things around here
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.320]   and I just say, "They all look very pretty.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:53.400]   And they're very strong for hurricanes, but they're woefully inefficient as a energy inefficient.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.020]   And they're just expensive to live in and expensive to maintain."
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.000]   But the problem is I choose to live in West Palm Beach, Florida and the code system is
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.560]   very well intentioned to keep everyone safe and to keep the houses safe, but it destroys
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:13.520]   any possibility of using some of the alternative methods.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:18.040]   So I look longingly at some of the alternative methods and think and constantly design in
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.560]   my head how I could design a house that wouldn't need to run an air conditioner year round
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.000]   in West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.400]   And I've got some pretty good ideas that I think would work, but I can't do them.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.680]   And it's very frustrating, at least to me.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.760]   Yeah, I hear you.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.720]   I'm kind of in the same boat there.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.360]   I think, I kind of go back and forth.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.400]   I know the codes are there to help protect people and stuff like that, but essentially
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.880]   I'm kind of like, "Well, it's my land.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.640]   It's my house.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.120]   I will take those risks."
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.680]   But I guess down the line that would matter more.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:02.000]   But a lot of the alternative methods and stuff like that, a lot of it is code issues or just
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.760]   the price points haven't gotten down to a point where it's reasonable to do those things.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:13.160]   It's unfortunate that it's worse for the environment, but it's more financially viable to run your
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.400]   air conditioning all year long as opposed to doing a poured concrete house or using
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.000]   the SIPs.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.880]   That's unfortunate, but until more bigger builders start using those, that technology
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.120]   isn't going to come down in price.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.560]   Until they're able to mass produce and market it in such a way, you're going to have those
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.840]   high prices.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.480]   I think in our lifetime, I think we'll see it where we really adopt those methods and
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.080]   the price comes down to a point where it's sustainable and it makes sense for builders.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.320]   Unfortunately, we're not there yet.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.200]   Here's what I want, and maybe you've seen it.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.200]   I haven't seen anyone do this yet, but I want completely modular building structures.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.520]   I want to buy when getting started.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.320]   I want somebody, and I don't care if this is built off of shipping containers, built
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:05.400]   it on trailers, built it with ... It should be easy to create this, but basically, build
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:11.440]   for me a ... Let me buy a living room unit, a bedroom unit, a kitchen unit, and a bathroom
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.080]   unit and start my house with that.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:18.760]   Let's say the thing costs me 20 grand, 5,000 bucks a unit, and put it on my land, put a
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.040]   concrete pad in, whatever needs to be done.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:25.840]   Then when I have a baby, I need another bedroom, I call up and I order another bedroom unit
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   and bolt it on.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:32.280]   If I need another bathroom, I order another bathroom and bolt on another bedroom and bolt
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.280]   on what I need.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.480]   Then when I'm done with it, I just turn around and I sell ... Kids grow up, move out of the
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   house.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.200]   They sell one of the bedrooms and the truck comes by, picks it up, takes it on to somebody
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.480]   else who bolts it on to their house.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.960]   That's my idea for how I think housing should work.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.520]   I think it'd be great.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.720]   It'd be like the IKEA kind of housing.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.360]   You just pick this model and bam.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.840]   I just found somebody in France who has built a house.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:08.600]   It wasn't quite this way, but they built the entire thing out of rigid foam, structural
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:14.640]   foam panels, almost maybe about three feet wide, about two feet thick.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.160]   The panels were about 40 feet long.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:22.080]   They put the entire thing together with these panels, 40 feet long, meaning the floor and
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.280]   the ... Not the floor, the roof, the actual ceiling.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.640]   It was load-bearing foam.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.800]   It was fascinating.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.040]   The video online looked awesome as far as the technology.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.400]   I think it's silly that we're building with the same technology that we've been building
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:41.040]   with for basically hundreds of years without any changes and without any updates.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.920]   As we said, codes seem to get in the way.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   I looked at those.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.960]   The structural insulated panels, I think that's similar to what you're talking about.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.560]   It's like a particle board on both sides with a sandwich of high-density structural foam
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.880]   in the middle.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.880]   They're awesome.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:03.920]   I think Europe's a little bit, quite a bit ahead of the curve as opposed to us here on
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.680]   adopting stuff like that and making those changes.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:14.000]   Even just taking the smaller step and even just looking at what we call a modular home
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:23.680]   today or a manufactured home, which we also attempted, being more environmentally friendly
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.920]   because it's all prefab.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.040]   There's not as much waste.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.400]   Everybody that we've talked to and told about our project or what we're doing has said,
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.800]   "Well, have you tried modular?"
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:44.120]   It's unfortunate in some ways also that for one thing, that manufactured housing still
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.720]   has a pretty strong stigma about it as far as resale value and that kind of stuff and
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.200]   having to have it on your title that it's a manufactured house.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:02.080]   It really brings down the value of the home still in a lot of cases.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:10.560]   In our experience, what we've looked at, the quality in some instances is not as high.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.160]   In our attempt, actually, the main reason we wound up not going with modular had to
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:23.480]   do with the company that we were working with primarily more so than those reasons.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:29.160]   It turns out, too, that going with a traditional build, the projected value of the home is
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:34.960]   way higher than it would have been with a modular, which is unfortunate.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:41.080]   This is interesting how the interplay between the financial markets affects the technology
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.420]   that's used.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:47.840]   One of the major problems, at least that I've observed, of all of the alternative designs,
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.600]   whether you're going to build with a geodesic dome or whether you're going to build an earth
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:58.160]   chip or whether you're going to build a straw bale or a modular house, the problem oftentimes
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.080]   with all except the modular house comes with how do we get financing.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.640]   Let's say the house is valued at $50,000, $100,000, $150,000.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.480]   There are many fewer people who are able to simply pay cash for the house no matter how
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.280]   great it is versus being able to finance it.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:21.120]   If you don't fit into the traditional mold, then the finance company often has little
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.000]   ability to know how to work with you.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.560]   You're right, exactly on the modular home, is the technology, at least just from my understanding,
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.280]   is vastly superior.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:37.760]   There's no reason why you can't use a modular approach to create a phenomenal house.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.080]   In many ways, some of the biggest buildings in the world are modular buildings.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.400]   They're all prefab.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.440]   They're all planned to bolt together.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:50.520]   A skyscraper is basically a system of girders that is you have a certain amount of poured
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.000]   concrete and then the girders are all bolted together and it's all planned out, designed
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.040]   and constructed offsite and disassembled onsite.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:02.400]   The financial system and the financing system doesn't support it and then the market has
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.600]   that perception.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:11.240]   We continue to perpetuate the broken cycle simply because that's what is better for our
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   situation.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.240]   Right?
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.240]   Right.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.240]   Just because it doesn't fit.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   Right.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:26.720]   If we would have had more, I think we talked about building it a little bit as we go so
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:32.080]   we wouldn't have to really play that financial game.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:39.480]   But then you're in a situation where the longer it goes on, if you're doing it piece by piece,
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.920]   it goes back to the codes as well.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.160]   You've only got a certain amount of time where you have to show a certain amount of progress
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.160]   and all these kind of things.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.520]   Yeah, maybe it's saving up that much money in a short amount of time wasn't viable for
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.520]   us either.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.520]   Right.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.560]   Well, good for you for working hard with what you got.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.160]   San Diego County is probably not a great place to try to be innovative.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.560]   Neither is Palm Beach County.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.160]   But I pay a lot of attention to what some of the guys out and gals up in Utah or up
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:17.800]   in Tennessee or up in Montana or Wyoming or out in the middle of nowhere or in Texas and
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.520]   non-incorporated areas in Texas where you can just do it.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.320]   That's where a lot of the real innovation is happening and I'm excited to see some of
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.000]   the technologies that are being developed there.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.680]   But good for you for working with what you got.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.320]   I have one other question for you and then we'll wrap up and anything else that you have
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.400]   to say.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:43.720]   I noticed on your site that you guys do home education with your kids?
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:49.360]   Yeah, we're actually part of a local charter school.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.360]   I really like the program a lot.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.160]   It's a hybrid program.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.440]   So my oldest, the only one that's formally in school right now, she's in first grade.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:07.480]   So she goes to what they call workshop two days a week with a teacher in a classroom
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.920]   environment.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.040]   And then the other three days I teach her from home.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:21.080]   They provide a standard curriculum and they guide it day by day.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.080]   This is what you should be doing.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:28.560]   But they also allow you a lot of freedom to do things how you want to do them, how best
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.160]   fits for your student and your lifestyle and stuff.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.840]   Is that sponsored by the public school system?
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.840]   It is.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.840]   It's a public school system.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.120]   It's a public charter.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:49.640]   So it does still have to go through all the state standards and all that kind of stuff.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:59.920]   But just the actual program itself allows for a lot of individuality and freedom.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.920]   How does that benefit you?
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.880]   Why did you decide to participate in that versus just simply designing your own plan
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.040]   for your kids?
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:14.880]   Well, when we first started considering homeschooling, I thought that that kind of what I thought
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.760]   I did think that it was kind of like either or.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.720]   Either you go to public school or you go to private school or you homeschool.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.480]   I wasn't aware of the hybrid program at all.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.280]   And I think for a lot of parents, even just considering the choice to homeschool, it can
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.640]   be really intimidating, you know, taking that huge responsibility onto yourself.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:42.800]   I did a ton of research and I was all prepared to go it on my own when somebody introduced
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   me to this model.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:49.040]   And I guess my first reaction to it was kind of like, "Wow, it sounds like homeschooling
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.040]   but with training wheels."
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.040]   Yeah, right.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.800]   It's just kind of like you get to put your feet in the water.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.840]   What is it like to actually stay home?
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:01.040]   I mean, I was staying home with my kids all day anyway, but to actually have a formal
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:08.120]   schooling environment and what is that actually like?
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:15.280]   And my daughter, my oldest, she's in first grade, she really, really, really wanted to
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.760]   go to school.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:21.600]   And she loves going to class and she loves seeing her friends.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:34.960]   So for her, I think it's mainly a social drive that really keeps her wanting to go those
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.560]   two days a week.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.880]   As we've gone along these past couple of, you know, kindergarten was our first year
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.640]   and this will be our second.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.640]   I have.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.520]   I've kind of craved a little bit more freedom.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.240]   I've written about it a little bit on the blog, just a little bit.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:59.360]   My instincts kind of tend a little bit more toward like the unschooling school of thought
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.200]   where I do, especially at these younger ages, I just kind of want to let them go and play
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.720]   and learn naturally rather than sitting down and here now we have to do this and now we
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.600]   have to fill out this worksheet and that kind of stuff.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:19.880]   So I would like to have a little bit more independence, but she just loves going to
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.880]   class.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.880]   First grade is fun, right?
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:28.160]   So we're just kind of taking it as it goes.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.640]   Right now this really works for us.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:34.720]   And it is nice to be able to spend time with my younger two, those two days when she's
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.720]   in class.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.200]   I can't imagine anybody objecting to first grade.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   First grade is fun.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.760]   Now fourth grade on the other hand, or sixth grade or seventh grade, that's a different
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.560]   question of a first grade.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.720]   The children are sweet and the activities are fun.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.080]   You go coloring with your friends.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.080]   That's a good day.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.080]   Exactly.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:08.800]   It's when you sit at the desk all day and study a textbook that was put together that's
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.520]   boring as anything.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.600]   That's when you start to have more challenges.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.200]   It's interesting that you talk about the new model.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.920]   I have some good friends of mine who have gone back and forth and they're currently
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.720]   using that model out in Texas.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.520]   And they're using, their version is not a charter school.
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.000]   It's a private independent school.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.560]   But they do, I think it's two days in class and then three days at home.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   And I think that can really be an advantage for families busy.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.540]   Especially if you're expecting a new baby.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:46.680]   That can really help with some structure that takes a little bit of the stress and the pressure
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:54.800]   off while still retaining many of the valuable benefits of basically not being in school.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.400]   But hopefully avoid the problems of being in school.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.880]   And I think that's a really great model.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.280]   I would love to see, one of the things I personally predict, I'd love to see hundreds and hundreds
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.960]   of new models created and new people try things and compete.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.280]   And I love that that charter school has that model to compete with the other approaches.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:20.380]   What was your path to, why did you, what even raised the idea for you of considering taking
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.840]   charge of your kids' education?
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   I think for me, well, for me, I was public school raised all through K through 12.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.960]   And I always thought that homeschooled kids were kind of weird.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:40.160]   And so it never really occurred to me to do it until my oldest probably hit around two
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:45.960]   or three when you start thinking maybe a little bit about preschool or school or just what
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.400]   your options are and that kind of stuff.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:52.240]   And it just kind of occurred to me that even within the next couple years or whatever,
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:44:00.600]   I wasn't going to be ready to send her to somebody else eight hours a day, you know,
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.480]   and see her less than somebody else was seeing her, you know, and kind of give away that
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:10.360]   influence and that priority in her life.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.680]   And so that's when I really started researching.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:17.440]   I started going on homeschooling blogs and I started talking to women that I knew that
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.280]   were homeschooling.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:25.800]   And it really changed my perspective on it, you know, because one of the most common questions
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.040]   and the question that I had too was like, "Well, you know, they're never going to be
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.040]   socialized."
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:37.080]   It's just such an obnoxious question to homeschool moms I have since discovered.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:42.320]   And just kind of having people sit down and be like, "No, no, no.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.320]   That's silly."
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   Because actually, you know, in many situations, a homeschooled kid is being socialized much
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:59.360]   more naturally than sitting in a classroom with 30 of his same-aged peers, you know,
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.360]   to only interact with.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.200]   You know, they're going, they go with me to the grocery.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.640]   They go with me everywhere, you know, so they're getting more of an idea of what real life
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   is like.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:14.520]   They would just sitting in the classroom eight hours a day, five days a week.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.960]   Is that what was the, is that the argument that was compelling for you to allay your
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.680]   fears about socialization?
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.560]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:29.600]   And just the fact that, I mean, not with regard to socialization, but just the fact that,
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.640]   you know, up until they start school, you teach them everything they know.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   You know, there's no reason why as soon as they turn five, you know, and that cutoff
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:41.840]   date passes that you stop knowing more than they do.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:47.840]   You know, you don't lose your ability to teach your children right at that instant, you know,
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.840]   because you don't have a certification or accreditation.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.840]   Right, right.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:55.640]   Yeah, for me, I went along with it because I didn't want to let her go.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:59.800]   She's, you know, come back with, and they're like different kids, you know.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:03.920]   I saw it like with my nieces and stuff like that, you know, you kind of see it change,
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   you know.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.600]   So when Sarah started bringing up, you know, thinking about homeschooling, I was like,
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.640]   yes, let's keep her sheltered some more.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.840]   I'm not quite ready to let her go.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:12.840]   Right, right.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:19.680]   And I think also with the homeschooling model that the charter introduces, I've heard it
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:26.520]   referred to as a university model, you know, where it is just a couple days a week or whatever,
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:31.280]   that the family environment in comparison to a public school is a little bit different
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.560]   because there does have to be at least one parent at home with the kids, you know.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.600]   One parent has to be involved with that child, you know, day to day and with their education
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.760]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.000]   And I think that there's a difference, you know.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.840]   There's a difference in the culture of the school and in the classroom and the parents
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:01.480]   that you meet, you know, and then the kids' behavior too, I have to say.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:07.080]   My wife and I, we have one son and he's one year old, so we haven't been, you know, you're
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.480]   a few years ahead of us as far as actual experience.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:19.200]   But in watching it, and we hope to take charge of his education at home as well.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:24.120]   But in watching it, one of the things that I observe is many times people mix up a lot
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.260]   of words and they use them interchangeably.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:32.220]   So for example, oftentimes we use interchangeably the word school and education.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.260]   And those words are very different.
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:39.620]   School versus education is very different if you actually kind of explore some of the
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:41.140]   nuance.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:45.640]   And other things, so for example, I've got issues with, I personally have some issues
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.420]   with how the schooling system works for the negative socialization for the way that you
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:57.740]   say, like exactly the concern that many people have about kids that are educated at home.
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:01.060]   The same concern that they have, I have the opposite concern.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:06.500]   And I've observed that kids are probably going to turn out just about like their parents.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:12.820]   So if the parents are awkward, socially awkward, it's likely that the kids are going to be
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:14.460]   socially awkward.
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:19.560]   And if the parents are socially adept, then it's likely that the kids will be socially
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.940]   adept because they're going to model their parents.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:28.700]   So people oftentimes have met, we've all met, man, there are some awkward kids in school
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.700]   every day, right?
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.700]   There are some very socially awkward kids.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.540]   I mean, there are some socially awkward parents in every part of society.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:42.660]   So I think that's a poor basis of judging the results that somebody gets with an educational
[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:43.660]   system.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:50.840]   I look at it and I say, the idea that the valuable socialization is from a classroom
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:56.900]   filled with eight year olds or filled with 15 year olds, that that's the valuable socialization.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.120]   This is a very strange concept in the history of the world.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.160]   Throughout history, society has always been integrated.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:10.600]   And you've had an integration of children, fully integrated with parents, grandparents,
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.880]   uncles, aunts, the entire community.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:18.560]   I forget the person who popularized the saying, but the saying of it takes a village to raise
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.720]   a child.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.040]   Life has always been integrated.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.320]   This is how we learn.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:29.160]   And yet in our society and in modern society, we've embarked on this very strange idea that
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:35.560]   somehow the best person to teach a 13 year old girl socialization skills is another 13
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.560]   year old girl.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.560]   Right, exactly.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.640]   Really not the best plan in my opinion.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.920]   I think we see the results.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.760]   Look at the frustration in children.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.000]   And I learned this even from my own personal experience.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.200]   I was, with the exception of third grade when I was in public school, I was educated at
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.520]   home through seventh grade and then I went to a traditional private school.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:06.840]   And in seventh grade, I always felt like I got along great with adults.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.460]   I just fit in well in society.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.980]   And then I had to learn all these new skills of somehow fitting into these weird cliques
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:16.480]   and the cool kids and the not cool kids and all this weird stuff I'd never had to deal
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.480]   with.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.200]   And it wasn't until I finally got to college again that I started to feel kind of more
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:26.560]   normal because people backed off of the silly high school stuff.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:31.220]   And then when I became an adult and I recognized, wow, people don't care about what I look like
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.000]   and they don't care about these silly things.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.280]   It's just they're interested in my ideas.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:39.500]   It was such a freeing concept that I hadn't had since I was in sixth grade.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:44.400]   Well, it's interesting too that you bring that up because one of the conversations that
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.320]   I have with one of my brothers, he doesn't have any kids yet, but he's so interested
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.600]   in our journey with the homeschooling and stuff.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:56.960]   His point is that we went through school and I have four brothers and I think all of us
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:02.180]   kind of took our knocks as far as getting picked on.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:08.100]   And it was kind of like, well, even though that was a terrible experience, bullies and
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:12.580]   having to deal with that kind of stuff, it teaches you empathy.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:18.700]   And he was like, "Do you feel like your kids are going to be missing out if they don't
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:25.860]   experience that or just being picked on by other kids of their age?"
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:30.220]   And I don't think that there's any parent out there that's like, "No, I really want
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.980]   my kid to get picked on for a little while."
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:41.020]   But I think that one of the biggest things is that most of our generation was public
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.260]   schooled and that's all we know.
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:52.220]   And if that's not the right way or if there's other ways, it kind of makes it feel like
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:55.380]   our experience wasn't necessary.
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:59.500]   It makes it invalid almost.
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:05.260]   I feel like a lot of people feel in danger of having their experience invalidated.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.700]   I went through public school, so you have to go through public school.
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.500]   You're going to learn the same things that I learned.
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.580]   You're going to go through that school of hard knocks.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.620]   And I think it takes courage to look back at that and be like, "No, maybe that wasn't
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:17.700]   necessary.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:18.700]   Maybe there is a different way.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:22.180]   Maybe there is a better way for my kids."
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:27.760]   I think you just proved your concern even in the statement that you just made.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:35.540]   If school were about education, then we wouldn't have any concerns about the social fear of,
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.540]   "Well, no.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.060]   You've got to go through what I went through."
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:45.100]   If school were about education, we would applaud those who had achieved an excellent education.
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.700]   But our concerns are generally from a social perspective.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:52.700]   If people aren't taught their place, if people aren't taught their class, if people are not
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:53:01.180]   taught these certain things, whether it's -- I won't give any examples, but if people
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:09.900]   are not taught this common core of what they need to know for everyone to be the same,
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.060]   then how can our society function?
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:17.620]   I think you just proved the point, even in what you were saying, logically, that it's
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:23.860]   less about education and it's very much about organizing society, at least in my observation.
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.860]   Yeah, I think that's valid.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.860]   It is interesting, though.
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:37.300]   I have a friend, a close friend, who was homeschooled her whole life, but she grew up very isolated.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.300]   She was raised on a mountaintop, actually.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.300]   Really?
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:49.780]   The neighbors who lived in a bus, but that's beside the point.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:53.700]   She actually went through kindergarten through her sophomore year of high school before she
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.100]   finally was like, "Okay, I'm going to public school now."
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.740]   She really felt like she was missing out.
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.740]   She felt isolated.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:05.420]   She felt like she didn't want to be homeschooled anymore.
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:06.420]   She kind of held her hand.
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.420]   She said, "I'm going to high school now."
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.500]   It's interesting talking to her.
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.740]   Her kids aren't at school age yet.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.900]   As far as I know, she hasn't decided what path she's going to take.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.660]   From talking to her, she said that one of the things that was really neat was that when
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:25.500]   she went to high school, she had so many fears that she was going to be so far behind in
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:26.500]   her education.
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.180]   She felt like she'd missed out on all this stuff.
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:33.780]   Then going to school, she was like, "Oh, no.
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:34.780]   I'm ahead.
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.340]   I know all this stuff already."
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:45.980]   It didn't take very much at all for her to figure out where she was and what she was
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:50.140]   doing and to assimilate into the culture.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:54.060]   I think that that's another fear, too, that people have is that, "I take my kid out of
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.220]   this environment and someday they want to go back.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:55:05.740]   They're going to have this huge gap, all these learning gaps or something like that."
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:09.460]   I just don't think that that's necessarily a realistic fear because there are so many
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:13.100]   things that we think that we have to teach children and that we have to cram into their
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:16.020]   brain at a really early age.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:17.020]   They have to read by this age.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.780]   They have to know their numbers and how to add and all these things.
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:24.180]   As you get older, those things are really, really easy and quickly taught and quickly
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:25.180]   learned.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:31.940]   Any learning gaps that there might be are pretty quickly covered once you realize that
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:32.940]   they're there.
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:33.940]   It's like being an adult.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:38.380]   You realize, "Oh, I never learned about this era of history."
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.900]   Then you pick up some books and you read about it.
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:42.180]   You watch some movies and there you go.
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.540]   Gap filled.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.540]   Right.
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:45.540]   Right.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:54.260]   I'm interested, even on this show, about some of the ways that if we take a little bit more
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:59.820]   interest in thinking farther ahead than general society does.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:07.420]   The problem that general society has, especially the problem that politicians and policymakers
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:12.020]   and bureaucrats face, is that they have to think of the common good.
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.660]   They have to think of all people.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:17.740]   They have to design systems that work for all people.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:21.560]   If they're going to design a schooling system, they need to design it in a way that's going
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.880]   to work for everybody.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.580]   Maybe they'll have a little bit of variability there.
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:29.100]   You may have a gifted program, but there you have two programs.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.900]   You've got to fit everybody into one of these two tracks.
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:40.980]   As individuals taking charge of our own lives and hopefully our own children's educations,
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.860]   we don't have that same constraint.
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:48.940]   We can customize things exactly based upon our goals and based upon our kids' goals.
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:54.380]   When you look at the incredible start that you can give to a child, whether it's from
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:59.820]   an educational perspective, connecting them not with the teacher who happens to be the
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:04.340]   teacher in the local school, but rather with a world-class teacher who's the best in the
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:09.940]   world in the subject that they're interested in, or whether it's not designing the curriculum
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.660]   that has to work for everyone, but rather let's do this world-class curriculum.
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.660]   We don't read textbooks.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:19.340]   We read primary documents or something along those lines.
[00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:21.180]   Or whether it's just the financial perspectives.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:28.060]   I know many have read and met many home-educated kids who finished their bachelor's degree
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:31.220]   from an accredited university by the time of 18.
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:36.900]   You can basically dispense with the idea of having to deal with that stuff after the primary
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:42.060]   years and you can really help a student go out ahead if they're academically gifted.
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:47.420]   Or you can do, I'm getting ready to bring a guy on the show who all of his sons so far,
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:52.140]   his three older sons and his two others are on track for this, have been able to purchase
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:56.740]   a home debt-free by the time they were in their 20s and got married.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:02.060]   Well, that happened because they were educated at home and were able to really focus on vocational
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:04.300]   skills that then they could use to enhance their life.
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:10.580]   So I think even from a personal finance perspective, it's an incredibly exciting opportunity when
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:16.100]   you think of how we can really set our children on a stronger course than perhaps we had the
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:17.940]   opportunity to go on.
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:19.980]   Absolutely, yeah.
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:24.580]   So anything else, any other ideas that you have or anything else that you'd like to share
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.580]   before we wrap up?
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.580]   I don't think so.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:27.580]   I think we've pretty much covered the bases.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:35.620]   Well, I would just encourage you guys to keep doing what you're doing and keep writing honestly
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.740]   about what your experiences are.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:44.460]   And remember the famous wise words of philosophy, "This too shall pass."
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:52.140]   So hopefully soon you'll meet your new little one and all will be forgotten as you watch
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:53.140]   the house go up.
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:59:01.860]   And in the meantime, I wish you great wisdom as you face all of the challenges with getting
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:02.860]   the project done.
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:07.140]   I know it's going to be a draining, it's going to be a very challenging and draining process,
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:12.140]   but the end result, I'm sure you will enjoy living in your house much more after having
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.340]   spent the time in the bus.
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.340]   So your website is...
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:18.100]   I should mention we're cultivating a lot of gratitude.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.220]   Exactly.
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.580]   Your website is littlebusontheprairie.com.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:25.900]   Is there anything else you'd like to mention before we wrap up?
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:28.180]   As we go here, where people can find you or anything like that?
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:30.740]   No, we're not very social media savvy.
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.980]   That's all we got.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:33.980]   You've got three kids.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.660]   There's your social media.
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:39.140]   Turn off the phones and spend time with your kids.
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.820]   Thank you guys for taking the time to come on the show.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:43.260]   I really have enjoyed chatting with you.
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.260]   Thank you, Josh.
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:45.260]   It was a pleasure.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:50.380]   Told you it'd be fun.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:51.900]   So happy Friday to you.
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:57.980]   Let that send you off with an idea and maybe this weekend you could be thankful for the
[00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.380]   house that you're living in with the air conditioner that you're living in.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:06.660]   I think that it may have helped to bring out some information as far as some of the good
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:11.460]   things and the bad things and just the challenges of life sometimes of working through with
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:16.100]   contractors and working through trying to figure out how do we afford the lifestyle
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.100]   that we have.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:22.060]   In many ways, it's just kind of a dose of reality.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.820]   So thank you for listening.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.980]   Have a great weekend, everybody.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.060]   Next week, I've got a number of shows lined up for you.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:33.700]   I've got three interviews at least in the hopper already which are excellent interviews.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.340]   I think you're really going to enjoy those details next week.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.380]   I'm not sure what order I'm going to play them in.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:42.140]   And then I may actually run a couple more interviews next week because I've got some
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:48.100]   projects I need to finish up and I may not have the time to finish the teaching shows
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:52.820]   that I need to do prior to next week.
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:53.820]   Thanks so much for being here.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:54.820]   Have a great weekend, everybody.
