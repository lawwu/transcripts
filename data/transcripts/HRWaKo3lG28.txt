[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.560]   Dr. J.I. Packer recently passed into glory.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.900]   It was about a year ago that we began to get updates
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.640]   indicating that his race on earth was nearing its end.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.480]   And I had a short list of topics I wanted to talk with him
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.560]   about over the telephone,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.000]   and he very kindly agreed to a series of three phone calls
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.520]   to answer various questions that I had about the Puritans
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.080]   and specifically his thoughts on a Puritan theologian
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.640]   named Thomas Goodwin.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.120]   These were not formal interviews,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.640]   just informal chats that we had.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.280]   However, I knew at the end of that third call,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.920]   it would be the final time that I would speak with him.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.200]   And I wanted to voice my gratitude to God
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.240]   for his life and ministry and to voice it to him.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.300]   And the final minute of that last call I did record,
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.300]   here's how it ended.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.680]   - The world of Puritan studies is waiting
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.680]   for someone to focus on Owen, sorry, on Goodwin
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.560]   as a life's work.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.680]   - Yes, amen. - All right.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.520]   That's Packer sticking his neck out.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.160]   And now I must say over to you.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.400]   - Yeah, excellent.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.400]   Dr. Packer, thank you for your time.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.040]   I am grateful to God for your works
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.320]   and all of the books that you've written over the years.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.480]   And God has used you in a mighty way in my life,
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.160]   and I'm grateful to God for you.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.080]   Thank you.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.120]   And when next you see John Piper,
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.160]   give him my greetings and assurance
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.080]   that though my productive days, I think,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.120]   are over, my position on everything
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.120]   which we've shared views in the past,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.720]   my position remains where it was.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.960]   For general assurance, God be with you and bless you.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.800]   - All right, Dr. Packer, God bless you.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.960]   Thank you. - Bye now.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.840]   (static crackling)
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.040]   - Although Dr. Packer's formal ministry had ended
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.760]   and he would no longer preach or sit at his typewriter
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.040]   to write books or articles, he wanted Pastor John
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.800]   to know that the shared convictions that he had with us,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.160]   the convictions that drove his public ministry,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.280]   convictions about Christ and imputation
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.280]   of personal holiness and of the nature of scripture,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.520]   those convictions were all convictions
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.200]   that he was still clinging to privately.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.360]   I love that, that's precious.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.040]   And I know friends close to him in his final weeks and days
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.320]   and hours on earth confirmed the very same thing.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.880]   Until the very end, Dr. Packer talked
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.040]   about the preciousness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.880]   And those shared convictions that we had with him
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.400]   bring us back to an earlier date, five years ago.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.840]   It was in April of 2015, Pastor John traveled
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.960]   from Minneapolis to Vancouver to interview Dr. Packer
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.240]   about life, doctrine, and ministry.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.600]   What resulted from their time together
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.920]   is a 72 minute conversation.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.400]   This interview has never been released until now.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.480]   Here it is.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.480]   - Dr. Packer, in 1988, you came
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.800]   to the Bethlehem Conference for Pastors.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.400]   You may not even remember that we started as a church.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.080]   It's been going on now for, what's that, 27 years or so.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   And you didn't know anything about this.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.120]   It was the very first one.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.840]   I didn't know if anybody would come.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.200]   And I wanted to publicly thank you for coming.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   And I mention it because you have, I think,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.840]   assumed that lowly, risk-taking servant role
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.800]   for more than one ministry.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.520]   Getting our little conference off the ground
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.560]   with your presence was a gift to us.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.160]   So thank you, and the legacy has been significant.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.960]   There's another thing.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.920]   If you wanna respond, you can in just a minute.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.760]   There's another thing.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.880]   Two years before that, and I'm almost sure
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.800]   you won't remember this, I wrote a book
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.640]   called Desiring God, first popular book.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.080]   My dissertation doesn't count
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.720]   because it didn't get any blurbs.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.520]   And you wrote a blurb for it, first blurb,
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.440]   right at the top, and you said,
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.960]   "The ghost of Jonathan Edwards
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.840]   "walks through the pages of this book."
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.280]   (laughs)
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.400]   And you added, to my amazement,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   "I think he would be pleased with his disciple."
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.120]   It really did bring tears to my eyes.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.880]   That you would write it, that you would say that,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.880]   moved me deeply.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.400]   So for those two reasons, a blurb on my first popular book,
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.360]   and the first speaker at the Bethlehem Conference
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.240]   for Pastors has endeared you to me
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.760]   in some pretty significant ways.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.480]   - Well, that's a very gracious way
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.960]   for you to start this conversation.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.960]   I appreciate it, and you remind me of things
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.920]   which are very happy memories, as a matter of fact.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   Nothing that has happened since I made those gestures
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.400]   has changed my mind about any of the things
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.840]   that we had in common then.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.960]   And, well, it's just a great joy to be talking to you now,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.320]   after so many years,
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.080]   and realizing that all of this stays firm.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.920]   - Yeah.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.680]   So here's the way I wanna turn that ghost comment
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.360]   into a question.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.240]   So Jonathan Edwards is walking through John Piper's writings
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.000]   like a ghost, and I'm happy with that.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.280]   And to be called a disciple
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.160]   who would be pleasing to the master,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.000]   that sub-master is pleasing to me.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   You have different ghosts walking through your pages.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.160]   And if I were to guess what they are,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160]   I think it's pretty clear.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   They are English Puritans from the 17th century.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.560]   - You're right.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.600]   - You have called them Redwoods in the book,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.280]   "The Quest for Godliness."
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.460]   So the question is kind of twofold.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.200]   What, speaking now to younger people
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.280]   who may be very marginally familiar
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.140]   with that group of Redwoods,
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.560]   what was it about them that took you,
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.340]   took hold of you, and have stayed hold of you,
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.920]   that would be useful for us today?
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.440]   And subordinately, does Edwards walk at all
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.880]   through the pages?
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.500]   In other words, did Edwards have a little place
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.100]   in the shaping of J.I. Packer?
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.160]   Just take those one at a time.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.760]   If you forget the Edwards piece, I'll bring you back.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.160]   Talk about the Puritans for a minute.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.560]   - Well, the first thing to say, I think,
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.680]   is that the Puritans broke into my life
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.700]   when I was still a young Christian.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.720]   I became a believer at Oxford,
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.520]   and I was put in charge of a library
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.560]   that had been left to the university chapter,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.240]   and in that library were uncut volumes
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.640]   of the works of John Owen, who by general consent,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.920]   of course, is the top Puritan.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   And I was interested, simply, I suppose,
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.360]   because I'm that sort of person.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.720]   I like to know about the past of anything
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.480]   that I'm interested in in the present.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.280]   And at that time, in the present,
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.920]   I was interested in, well, more than interested,
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.760]   I mean, I was committed as a disciple of Christ.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.560]   I was a new disciple.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.640]   I was trying to catch up for all those years
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.000]   during which I hadn't been a believer,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.440]   and from that standpoint, it was time wasted.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.720]   And I had heard that the Puritans
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.380]   were something rather special.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.680]   So I cut the pages, the uncut pages,
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.120]   of a volume of John Owen and started reading.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.920]   Now, I hadn't expected what happened.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.660]   I was reading him on indwelling sin in believers
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.800]   and the mortification of sin in believers.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   I hadn't realized that I had a major problem at that point
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.600]   until Owen showed me that I did,
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.520]   showed me what it was, showed me how to understand myself,
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   and showed me what the Lord would do for me
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.880]   and what I must do for him to deal
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.640]   with the sin that was still operating in my life.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.640]   So unexpectedly, John Owen, for a time, became my pastor.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:17.880]   And I moved out from John Owen to various of his friends.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.680]   Richard Baxter was another great Puritan
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.400]   whom I began to read and was thrilled by.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.600]   And I read for the first time seriously
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.040]   Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, both parts.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.960]   And, well, there were quite a number, actually,
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.600]   of other Puritans of almost equal stature
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.440]   whom I read because Owen,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.880]   although actually he's difficult in style,
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.280]   Owen gave me a taste for a reality
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.400]   which now I think I'd describe
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   in terms of the recognition of God, quite simply.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.960]   The Puritans carried a tremendous sense of God with them,
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.600]   and Owen, with his awkward style,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.720]   was able to communicate that sense of God.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.480]   And it took me a little time to recognize
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.240]   what it was that was coming across.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.640]   But in fact, during those months
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.560]   when I was doing my first exploration of the Puritans,
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.520]   I was also able from time to time
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.200]   to listen to the great Martin Lloyd-Jones
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.600]   preaching the gospel.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.400]   And Martin Lloyd-Jones, more than any preacher
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.000]   whom I have ever sat under, brought God with him.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.320]   That's the only way to say it.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.160]   Brought God with him into the pulpit.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.160]   And from being in worship that he was leading,
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.360]   I got to the point where I recognized
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   the reality of God is what's impacting me from the Puritans.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.760]   >> Is that--
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.640]   >> And that stays with me today.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.680]   >> Is that what you mean by Redwoods?
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.240]   >> That's one of the things that I mean by Redwoods.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.240]   It isn't all.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   The Redwood image is intended to conjure up
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:35.920]   the thought of stability and strength
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.520]   and the capacity to stand firm under pressure.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.680]   Actually, I'm not sure that in terms of botany
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.800]   that actually works for Redwoods.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.960]   I've been told that they have shallow root systems.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.240]   And that isn't part of the picture at all.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.600]   The Puritans were very strong
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.680]   because they had very strong root systems.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:06.920]   But yes, they became my example, as they still are,
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:13.480]   of folk who lived slowly enough
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.600]   to be able to think deeply about God.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.240]   And they did.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.240]   And what they thought, they expressed.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.360]   Some of them were quite eloquent, actually,
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.080]   in the ordinary sense of the word.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:38.920]   Bunyan, for instance, is a very pleasant writer to read.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.760]   >> Who did you say?
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.600]   >> Bunyan.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.680]   >> Okay.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.440]   >> Quite a poet from the fact that, in my estimate,
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.640]   at any rate, Pilgrim's Progress
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.240]   is simply magnificent as Christianity.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:56.040]   >> Well, anyway, have I given you the idea
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.640]   of what I mean by Redwoods?
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.480]   I hope so.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.320]   And you asked about Jonathan Edwards.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   >> Right, in other words, he does not figure in your thinking
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.720]   the way he figures in my thinking.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.280]   He's prominent.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.160]   They are prominent for you.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.280]   >> He did for you what John Owen did for me.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.920]   >> Yes, that would be very true.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.520]   He was for you the first exponent
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.960]   of the strong sense of God,
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.480]   the strong thinking about God's reality,
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.560]   and the strong perception
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.920]   of what a healthy relationship with God is like.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.760]   >> Right.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.360]   >> I'm not telling you anything you don't know.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.080]   You wrote about that again and again,
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.760]   very clearly and strongly,
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.600]   and I thought rightly from every standpoint.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   And I was writing, and still I suppose from some,
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.800]   every now and then, I am writing still,
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   things about the Puritans which are intended
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.660]   to highlight those particular Puritan virtues,
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.280]   which I learned from Owen, Baxter, Bunyan,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.120]   and the rest of them.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.480]   >> Would it be accurate to say
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.480]   that the pattern of pastoral theological life
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.920]   that you have developed for decades
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.360]   is profoundly, it seems to me,
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.240]   affected by the way Puritans live their lives?
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.560]   In other words, they were pastors,
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.680]   mostly not university professors.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.080]   You have been a professor,
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:42.080]   but your writing ministry and your church ministry
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:47.200]   has seemed to be marked by a more pastoral bent than many.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.640]   >> Well, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.380]   the two things come together and bond.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.880]   I mean, as a matter of history,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.800]   those Puritans who worked in universities,
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.080]   and quite a number of them did for more or less time,
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.080]   they saw themselves in that situation as pastors.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.260]   They preached, they catechized,
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.560]   they pastored the young men
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.640]   who were passing through their hands.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.840]   It was understood in those days
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.500]   that a university tutor would do that.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:32.440]   The gulf between academic theology
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.540]   and personal devotion didn't exist in those days.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:43.020]   And it seems to me that that was a much healthier
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.900]   state of affairs than you can match
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.480]   in most universities nowadays.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.480]   But certainly, that's how they saw their vocation.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:16:00.120]   And I equally certainly, yes, well, it's true,
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.920]   I equally certainly, equally strongly
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   have believed myself called to pastor,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.960]   to shepherd, to guide folk as best I can
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.280]   in their relationship with God, in their service of God.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.840]   And, well, that I suppose has a lot to do
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.220]   with what we were talking about,
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.560]   the fact that the Puritans pastored me at an early stage.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.560]   But it's beyond, behind that and beneath that,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.220]   it's rooted in the Bible.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.700]   I mean, if you think of the apostles,
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.540]   think particularly of Paul, followed by John,
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.660]   and the para-apostles,
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.960]   people like the writer to the Hebrews,
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:58.400]   they were persons with tremendously strong minds.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.180]   That, by the way, really does include the apostle John.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:07.260]   He had a marvelously simple way of expressing
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.260]   the marvelously profound things that he has to communicate.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:20.020]   Paul is more obviously, how can I say it,
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:25.580]   a very strong-minded man and a very articulate man.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.680]   And, well, Hebrews the same.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.680]   As far as I'm concerned, these things belong together.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.200]   >> Yeah, the Bible running like a massive stream
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:48.520]   underneath your work and the Puritans.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.360]   In 1978, you were happy to be a part
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.900]   of the battle for the Bible.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.880]   You helped move beyond the battle for the Bible
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.080]   of the book by that title.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.040]   It was about inerrancy.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.960]   Here we are 30 some years later,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   and are you as equally committed
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.920]   to the doctrine of inerrancy today?
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   And why should young people embrace,
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.420]   defend, minister out of a conviction like that?
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.240]   >> Well, first of all, as a matter of personal effect,
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.640]   yes, my commitment to the inerrancy of Scripture
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.880]   is as strong as ever it was.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.960]   And the basis of it is a recognition
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   that Scripture according to the Lord Jesus,
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.320]   there's no higher authority than he,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.740]   Scripture according to the Lord Jesus
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.860]   is precisely the word of God,
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.660]   the word of his heavenly father,
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:00.660]   the word of authority to which he models obedience
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.940]   to show his disciples amongst other things,
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.400]   the way that they must go.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:12.740]   And it seems to me as the years go by
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:18.620]   that the gulf between those who do
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.660]   and those who don't recognize the,
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.700]   what I would call if I'm left to choose my own phrase,
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.800]   the divinity of the Scriptures,
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.220]   the gulf is deeper than it was.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.540]   I hoped that the result or one result
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.100]   of the public controversy about inerrancy
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.420]   during the late '70s and on
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.880]   would be that the hollowness,
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.160]   and I think that's the word that fits,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.960]   the hollowness of liberal claims
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.920]   to insight and authority and spiritual things
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.680]   would appear and the next generation of liberals
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.400]   would quietly dissociate themselves from it
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.840]   so that they wouldn't need to be labeled liberals anymore.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.740]   It hasn't been like that.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.740]   And if I'm asked to diagnose what's happened,
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:24.120]   I would say, well, one thing that has happened
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.920]   is that the intellectual pride
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.700]   that produced liberalism in the first instance,
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.880]   challenging the Bible, you see,
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.600]   and professing, at least in their own hearts,
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.960]   these people did professing to be wiser than the Bible,
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:50.520]   that pride has strengthened its grip, I think,
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:57.720]   so that the non-inerrantists in the church
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:06.160]   are further from the truth and the wisdom
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.640]   that comes of acknowledging the divinity
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.240]   of the word of God than their predecessors were.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:20.640]   Well, all right, sin in the world often wins victories,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.200]   which one would have hoped they wouldn't win
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.400]   and one wouldn't have expected them to win,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.960]   but I was telling another group of people only yesterday
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.240]   with as much emphasis as I could manage,
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:38.240]   Satan, who stands behind all the unbelief in the world,
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.800]   he is a very cunning operator,
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:47.960]   and, well, he doesn't give up.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:53.480]   He devises new ways of establishing his grip
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:58.400]   in the lives of people whose positions are shown
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   to be flimsy, intellectually flimsy, as they stand.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.940]   Satan doesn't say, well, all right,
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.040]   then you'd better become orthodox again.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.040]   Satan says, I've got a better idea for you
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.480]   along the line that you've been following,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.720]   and the better, supposedly better idea emerges,
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.040]   and away they go.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   >> Within those who embrace the divinity,
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.800]   inerrancy of scripture,
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.640]   there emerge differences of the way they read it.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:47.200]   Another theme through your writings is a love for,
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:52.180]   a defense of, an exposition of the doctrines of grace,
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.920]   as the Puritans probably would have called them
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.080]   as opposed to, say, the five points of Calvinism,
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.080]   but the question is very simply,
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.800]   if you take the gospel,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.180]   and I'm thinking of 1 Corinthians 15,
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.280]   and you take the five points,
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.500]   soteriological, Calvinism, doctrines of grace,
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.560]   what's the relationship between those two?
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.080]   How do you like to describe the specificities
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.080]   of reformed theology over here
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.120]   in the center of the gospel?
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.040]   If that's even the correct way to set it up.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.280]   >> Well, let others be the judge of that,
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.120]   but as far as I'm concerned,
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:43.720]   the five points of Calvinism are a secondary concern,
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.400]   not a primary one.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.120]   They are the reformed answer to the five points
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.120]   of classical early 17th century Arminianism,
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:24:00.040]   and if there had never been an Arminian version
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.560]   of reformation theology,
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.960]   there never would have been five points at all,
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.720]   but there would have been the doctrines of grace,
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.280]   and that's the conception that I like to pursue
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.280]   and the category in terms of which I like to speak.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.160]   >> So did you mean the doctrines of grace are secondary
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.880]   or the structure of the five points are secondary?
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.180]   >> Well, no, no, the five points are secondary.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.040]   No, no, you have to talk, I think,
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.000]   about the doctrines of grace
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.560]   if you're going to talk about
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.600]   the teaching of scripture at all,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.120]   or the teaching of Paul,
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.280]   or the teaching of the Lord Jesus.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.040]   >> So they are definitions of the gospel,
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.840]   expansions of the gospel, elaborations,
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.160]   insights, elucidations.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.280]   I'm thinking of Spurgeon who said
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.420]   his robust reformed theology,
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.880]   or maybe even Warfield, I think,
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.360]   said this is the gospel in its purest form.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.680]   >> Well, that sounds like Warfield,
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   but it's a sentiment that Spurgeon would have,
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.760]   well, did agree with 100%.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.600]   >> Does Packer?
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.760]   >> Oh, yes, yes.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.080]   Packer belongs to that tribe by the grace of God.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.360]   I have nothing that I've not received,
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.640]   and I'm just profoundly thankful
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.800]   that God in his providence has led me this way
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.500]   'cause this is the truth.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:42.880]   And, well, ultimately, the quest for truth
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.160]   and its reality is what it's all about.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.720]   >> So would another way to say it would be,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.680]   and I don't want to go too far
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.720]   because we have brothers who don't agree with us
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.960]   about some of these things.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.360]   Would it be fair to say that the proper elaboration
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.360]   of the doctrines of grace is good for the gospel?
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.520]   It is a deepening of the gospel,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.200]   a preservation of the gospel, an advancement,
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.760]   not a distraction from the gospel?
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.320]   >> No, I would use the word elucidation, I think.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:21.880]   And I would point to places, passages,
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:27.960]   in the New Testament where these doctrines
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.760]   are laid out and used in the course of pastoral exhortations
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.280]   and simply say, as indeed I think I've already said
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.480]   in one way, and now I will say in another,
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   this is the scriptural path, which is all that concerns me.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:50.480]   I want to go where the scriptures take me.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.560]   Why?
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:56.120]   Because the teaching of scripture is the word of God,
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.400]   the truth of God, the gospel of God,
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.120]   and that's where I cast anchor.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.000]   God has taught me that, and I stay with it.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.400]   >> Amen.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.960]   Another place where the scripture has seemed
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.120]   to take the church for the last, well,
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.520]   2,000 years, I hope, but 500 years,
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.320]   concerning justification, about 15 years ago,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.920]   a prominent New Testament scholar in America
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.760]   wrote a couple of articles in which he said,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   "The doctrine of the imputation of the righteousness
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.680]   "of Christ is not a New Testament doctrine.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.760]   "Justification should be understood without,"
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.280]   more in terms of the forgiveness of sins,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.880]   "not the positive imputation of the righteousness of Christ."
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.320]   In your own experience of the word
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.940]   and in your relationship with Christ,
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.440]   what's the place of that particular aspect
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.840]   of the doctrine of justification,
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.600]   namely the imputation of the righteousness of Christ?
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.480]   >> That's a very fair question,
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.600]   and I know that you're a committed man on that subject.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.400]   You wrote against an English scholar
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.200]   whom I know quite well, as a matter of fact,
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.640]   to try and put the record straight,
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.200]   when in your estimate he had muddled it up a little.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.960]   Seriously, now,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:28.280]   I think the reality
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:34.320]   that we are called to elucidate,
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   and indeed that the scriptures go ahead of us elucidating,
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.680]   the reality of salvation,
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.920]   if the question is asked,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.760]   what sort of a reality is salvation?
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.900]   This is the answer.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.280]   It is union with the risen Christ
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.400]   in the life that is his,
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:01.440]   and that he, through the Holy Spirit, communicates to us
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   so that we are one with him in terms of union of life,
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.680]   even though, of course, we remain distinct from him
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.480]   in terms of personal identity.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:23.820]   But union with Christ is the central category
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.260]   for apostolic thinking, it seems to me,
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.160]   about the substance, the reality of the salvation
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.360]   that is ours when we put faith in Christ.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.720]   This is Paul and this is John,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.800]   and this is where, I think, Peter points
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.000]   in both his letters,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.240]   although he's not so explicit as Paul and John.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.160]   Never mind, he's pointing in the same direction
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.560]   and he's on the same wavelength.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   Well, now, within that relationship,
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:10.880]   the language of the imputing of righteousness,
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:15.640]   which is Paul's phrase in Romans 4,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:21.520]   that language is very properly extended.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.920]   Now, I think one has to say this is going a little beyond
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.240]   what any particular New Testament phrase does,
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:36.600]   but it's entirely on wavelength
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.000]   with the New Testament phraseology.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.480]   It's a slight extension of what Paul says
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.000]   about God imputing righteousness,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.360]   to say, "And the righteousness imputed
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.480]   "is the righteousness of Christ."
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.000]   What does that mean?
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   It means that God judges us as he sees us in Christ.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:06.180]   It means that Christ, in a real substantial sense,
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:11.520]   by virtue of our union with him,
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:18.880]   casts his, I have to be pictorial here,
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.880]   I don't know any other way of saying it,
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.280]   casts his righteousness, his status, that is,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.520]   as the one who has perfectly done the will of God,
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.480]   pleased God, and so is accepted by God,
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.280]   he casts that status over us like,
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:46.200]   what shall I say, a cloak, McIntosh, if you like,
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.400]   covering us and shielding us
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.920]   from what would otherwise be ours,
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:57.120]   namely the clash between our sinfulness,
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.000]   which, well, it is sinfulness,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.760]   as well as a track record of sins.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.600]   The sins are the fruits of the sinfulness.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.080]   Satan is seen to it, that sinfulness
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   runs right through our system as children of Adam and Eve.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:21.320]   But no, we are accounted righteous in Christ
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   because of what Christ is, has been,
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.600]   continues to be, the righteous one.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:40.440]   And the Father sees us in that way.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.800]   And this is our fundamental identity
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   as new creatures in Christ.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:56.720]   So I would say, indeed I often have said,
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.240]   and Douglas will say again,
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:04.720]   that though the imputing of Christ's righteousness
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   isn't a scriptural phrase, it's a scriptural thought
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.000]   and a very fundamental scriptural thought.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.240]   And I wouldn't, therefore, want to discourage
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.720]   reformed people from using it simply on the grounds
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.800]   that it isn't exactly a New Testament thought,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.120]   which I don't think it is, as I said.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.260]   The substance of it, the substance of the meaning
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.720]   is 100% New Testament.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.720]   And when we talk about our life in Christ,
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:50.920]   well, the first thing we have to talk about
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   is the standing, the status, the position
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:01.560]   in relation to Christ and the Father.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.060]   We're united with Christ, and so we are welcomed
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.060]   by the Father in Christ.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.680]   We have to understand that that phrase,
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:14.080]   that little phrase which we so often pass over
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.240]   and so rarely explain in the pulpit or in books
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.440]   or anything, the phrase in Christ,
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.840]   that's a phrase of tremendously weighty meaning,
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.440]   saying everything about justification
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.680]   and everything, actually, about sanctification.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.400]   >> Exactly, which is the next,
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.120]   so I want to just keep you going by sharpening it.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.140]   You have written about holiness a lot.
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.620]   >> Yes, it's true. >> You care
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.980]   about personal holiness and corporate holiness,
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.580]   and your book, "Keep in Step with the Spirit,"
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.500]   was a profoundly helpful book to me.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.900]   So here's my simple question to keep us going
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.900]   from justification, rootedness in Christ,
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.600]   identity in Christ, to walking by the Spirit.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.980]   That's a biblical phrase, walk by the Spirit.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.940]   Now, that's a very paradoxical phrase,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.600]   or Owen, on put to death the deeds of the body
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.080]   by the Spirit. >> Yes.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.360]   >> So how does a human being
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.000]   act with his will
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.360]   in such a way that it can be said,
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.400]   the Holy Spirit has acted?
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.840]   'Cause I assume that's what walk by the Spirit
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.520]   or put to death the deeds of the body by the Spirit means.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.120]   There's something I do, and yet it is not I,
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.080]   but Christ, or something.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.540]   So can you just describe the dynamics,
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.820]   and I mean as practically and as personally as you can,
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.740]   'cause I personally find it strange language
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.620]   that I have to adapt to, it's biblical language,
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.620]   for me to act by the Spirit or walk by the Spirit.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.380]   What does that look like?
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.500]   How do you do that?
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:59.500]   >> Well, the starting point as far as I'm concerned
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   is where we were in the last paragraph of Packer
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.520]   that you pulled out of me.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.460]   The starting point is the relation
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:16.460]   that the apostles express in the phrase, in Christ.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:23.900]   It's a relation of union without identity
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:29.180]   in the sense of one person being absorbed into the other.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:35.120]   It's a relation actually in which the human partner
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:42.880]   becomes more fully a person than ever he or she was before,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.680]   because that's one of the things
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.540]   that resurrection life in Christ
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.140]   and the gift of the Holy Spirit working within us
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:52.980]   brings about.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:00.140]   And there isn't to my mind any obvious analogy
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.760]   that one can use to express it.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.560]   One simply has to talk all the time
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.040]   about two things between which one moves,
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:16.480]   on which one brings the changes,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.660]   but of which both are vital and central.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.580]   One is the discipleship relation,
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:31.360]   which we learn about from the gospels
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.260]   where we are shown how Jesus started
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.260]   the discipleship relation going with his 12.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.880]   And the other aspect of the matter
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.880]   is that the vital energy which operates
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:55.380]   within the person who is following Christ
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:01.200]   through specifics, through the Holy Spirit,
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:08.740]   this energy is, it's the energy of Christ's risen life
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.740]   in us and through us.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:17.920]   And that energy is mediated by the Holy Spirit
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.260]   who indwells us.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:24.240]   When I'm teaching the Trinity,
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:29.660]   again and again I find myself talking about the Holy Spirit
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:34.180]   as the executive agent that brings about
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:39.940]   first of all the relationship in Christ,
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:44.380]   with Christ, with the Father, through the Son.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.200]   You need all those pronouns in order to get it right.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:55.440]   And I talk of him as the executive agent of the Godhead.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:04.480]   I stress that everything in creation, in providence,
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.040]   in grace comes to us from the Father through the Son.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:14.400]   And then I add by the agency recognized
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.520]   or unrecognized, specified or unspecified,
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:23.000]   but nonetheless really energy that's really there,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   the energy of the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.400]   >> So my question-- >> The Trinity,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.400]   the three persons of the Trinity,
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.200]   they're always together.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.360]   None of them ever act separately.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.240]   >> Right, so are there things I do
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   that engage that executive influence?
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.840]   You know, this walk by the Spirit,
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.560]   that's an imperative to me.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.480]   You walk by that agency.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.440]   Very practically, if I get up in the morning,
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:58.000]   what do I do to do that?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.800]   'Cause I'm supposed to obey that command.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.000]   Walk by that agency, by that executive power.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.080]   I don't have, he's sovereign, I'm not God,
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.480]   I don't make him do things, and yet.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.200]   >> Well look, I was trying to say,
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.640]   and I think I have to try again,
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:21.120]   simply because this is a way of thinking
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.400]   that runs all through the New Testament
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.320]   and which we miss.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:32.400]   I mean, some things are so big and so clear
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.020]   that we overlook them.
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.600]   I regularly illustrate this from the letters
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   Pacific Ocean on a map of all that water
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   between Asia and America.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:54.440]   We look at the map and we see the names
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.160]   of dozens of islands.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.280]   It's a big map and all the islands are there.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.920]   And while we're focusing on those details,
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.760]   we miss the big words Pacific Ocean.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:10.120]   And when it's a matter of walking in the spirit,
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.720]   by doing things by the spirit,
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.680]   putting the deeds of the body,
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:20.560]   that is the habits, the bad habits,
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.080]   of our sinful system, that's how I like to explain it,
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.160]   or verbalize it, putting the bad habits
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.520]   of our sinful system to death,
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.660]   that is draining the life out of them
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.000]   so that they don't operate anymore.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.040]   When that's what we're talking about,
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:43.040]   well, what's involved is knowledge
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:51.920]   of what we ought to do, dependence.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:57.940]   I don't think, frankly, that by and large
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.520]   in our evangelical teaching these days,
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:05.060]   we make enough of the truth that we really
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.540]   are dependent on God, God the Holy Spirit,
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:13.540]   quite specifically, to enable us to do anything right,
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.960]   which we do right.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:25.140]   The, how can I say it?
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:31.240]   The way to proceed, it seems, seems to me,
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.240]   is to look to the Lord and tell him,
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:39.740]   in effect, all of this depends on you.
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:44.440]   I can't do it, I can't break a sinful habit,
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:51.200]   I can't form a new pattern of obedience without your help.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.360]   And having thus prayed and made it clear
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.300]   that it all depends on God, then it's up to us
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.300]   to make plans and procedure, devise procedures,
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:14.680]   decide what we're going to do as if it all depends on us.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:20.620]   We are used, I think, in some other places
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.600]   in our discipleship and our theology,
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.620]   to the thought that we pray,
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.740]   acknowledging that it all depends on God,
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.820]   and then proceed as if it all depends on us.
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.500]   >> That's what I remember from the book,
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:40.100]   is that there's a dependence, you say,
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.580]   without you I can do nothing, and then you turn
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.620]   and you get out of bed, you open your Bible,
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.560]   you turn off the television, you don't click
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.980]   on the computer, you do things, but you've said,
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:57.980]   fundamentally, I cannot do this.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.060]   >> And when you've, well, I mean, you're saying it
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:06.540]   absolutely the way that I wish everybody would say it,
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:10.140]   and certainly the way that I try to say it.
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:13.260]   And then the last bit, I think,
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.300]   ought to be put into the pattern,
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.840]   when we recognize that in measure, at any rate,
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:24.720]   we've done it, we just say, thank you,
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.280]   Heavenly Father, for enabling us to do it.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.840]   Say, Father, well, it was the Holy Spirit.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:37.000]   This is an area of reality in which the action
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.520]   of the Spirit doesn't impede, indeed,
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:46.140]   it strengthens and animates our action.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:52.380]   But we don't think of our action as, in any way,
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:57.140]   self-generated or self-sustained.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.940]   We know very well that the things we do that are right
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.800]   have been done by the Spirit,
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:10.100]   because we were walking by the Spirit,
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.900]   and they wouldn't have been done otherwise.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.900]   And so we certainly feel that we are doing it.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.700]   We know we are.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.020]   But at the same time, we know by faith
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.340]   we're being enabled to do it.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.020]   We started in asking to be enabled,
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.580]   and we shall finish by saying, thank you, Lord,
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.660]   for enabling me. >> That's very helpful.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.620]   Very helpful.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.820]   Let me take you in a new direction.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.740]   I've not heard anybody ask you this,
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.960]   and what, two, three days ago,
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.900]   there was a earthquake in Nepal,
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.580]   I think about 2,500 people have died.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:50.580]   So you and I are lovers of people
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.380]   and lovers of the sovereignty of God.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:59.300]   How do you articulate God's role in that earthquake?
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:07.140]   >> I go right back to the beginning and say,
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:13.120]   with all due respect to Christians who think otherwise,
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:19.780]   I don't believe this world was ever intended
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.320]   to be our final dwelling place.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:28.340]   I believe that it was always God's intention
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.500]   that His human creatures,
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:35.420]   having been tested and disciplined
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:40.420]   and so drilled into full-scale godliness in this world,
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:48.780]   would be taken, like Enoch was taken,
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:53.900]   into a world beyond.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:47:00.660]   I applaud the title of a sermon
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.720]   that Martin Lloyd-Jones preached
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.360]   and that was published and circulated widely as a tract,
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.800]   titled, and you can see from the title
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:13.360]   that all of this was being expressed in the sermon, it was,
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.980]   the title was God's Preparatory School.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:24.720]   That was how Martin Lloyd-Jones was urging us all
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.860]   to understand our present life.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.320]   Now, this world has been messed up
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:35.320]   as a result of sin in a way in which it wouldn't have been
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.360]   had sin not happened.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.960]   And it's beyond me to say
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:48.840]   whether there would have been the tests
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.000]   of living through earthquakes
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.940]   in a world where sin had not entered
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.800]   in the way that there is now,
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.760]   in the world as it is.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:08.840]   I believe that all these circumstances,
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.400]   however drastic and traumatic,
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:17.920]   are in fact to be understood by believers
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.920]   as so many tests in which we practice faithfulness
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:27.600]   to our God and experience God sustaining us
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.520]   and carrying us through.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:35.520]   And when these cosmic traumas
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.300]   bring about an early death, well,
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:44.300]   that now is God's will for the person who,
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.560]   or the persons who undergo that death.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.520]   And we can only say,
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.680]   God remains in charge and he knows what he's doing.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.120]   And if you ask me to cache that belief
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.840]   in terms of geology and physics,
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.040]   well, I can't do it.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.960]   I mean, tectonic plates--
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:06.800]   >> No, I wasn't asking that.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.840]   >> Or tectonic plates and so on.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.720]   There are so many things in life
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:15.840]   where you have that problem.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   I mean, you have a physical order of things,
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:27.220]   which it seems has always been out of man's control.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:33.680]   It's an order of things which now in this sinful world
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:41.380]   is used by God over and over as retributive judgment.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:49.900]   I'm thinking here, and this is just one thing,
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.340]   there are thousands that one could bring in,
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:56.780]   but I'm thinking of the way that Berlin
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.500]   got ruined and wrecked in the last days
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:01.980]   of the Second World War.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:08.300]   When Russia from one side and the Allies from the other side
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:13.020]   they advanced on Berlin,
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:18.020]   and just because of everything that was centered in Berlin,
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.300]   they messed up Berlin real good,
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:24.960]   if one may put it that way.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:34.100]   I'm sure that there were German believers in Berlin
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.740]   who lived through it, and all they could say is,
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.380]   well, God has done it, and they may have added,
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.140]   I'm beginning to suspect that we all deserved it.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.820]   And if, for instance, we continue in industrial life
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:51:01.020]   in a way that actually does produce major global warming
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.660]   in the way that they're warning us it might,
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:11.060]   well, that will mean certainly more storms,
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:16.620]   more natural disasters, more violence in the natural order,
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.460]   and there'll come a time when we shall have to whisper
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:26.340]   to ourselves, well, we brought it on ourselves,
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:31.280]   and in that sense we must accept responsibility for it.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:35.180]   But it's still under God's sovereignty,
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.940]   and the bottom line for every believer then,
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.860]   like the bottom line for every believer now must be,
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:46.300]   Lord, you know what you're doing, what you do is right.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:50.100]   If I fully understood it, I should see that.
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:54.660]   I don't fully understand it, so I walk by faith
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:59.060]   in your goodness and your wisdom, and step by step
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:03.700]   I seek to please you, starting, as it were, from now.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.500]   >> Just a brief-- >> You can't go further
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.340]   than that. >> A brief clarification.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.680]   It may be the most controversial thing anybody would say
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:14.680]   you've said so far is the belief that we were not intended
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.340]   to live our eternity on this earth.
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:19.880]   Relate that to the teachings of the new heavens
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.280]   and the new earth in Revelation or in Isaiah 65.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.940]   When you foresee, when you see a million years
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.940]   and all of history is over, where are we?
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:37.460]   >> Well, now, this is a matter under--
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:41.580]   >> Not too long now. >> No, no, but I must begin
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:44.140]   by saying this is a matter under discussion.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.860]   >> Yes, I just want to know Packer.
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.980]   >> Yes, learn, yes, all right.
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:52.380]   But there are learned men of evangelical persuasion,
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:57.120]   Bible believers, Bible lovers, taking different positions
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.320]   on this one, and I can't guarantee,
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.900]   this is what I wanted to say, I can't guarantee
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:07.900]   that I am properly wised up on the matter as yet.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:09.740]   I don't know whether I know enough,
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:16.460]   and that's what I would prefer to tell the world
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.700]   rather than to pontificate on one side or other
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:24.340]   of this question, but now, I think the thing
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.060]   that is certain from scripture,
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:33.380]   and that one way or another, both brands
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:38.900]   of evangelical scholars are trying to catch hold of
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.620]   at the same time, is that in some form,
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.340]   there will be continuity.
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.420]   >> Okay.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:50.420]   >> And having said that, I want to go on and say,
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:59.680]   I certainly believe that in all sorts of ways,
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:05.060]   it will be an enormously different order of things
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:09.500]   from that which we know now.
[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:13.900]   But then, putting my weight on the other foot, you see,
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:16.860]   I want to say that I am equally sure
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:21.860]   that in all sorts of ways, there will be perceived
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:26.980]   continuity, we shall never forget what this world was like,
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:31.060]   and we shall never forget our walk through it
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:36.060]   before we came to whatever is our final place of abode.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:46.700]   And what I can't say, though, is how we shall remember
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:52.420]   the past when things are so different in the present.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:58.420]   Now, that's a formula.
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.460]   I can't catch the formula, I'm not wise enough,
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:04.700]   I don't know enough, the Bible doesn't tell me enough.
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:09.700]   But I think that that is clearly, yes, clearly,
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:18.500]   what we are intended to learn from Revelation 20 and 21,
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.940]   well, 20, 21, 22, it's all three chapters.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.780]   >> Thank you.
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:25.740]   >> That is enough for you.
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.420]   >> It is enough, continuity is--
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.260]   >> How curious.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:30.940]   >> Continuity and discontinuity is pretty much all I,
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.100]   that's all I know, too.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.500]   We go, we're almost done, we're almost done,
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.020]   but I have one or two more.
[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:45.020]   One of the most painful issues today,
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:48.700]   and you have been significantly involved in it,
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:51.060]   is homosexuality.
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:56.660]   You took a stand that implied,
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:56:01.260]   and pretty explicitly stated, to bless a union,
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:05.620]   an ordination of a union, or just to bless,
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:10.620]   or celebrate, or embrace an active homosexual partnership
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:14.620]   was a gospel issue.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.180]   As I read your article in Christianity Today,
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.660]   you connected it.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:23.660]   So, things have intensified since then,
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:27.740]   and we are in a more aggressive situation
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:32.740]   of being asked to embrace, and celebrate, and endorse.
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:39.060]   How should we think about the importance of that issue
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.660]   and its relation to the gospel?
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:49.380]   >> Well, this is a hot potato, just as you were implying.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:56.780]   And, though I have taken a pretty forthright stand
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:03.700]   in black and white, shall I say,
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:07.700]   you affirm that, you're quite right, indeed I have.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:12.980]   I was put in a situation where I was forced to do that,
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:18.620]   because I was in an ecclesiastical structure
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:23.620]   that, in my estimate, was being led into major sin
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:28.940]   by totally disregarding what the Bible says so clearly
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:34.780]   about homosexual behavior.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:41.780]   And, well, in any situation of controversy,
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:48.340]   you have to speak as strongly as upholding the truth requires
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.060]   which may mean that you speak so strongly
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:56.060]   that you appear to be, how can I say it,
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:00.180]   to give more weight to the issue
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:05.020]   than in your own personal, pastoral, devotional ministry
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.140]   you actually do.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:14.660]   I'm not sure that I was led into doing that, in fact.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:20.120]   I do think that the issue is fundamental,
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:25.120]   and having spoken that preamble,
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.660]   I'll now try and answer your question and tell you just how.
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:37.860]   It seems to me that the procreation
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:42.120]   and continuance of the race
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.640]   was clearly the will of the creator
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.360]   when he made the first couple,
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.960]   made the world for them to live in.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:58.000]   And homosexual sex, whatever else one may say about it,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.240]   doesn't do that.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:06.240]   It misdirects the order of creation
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:11.400]   in a fundamental way.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:18.600]   Then, well, both Testaments,
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:21.640]   the whole Bible, I was going to say,
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:26.700]   is categorical, black and white,
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:32.240]   in its condemnation of homosexual behavior.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.200]   And in the Old Testament, of course,
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:38.180]   where the fundamentals of right and wrong are being taught,
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.480]   in the Pentateuch, anyway,
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.200]   where the people of God are given the law
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.960]   and led into the promised land.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.120]   Well, in the Pentateuch,
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:55.800]   homosexual behavior merits the death penalty.
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.360]   And I know that that is tough,
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:05.480]   'cause in the first days of teaching the law,
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:11.360]   the penalties were very heavy.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.880]   Penalties for things that would always be wrong,
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.440]   but they were very heavy penalties.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.080]   And that partly, I'm sure,
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.880]   was God teaching his people
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.420]   to have a conscience about things
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:31.000]   which the world around them didn't have a conscience about,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.200]   and which they wouldn't have had a conscience about
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.440]   had he not shot them, shaken them,
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:41.440]   by insisting that in the fellowship of Israel,
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.880]   this behavior is intolerable.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.000]   I will not have it.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.600]   Well, I think that that is a fact
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:01:01.920]   directly connected with God's purpose for sex
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.060]   and the procreation of the race.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:09.980]   I am talking about procreation incidentally
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:15.340]   with a consciousness that too much discussion
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.460]   about sex these days
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:21.300]   never gets around to discussing procreation.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:28.020]   God's wise plan was procreation with pleasure.
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:32.020]   But the context of the pleasure
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.500]   is intended to be the purpose of procreation.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:41.540]   At this point, I think the Catholic tradition has it right,
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:47.500]   and in the separation of procreation and pleasure
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.300]   and focusing exclusively on pleasure,
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:54.100]   a great deal of Protestant thinking
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:59.020]   about sex, gender, marriage, and so on has it wrong.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.920]   I would have to defend that, I know, in discussion.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.220]   But that's something I would be willing to do
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.820]   because I think it's clear
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:14.580]   from the foundational books of Scripture.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:19.940]   Pentateuch were all the foundations of everything are laid.
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:26.220]   >> Moving it towards the gospel.
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.060]   >> Yes.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:33.540]   Well, the gospel message and the gospel grace
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:40.540]   is intended to lead sinful human beings
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:47.640]   through the practice of discipleship
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.220]   and the powerful action of the Holy Spirit
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:56.980]   enabling us to do things right
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.080]   that we've been doing wrong before.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:05.480]   It's intended to bring us into the moral
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:10.180]   and spiritual image of Jesus our Lord.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:13.120]   Christlikeness isn't primarily physical.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.140]   It's primarily personal.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.660]   It has to do with character.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.240]   It has to do with outlook.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.060]   It has to do with mindset.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.980]   It has to do with the practice of love
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.540]   in all relationships.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:31.200]   Well, love and justice and wisdom.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:37.360]   All right, well, if that is so, and I believe it is,
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.420]   sanctioning homosexual behavior
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:47.660]   obstructs, counters, and messes up
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.900]   the work of sanctification.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:55.300]   And when we're told in debate
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:01.100]   that some people who practice homosexual relationship
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:08.220]   are ever so Christlike in this, that, and the other way,
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.440]   it's a confusion.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:15.620]   Just as one has to speak strongly
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:20.020]   when one's up against radical error
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.180]   and asked to sanction it,
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.660]   so one has to speak strongly
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.180]   when one's confronted with confusion
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:33.860]   and needs to sort out lines of thought
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.940]   that have got tangled.
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.100]   That's what I think we've got here.
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:45.300]   Well, the gospel has to do with
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:51.560]   the whole process that's involved
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.340]   in finding sinners,
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.220]   restoring them to fellowship with God
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:00.780]   from whom they've, on Him they've turned their backs,
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:04.080]   and renewing them in the image of Christ.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:09.080]   At this point, any sanctioning of homosexual behavior,
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:14.940]   any attempt to fit homosexual behavior in any form
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.920]   into the pattern of Christian discipleship
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.200]   is, seems to me, very radical confusion.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.440]   And the warrant for that would be
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.240]   First Corinthians 6, 9, and 10.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:32.600]   Yes, those are the verses on which I lay more emphasis
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.000]   than any others,
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.960]   although Romans chapter one in the middle
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.880]   comes pretty close.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.880]   But yes, the apostolic witness against homosexual behavior
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.720]   is absolutely categorical and strong.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.280]   And there in First Corinthians 6, 9, and 10,
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.480]   Paul says, "If you embrace it,
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:02.040]   "you must expect it to keep you out of the kingdom
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.480]   "because you're negating the gospel."
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.360]   So the, yeah, so the,
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.200]   what I was impressed with is--
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.800]   The gospel's a unity, and this is--
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.760]   The gospel is designed at enormous price
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.240]   to get people into the kingdom.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.240]   The apostles say this one--
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.080]   And out of sin.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.200]   And the others, greed, embracing greed
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.760]   and embracing idolatry will keep you out of the kingdom.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.400]   Therefore, to try to be a gospel person
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.920]   and a person embracing this sin are impossible.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.800]   Yes, impossible, incompatible.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:39.200]   And in our current culture,
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.600]   that needs to be shouted from the housetops
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.160]   because of the confusion about it,
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.520]   which infects our culture.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.920]   And shouting it from the housetops will be very costly.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.760]   Let me--
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.440]   Well, yes, and of course prudence,
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.280]   I mean, saying things in the way best calculated
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.200]   to get them hearing is also part of the equation here.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.600]   And when I talk about shouting from the housetops,
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.120]   there's a way in which you could understand that phrase,
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.960]   which I wouldn't.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.880]   I cannot picture J.I. Packer standing on a housetop
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.320]   shouting, but I can hear you saying pointed,
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.560]   appropriate, well-timed, powerful things as you just--
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.040]   Well, it's engaging people's minds
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.400]   and keeping them engaged while you make your points.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.360]   Let me close with this question.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:34.200]   You and I are old by standards of our culture.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.120]   You, a little older.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.680]   By any standards.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.360]   Okay, that's true.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:45.360]   Seven, three score, and then by reason of strength,
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:49.400]   seven, and that's where I am.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.600]   And you just outstripped it all.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.440]   Yes.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:57.560]   You have, along with the Puritans,
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:01.520]   drawn our attention to the beauties of Christ,
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:06.480]   the beauties of his salvation, the glories of God.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:11.480]   As you contemplate seeing him remarkably soon,
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:18.760]   what aspects of his person, character,
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:24.400]   are strengthening, bringing peace, joy to you now?
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:32.320]   What a good question.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:36.120]   Goes right to the heart and to the depths of the heart.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.160]   Yes.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.000]   Well, let me answer it as best I can.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.920]   I don't think of the Lord in terms of anything physical
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:56.560]   because I know that at that level, I can't focus him.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.520]   It's beyond me.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:05.280]   I think, try to keep thinking,
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.840]   of his wisdom.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.080]   Wisdom means a great deal to me.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.080]   His wisdom in seeing to the heart
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:24.280]   of those, everyone, with whom he's engaged.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.040]   Speaking to the heart,
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:34.080]   often introducing the person with whom he's engaged
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.840]   to him or herself in a way
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.240]   that they never yet have met themselves.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.840]   Like the rich young ruler, for instance,
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.440]   who thought he was a good chap
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.240]   until the Lord Jesus brought him,
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.720]   well, really brought him down in flames at that point.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.760]   Made him realize that discipleship
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.720]   is what it's supposed to be about
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.440]   and discipleship is something which, at heart level,
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   he hadn't begun.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.440]   Well, I think of the Lord Jesus
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.680]   as the searcher of my heart.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:18.720]   And whatever he, how do I say it, without seeming flip,
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:25.760]   whatever he looks like when I see him face to face,
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.920]   what I shall still, I think, value most,
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.360]   focus on most directly,
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:45.160]   take most interest in, dare I say it that way?
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:50.000]   Yes, I think so, is that he knows me through and through.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.880]   He knows my heart.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:58.520]   And just as it's humbling,
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.520]   to know that you can't hide anything from him,
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.920]   it's very salutary to know that.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:11.600]   And I hope that the awareness
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:17.480]   that he is the searcher of my heart
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:21.600]   will keep me, dare I say, humble.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:27.280]   No, if you venture to claim humility
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.280]   in any shape or form, the ax falls.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.440]   >> Yes, you may pursue it.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.320]   >> Yes, pursue it, yes, thank you, that's helpful.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:45.880]   I pursue it, but no, the Lord knows me better
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.120]   than I know myself still,
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:55.120]   although I think that through his ministry to me,
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.960]   I now know myself a great deal better than I did.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.560]   What shall I say?
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.200]   Well, it is actually 70 years ago when it started,
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:11.200]   and then I have known myself various points of the past.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.760]   That's the best answer I can give you,
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.600]   and if it doesn't sound exciting, well, I'm sorry,
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.320]   I can't be exciting about the Lord searching my heart.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.840]   I just tell you that as far as I'm concerned
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.560]   is central to what it's all about, 'cause he's changing me.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.560]   >> In Psalm 92, at the end, there is a word to old people.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:47.080]   The righteous will bear fruit in old age.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:51.080]   They will remain, be full of sap and green
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:57.200]   to testify that the Lord is upright.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:03.200]   So I wanna close by thanking you for 70 years plus
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:09.440]   of declaring that the Lord is good, the Lord is sovereign,
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.940]   the Lord is sufficient, the Lord is beautiful,
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:16.200]   the Lord is the searcher of our hearts,
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.640]   and that the Lord is upright.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.800]   You've been a faithful witness,
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.100]   and we thank God for it.
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:29.720]   >> Thank you for the kindness with which you say that.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:36.400]   Yes, I was reading Psalm 92 only two days ago,
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.720]   or was it three, very recently anyway,
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.720]   and finding much encouragement, actually,
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.040]   in those very words that you quoted.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.120]   >> Thank you.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.600]   I've enjoyed our conversation,
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.560]   and if you've enjoyed it too,
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.260]   well, let us praise the Lord together.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:03.160]   >> Father, thank you for Dr. J.I. Packer,
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.680]   and the manifest delight he has in you,
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:11.680]   your ways, your work, even your humbling searching
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:16.240]   of his and our hearts.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.720]   Bless his remaining days.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:24.720]   Fill him with energy, health, wisdom, insight,
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.360]   love, joy, hope, and use him mightily
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:34.720]   as you have in the past, I pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:35.560]   >> Amen.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:41.480]   And I would pray that John Piper's ministry,
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:47.920]   which you have made so rich and honored so widely
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.480]   in so many good ways,
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:56.680]   may continue, continue in strength for many years yet
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:03.900]   as he leads disciples to desire you,
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:10.120]   to love Christ, to love their fellows,
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.200]   to stand for the truth,
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.800]   and to practice all the aspects of the discipleship
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.480]   to which you call us in your word.
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:27.920]   Thank you, Father, for John Piper and his ministry.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:31.240]   Bless it greatly in years to come.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.880]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.720]   >> Amen.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.480]   >> Amen.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.880]   That was John Piper interviewing Dr. J.I. Packer
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.940]   in Vancouver in April of 2015.
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:47.860]   Dr. Packer's stomach was always growling, it seemed,
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:50.280]   and you heard it a few times in this recording
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.040]   if you were wondering what that was.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.720]   What a metabolism that man had.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.760]   And what a precious gift from God he was to us,
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.280]   a desiring God as well.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.720]   We will miss him.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:01.960]   And by now you likely already know
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.640]   that on the morning of July 17th,
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.040]   Dr. Packer met face-to-face the Savior
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.480]   who knew him better than he knew himself.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.860]   Dr. Packer was 93.
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:14.360]   Thank you for listening to this special long-form episode
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.680]   of the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.160]   Pastor John and I will see you next time.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.200]   Thanks for listening.
