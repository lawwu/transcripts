[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.560]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.180]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.020]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.300]   and I love to travel.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.640]   And even more, I love optimizing that travel
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.380]   to have the best experience at the lowest cost.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.800]   And one country that's at the top of my list,
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.340]   and many of yours who've emailed in, is Italy.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.280]   Now, technically I've been to Italy before,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.260]   but Amy and I did Rome and Venice for two days each
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.240]   back in college almost 20 years ago.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.060]   So at this point, it almost feels like I've never been.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.920]   And I couldn't think of anyone better to join me
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620]   for this episode than my good friend
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.360]   and guest from episode one, Lee Rowan,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.760]   who runs a travel company called Savanti,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.280]   and has been to Italy 40 to 50 times.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760]   So many, he actually lost track of the count.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.880]   We're gonna talk about the places to go,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.800]   the spectacular cuisine, the gorgeous coastlines,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.780]   ancient ruins, and some of Italy's rich history.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.900]   We'll also get to some of Lee's favorite
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.480]   off the beaten path locations
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.800]   for an authentically local experience,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.480]   and hear why he thinks life
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.880]   is just that much better in Italy.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.160]   Finally, we're gonna dive into some of the best ways
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.920]   you can use your points and miles for your trip to Italy,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.680]   including a quick overview of a new site I've been using
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.380]   to help you get the best hotel deals with points.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.480]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.160]   Do you all remember episode 122,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.480]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.660]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.680]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.120]   but one of his top hacks
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.600]   was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.040]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.760]   but after getting a full set
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.940]   of microwave cookware from Anyday,
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.540]   I am a total convert,
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.640]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.920]   for this episode.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.960]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.240]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.580]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code,
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.600]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.200]   The cookware is 100% plastic free,
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.160]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.720]   all in the same dish
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.520]   that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.160]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.340]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.640]   so you should definitely check that out.

[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.840]   - Lee, thank you for being here.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   Round three, you get to take the title
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.240]   as most visited guest.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.120]   You already had it, but now you get it again.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.680]   - Thank you for having me here in this new setup you have.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.840]   I'm looking around, it's really quite impressive.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.240]   Beautiful job you've done.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.160]   - Yeah, I took this course, dreamstudiocourse.com
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.080]   that this guy Kevin Chen created,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.760]   and you'll get a better view
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.360]   if you're watching this on YouTube than listening,
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.280]   'cause you can't really see it.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.120]   You'll get an even better view
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.080]   when I start to actually record in a couple days
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.580]   with a virtual thing, because that was what I optimized for.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.640]   But there is now an in-studio option for all the hacks,
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.000]   which we have here.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.840]   - It's very cool, very cool.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.600]   Thank you for inviting me in here to chat
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.680]   about one of my favorite places in the entire world.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.920]   - Yeah, so I am excited because we started with London,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.440]   because I was going on a trip and I wanted to figure it out,
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.280]   and then we dove into Japan,
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.000]   which actually, now that I think about it,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.960]   Brandon Presser made his second appearance.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.320]   And now we're talking Italy,
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.800]   which I'm really excited about
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.440]   because I was about to go to London.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.280]   I had been to Japan a lot.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.360]   And Italy, I went on the few days
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.200]   after our college whirlwind trip,
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.580]   but it's a trip that we wanna take.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.160]   And it's not gonna happen this year,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.480]   but it's gonna happen in the future.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.760]   And I'm really excited to dive in.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.560]   I don't know a lot, so I'm glad we have the expert here.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.200]   - Yeah, well, I appreciate you inviting me, of course,
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.880]   and giving me this chance to chat about something
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.440]   that is truly one of my favorite places
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.240]   for people, for food, for culture, for beauty, for sights.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.640]   I mean, we could chat for much longer than this podcast
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.600]   will go about everything that's great in Italy.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.400]   So I'm excited to dive into your questions
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.760]   and share some of my own passion.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.760]   - So why do you keep going back?
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.600]   What is it?
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   I mean, you just listed a bunch of things,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.360]   but what makes Italy such a unique travel place?
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.280]   - Yeah, well, I've been to 70 countries.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.240]   I've been very fortunate to go all seven continents
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.400]   around the world.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.640]   And the thing that makes me feel most at home in Italy
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.920]   is just that the Italians know how to live.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.200]   They know how to live life.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.360]   Great food, great wine, great coffee,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.360]   but more than all of that,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.960]   it's just this continual enjoyment of life.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.000]   There's the evening passeggiata, where people walk.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.400]   Everywhere you can go, you walk, which is incredible.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.880]   Big cities, small cities, everyone walks,
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.920]   but they're out and about,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.880]   and they're walking from cafe to cafe.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.120]   They're seeing friends, they're being social.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.640]   No one's in a hurry, no one's in a rush.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.320]   No one's off to catch the next thing.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.720]   They're just there living in the moment, being.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.640]   And if you look at that as a narrative example
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.840]   of how you can live, right?
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.360]   These people have been doing this for thousands of years,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.760]   3,000 years of civilization in Italy,
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.920]   where they're just being.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.160]   There's no greater thing to do or to-do list
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.200]   or all these things that keep us busy here at home.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.520]   It's just being.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.920]   And that, for me, is so refreshing.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.600]   So I feel like I have to go back and back
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.880]   to get another taste of that every chance I get.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.040]   And of course, the food.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.360]   When I'm there, I'm tasting that too.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.640]   And it's incredible, the diversity and the ability
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.360]   of the Italian cuisine to take these wonderful things
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.480]   from their natural abundant resources,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.920]   the sea, the mountains, their fields,
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.040]   and turn them into these masterpieces on the table.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.520]   - Okay, so I think one of the things
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.000]   I'm just gonna preface everyone to consider,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.720]   which is a lot of times people travel
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.880]   and they say, "I gotta go do this."
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.440]   It sounds like a big attraction in Italy
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.600]   is learning to kind of relax and enjoy what you're doing.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.240]   So maybe that's a theme that we'll just kind of keep here,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.000]   which is as much as we might talk about
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.320]   lots of cool things to see and don't feel like
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   need to spend every single moment of every single day doing.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.520]   - That is 100%.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.360]   The biggest takeaway I think people can take
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.800]   from this podcast is the discussion of be here now
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.860]   in the moment, the place that you are in Italy,
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.920]   knowing that you're, yeah,
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.500]   you're not gonna see all the rest of it.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.880]   Like I've been to Italy 40 or 50 times,
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.720]   I forgot the count.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.440]   And what's crazy is that out of all of the 20 Italian
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.960]   regions that there are, I'm still missing a few of them
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.840]   after having been there 40 times.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.660]   And so I, an Italophile, somebody who loves going to Italy,
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.280]   speaking Italian, eating Italian food,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.440]   seeing Italian culture, I still haven't seen it all.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.520]   And I will never see it all
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.040]   because there's such a diversity in that country.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.000]   60 plus million people, you know,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.800]   it's the fifth most visited country in the world,
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.080]   but there is still so much to see that people don't scratch
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.440]   beyond the surface and see when they do their Rome,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.520]   Florence, Venice trip, and they think they've seen Italy.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.120]   You've seen three cities in Italy,
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.760]   come back and see everything, come see a lot more.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.080]   - Well, I think most people listening probably won't
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.680]   in their lifetime make 40 trips to Italy.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.240]   So it sounds wonderful,
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.160]   but let's just talk high level.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.040]   Someone wants to go to Italy
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.600]   and it's impossible to see it all,
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.680]   but nobody or most people don't have 10 weeks a year
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.520]   to go spend in Italy,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.820]   which I'm sure if they did, you would highly recommend,
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.360]   but maybe they've got a week or two and they're like,
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.200]   I want to go see Italy.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.480]   I want to experience what you're talking about.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.680]   How would you suggest they start to approach it?
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.540]   Or what are a few different approaches?
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.880]   - Yeah, great question.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.600]   So I think the first thing to realize and understand
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.520]   is that no approach is the right approach.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.560]   There are so many different ways of seeing Italy.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.360]   If you look at it as like a matrix, right?
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.760]   All the different cities, all the different sites,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.400]   all the different reasons for visiting.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.320]   And you could go just see museums
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.800]   and be busy for 10 days in Rome alone.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.160]   Or you could do the Rome, Venice, Florence,
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.120]   tour, Milan tour of all the museums
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.600]   or all the churches and historical sites
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.720]   and still not see all of the highlights
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.400]   that you could see in 10 days.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.520]   So I think knowing that you're going into it,
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.860]   leaving a lot on the table,
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.960]   leaving things to come back and visit in the future
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.040]   is great.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.800]   The second idea is knowing that it's really easy
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.400]   to burn out on too much eating, too much museuming,
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.240]   too much churching as you go to Italy.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.880]   And so building a nice mix in an itinerary
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.440]   is a really important thing to do.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.240]   So where do I find inspiration?
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.720]   There's a lot of really great media right now
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.400]   that focuses on an aspect of Italian culture or life.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.580]   You know, Stanley Tucci has been doing
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.920]   for the past two years, his sort of "Torte Italia"
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.320]   and he's going to all 20 regions
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.440]   and he's eating his way through.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.940]   And if you look at the way that he's approached
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.360]   his episodes, these hour long sort of opus,
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.960]   these hour long bits of love to Lazio where Rome is,
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.200]   or Campania where they grow the tomatoes
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.220]   that become your pizza tomatoes here in the States.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.600]   You look at him really getting to know a people
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.200]   and a culture and a place,
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.080]   something that he's very familiar with already,
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.300]   but through the lens of food and culture.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.820]   And that's a wonderful approach for people to take
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.240]   is they find some angle that they love,
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.600]   whether it's in a book or a TV series,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.800]   and they say, "Hey, I want to go recreate
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.780]   an element of that on my trip."
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.680]   So I want to go to the place where Stanley Tucci
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.560]   finds the tomato in the field of San Marzano
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.680]   and says, "Okay, I found the real tomato.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.040]   Now I know what it's supposed to taste like."
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.800]   That's a centerpiece for their trip.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.440]   But there are so many blogs that are out there.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.200]   There's so many travel advisors willing to help.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.360]   There's so many books you can read
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.440]   about everything to eat, see, and do in Italy.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.240]   My biggest takeaway for people again is take your time
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.720]   and know that you're not going to see it all.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.220]   You're not going to do it all.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.760]   And you're going to have an amazing time
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.060]   in the process of whatever you do, see, and do.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.660]   - So I feel like I'm both more excited to go to Italy
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.380]   and I have no idea what I should do
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.540]   with a week and a trip.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.740]   Maybe give some options.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.000]   I'm thinking one to two weeks,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.780]   maybe let's throw out two or three things
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.300]   that you might send someone to.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.780]   Is Roma must include on any first trip to Italy?
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.980]   - In my opinion, yes.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.340]   All roads lead to Rome for good reason, right?
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.560]   Look, it's the third most visited city in all of Europe.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.700]   To me, it is a place that is happy and fun
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.580]   and lively and young and still so very old,
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.020]   full of incredible cuisine,
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.220]   full of some of the best historical sites in the world.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.420]   Look, to me, the fact that they could build the Pantheon,
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.100]   this concrete domed roof with an open hole
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.980]   in the oculus in the center,
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.680]   2000 years ago and it's still standing.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.900]   It's still standing, it's like mind blowing.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.500]   Like we can't build a road here.
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.500]   They can build a 2000 years ago,
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.200]   a dome that is in the center of town that is remarkable.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.640]   And so when you see that, you have a sense of awe
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.580]   that returns to you,
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.660]   whether you've been there 40 times or this is the first.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.380]   So I think Rome is absolutely an incredible place to go.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.280]   Go see the sites, go see the touristy sites
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.980]   that are overcrowded, the Colosseum, Vatican,
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.740]   because they really are monuments to humanity
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.980]   and to an incredible society that has built
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.460]   and upkept these buildings for 2000 years.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.180]   But also get lost, go off the beaten path in Rome
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.620]   and don't just go to the fancy gelateria
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.060]   across from the Trevi Fountain.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.660]   It's beautiful, it's great for Instagram,
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.900]   but go wind through the streets of Trastevere,
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.820]   across the river where the Romans live
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.140]   and the Romans go eat and explore that little village
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.420]   and see what it's like to be in a little borgo,
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.320]   a little village inside of a big metropolitan city.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.820]   Have a meal on a piazza where maybe you're the only person
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.060]   who doesn't speak fluent Italian, that's okay.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.260]   You're gonna be welcomed in,
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.140]   you're gonna eat an incredible meal
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.100]   and you're gonna see the way that the sweetness
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.380]   of doing nothing passes by in front of you on passeggiata
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.380]   as people are walking from the cafe to the restaurant,
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.540]   to their home and beyond.
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.860]   - Okay, so that's Rome.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.500]   So let's say I wanna do Rome and something else.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.480]   What are a few options?
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.540]   - Well, from Rome within, if you draw like a big circle,
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.260]   you say, I wanna take a two hour train ride from Rome.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.640]   You've got a ton of options, North and South.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.460]   Traditionally, people would go South to the Amalfi Coast.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.500]   It's incredible, it's iconic, it's beautiful.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.380]   It's been made famous since movies in the 50s, right?
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.460]   Where you're driving along these mountainside roads
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.920]   and there's a sheer cliff 500 feet down
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.780]   and beautiful beaches and incredible food and wine.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.140]   That's amazing, it really is.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.140]   Amalfi, the downside to it
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.500]   is that everyone wants to be there.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.260]   So that coast between, let's say,
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.220]   June and early September is a zoo.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.260]   What is normally a 20 minute ride in a car or a bus
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.860]   could be an hour and a half stuck in traffic on a one lane.
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.300]   That's a bummer when you're on a limited vacation time.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.580]   So what I would recommend is go to Amalfi,
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.220]   but maybe go in May or go in late September or October.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.460]   The weather is still amazing,
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.280]   you can experience it and that's wonderful.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.660]   So another piece to take away from the conversation
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.260]   is seasonality.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.580]   You can always go to Rome, Rome is happening year round.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.340]   Harder to go to a beach in November,
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.980]   but the Amalfi Coast in October is still really lovely
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.420]   and you'll have a third of the crowds
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.740]   that are there throughout the year.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.460]   Nearby Amalfi, you've got Naples,
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.900]   you've got Pompeii or Ercanuleo,
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.020]   which is the nearby town that's like a mini Pompeii
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.420]   that has incredible ruins that are really not visited.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.260]   You can go walk amongst 2000 year old homes
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.900]   that were damaged in the ash from Vesuvius in 79 AD
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.580]   and you can just walk around and there's no one around you.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.300]   Whereas in Pompeii, it can be pretty busy.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.220]   So there's little alternatives to each place
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.740]   along the way that you should try to explore.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.020]   But if you don't wanna go south, you can always go north.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.240]   Florence is only an hour and 20 minute train ride from Rome.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.400]   There's trains that leave every 15 minutes.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.540]   It's an incredible town.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.340]   It's like a medieval village that still comes alive today.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.420]   And I actually studied abroad there
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.580]   and did culinary school there in 2003,
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.180]   a little while ago.
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.620]   And it was just an incredible place to be young,
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.160]   to be alive and to be living in a medieval city of today.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.300]   So great sights and sounds, amazing food.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.980]   If you like pork, that is your city.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.940]   If you like red wine, that is your region.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.320]   And there's a ton to do.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.460]   But let's say you've done Rome and you've done Florence.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.500]   What do you do on your second or third trip back to Italy?
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.540]   Most of your flights are gonna fly either into Rome
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.300]   or into Milan in the north.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.140]   That's where most of the flights
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.380]   from North America tend to land.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.420]   So what I like to do is get off the beaten path
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.100]   and explore other areas that are maybe less popular
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.340]   with North American tourists,
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.740]   but still to me pack authenticity,
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.340]   incredible food and great experiences into a small area.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.360]   So something to consider might be Umbria,
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.460]   the green heart of Italy that's right next to Tuscany.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.300]   You have 2000 year old villages there.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.440]   In fact, sometimes even older to the Etruscan age.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.160]   You've got incredible food and wine
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.620]   and you've got a third of the tourists that are in Tuscany.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.500]   And you're probably paying half
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.200]   to three quarters of the price as well.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.800]   So that's a wonderful place if you feel confident
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.020]   and you're okay to get off the beaten path by yourself.
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.760]   Even if you don't speak Italian,
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.940]   you can get by in Umbria, eat, drink, and see well,
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.220]   and go see some incredible sights and sounds
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.060]   that are unlike anywhere else in the world.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:15.080]   The last plug I'll make for Umbria, by the way, May 15th.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.300]   Every year, my favorite festival
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.720]   in the whole world takes place.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.580]   It's called the Corsa di Ceri.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.820]   What that means is the running of the candles.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.060]   You think running of the candles,
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.900]   how does that candle blows out when you run?
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.820]   None of that, how does that work?
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.460]   These crazy people in this town of Gubbio,
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.420]   they take these huge wooden slats.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.480]   They're like 30 feet long.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.140]   And a bunch of husky men hold onto them.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.420]   And on top of the slats are these big,
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.460]   tall columns with a saint on top.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.420]   And they run these candles through the town,
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.580]   through the medieval town.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.500]   And the walls of the buildings next to you
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.940]   are like encroaching upon these candles
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.100]   as you run through the streets.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.860]   And they sing songs and they play trumpets and music.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.180]   And it's insane.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.300]   It's a party and no one outside of Italy goes there.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.420]   It's like not like it's a running of the bulls
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.260]   or the Tomatera in Spain.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.500]   It's like this true Italian festival
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.940]   in the heart of Umbria.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.060]   I've only been twice.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.500]   I would love to go back again.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.660]   'Cause it's, to me, it's the most exciting element
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.780]   of seeing people in their thing, doing their thing,
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.700]   living their lives, celebrating their history and culture
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.820]   and having a blast doing it.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.660]   - You said a couple times,
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.500]   even if you don't speak Italian,
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.340]   should anyone be nervous going to Italy
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.820]   if they speak no Italian?
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.900]   - No, because the Italians are the kindest, nicest people.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.460]   And I say that as a overarching stereotype.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.260]   You're gonna have your bad apples for sure.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.500]   But the people who work in trades
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.100]   that tourists are going to be engaging with,
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.020]   restaurateurs, cafe owners, cafe workers,
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.940]   transportation people, et cetera,
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.340]   are really excited that a big lifeblood
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.540]   of the Italian economy, tourism, is back.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.340]   During COVID, Italy was one of the places
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.780]   that locked down the hardest in Europe.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.260]   And it was tough for Italians to even leave their homes.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.180]   Now that you can leave your home,
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.300]   the Italians are so excited to have work again,
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.900]   to have an influx of tourists again, and to see people.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.540]   Look, in 2019, there were 65 million tourists
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.220]   that came to Italy, okay?
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.660]   2022, that number was down by about a third.
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.260]   And 2022 was the busiest year for tourism
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.660]   since COVID, obviously.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.940]   So that's quite a difference,
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.020]   going from 65 million to about 40 million
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.420]   in terms of tourists.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.140]   The tourism is huge for a country of 60 million
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.500]   that really relies on tourist dollars
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.020]   and tourist euros, I guess.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.300]   So getting by without Italian is totally fine.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.780]   You may end up in these off the beaten path hill towns
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.780]   where they get fewer tourists.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.860]   You may end up doing the whole pointing thing,
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.780]   the shrugging your shoulders thing
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.620]   when you don't know a word, and that's totally okay.
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.500]   The Italians roll with the punches and they love that.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.660]   So I would not feel worried at all
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.300]   about not speaking the language.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.100]   Instead, I would, maybe if you have a few hours
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.140]   before you go, study up on Duolingo
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.580]   or brush up on learning some Italian phrases online.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.820]   A little bit of Italian will go a long way.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.660]   And you'll never have to worry about feeling
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.420]   like you have no idea what you're saying.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.140]   - Any other kind of cultural norms worth calling out
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.300]   so people kind of fit in and don't stand out
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.100]   like American tourists sometimes can?
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.780]   - Yeah, don't try to make a 6 p.m. dinner reservation.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:14.620]   (laughing)
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.260]   The Italians, they're not the Spaniards
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.900]   where they're eating at 11 o'clock at night,
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.300]   but they're not far off.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.340]   They do eat on a different schedule
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.100]   than North Americans typically do.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.900]   So breakfast is lighter.
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.580]   It's a cappuccino, coffee of some sort,
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.340]   and a croissant or a piece of bread.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.860]   A lunch is a big affair, and it can go on sometimes
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.580]   for two or even three hours.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.380]   But dinner will take place usually very late.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.900]   And seven o'clock is the absolute earliest people eat
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.820]   in the winter.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.600]   In the summer, it's even pushed to eight or sometimes nine.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.260]   So if you're walking around and you see the restaurant
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.740]   and it says they open up at 2100,
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.980]   don't think that it's like a nightclub.
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.100]   It's actually just their standard business hours for dinner.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.580]   And when we were there with even young kids,
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.500]   this summer, we would eat at like 8.30, nine o'clock,
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.100]   and we'd be finishing our meal at 10.30 or 11,
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.060]   and there'd be families with our kids' ages
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.380]   sitting down for dinner at 11 o'clock,
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.420]   which is really crazy.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.420]   - Do people sleep in, or how do they make this work?
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.020]   - They do, they sleep in and they take a pausa pranzo.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.920]   They take a big gap for lunch.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.020]   So if you're working in an office, let's say,
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.500]   from about 12.30 or one, oh, about three o'clock,
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.140]   maybe a little later, you're kind of out of the office.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.780]   People are either eating a long lunch, they're napping,
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.580]   they're just not working, they're going for that pasta giata,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.420]   whatever they're doing.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.100]   But people do tend to take a gap in the middle of the day.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.900]   - And so you went with young kids.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.340]   Did you just kind of change the time schedule
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.260]   so that they were just up later and sleep in later?
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.300]   - You have to, yeah.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.060]   And we mandated a family nap, not just kid nap,
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.260]   but a family nap every afternoon.
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.960]   'Cause in the summer in particular,
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.060]   depending on where you are, it can be very hot.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.260]   So having a midday nap was a nice thing.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.220]   But it would be amazing.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.580]   We'd see kids out at 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock at night.
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.300]   And then those same kids would be up at like 9.30
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.140]   in the morning.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.940]   And I'm like, how do you do it?
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.700]   - Easy to meet local Italians.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.500]   What's the vibe like between tourists and locals
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.860]   when it comes to meeting each other,
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.700]   trying to make friends with locals
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.900]   and kind of get a true authentic local experience?
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.740]   - Yeah.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.180]   So I would say the more of an authentic
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.460]   and local place you're in,
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.340]   the more likely you are to meet Italians.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.580]   And what I mean by that is Piazza Navona in Rome,
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.020]   one of the most incredible piazzas that there is.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.340]   Beautiful fountains in the middle
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.660]   and benches all around that
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.300]   and restaurants circling the entire piazza.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.380]   And it's an incredible place,
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.820]   but it's not built for Romans.
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.980]   It's built for tourists.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.700]   Romans go there, but if you wanted to meet Romans,
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.740]   you're gonna meet them in the piazza
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.460]   around Santa Maria in Trassevere,
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.100]   the place I mentioned earlier, Trassevere.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.980]   You're gonna meet tourists in tourist places.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.820]   You're gonna meet Europeans or Italians in particular
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.660]   in their neighborhood, where they are.
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.820]   So what I would recommend is choose the opportunities
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.700]   to meet with people and seek them out and go find them,
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.780]   because you will find them and people will want to meet you.
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.780]   They'll wanna hear your story.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:03.620]   Where are you from?
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.460]   Why are you here?
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.060]   They're so proud to show off their neighborhood
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.780]   or their city or their country.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.620]   And so when they hear,
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.020]   "Wow, you're Californian, amazing.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.420]   "I've always dreamed of going to California,"
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.980]   is the thing that they'll say.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.980]   And then they'll be so proud to show you their piazza.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.620]   They'll be so happy that you're there.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.300]   So find the Romans in their neighborhoods.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.420]   Find the Italians in their cities,
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.100]   not necessarily at the tourist traps.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.940]   - And how are you getting around Italy?
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.500]   Are you flying into one city and renting a car?
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.620]   You mentioned the train.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.900]   I know you could probably even fly between cities.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.300]   - The trains run pretty well.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.220]   I mean, Mussolini did that whole thing, I guess.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.860]   He electrified and brought trains everywhere.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.660]   And there was some dilapidation after that.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.620]   And the trains nowadays don't run perfectly,
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.860]   but they're fairly reliable.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.660]   So I would say to take a train as much as you can.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.020]   You definitely don't need to drive a car
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.820]   if you're going from city to city to city.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.740]   When you get into the country, the trains don't run.
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.820]   And so buses run or private car transfers
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.740]   are very simple and easy to set up.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.380]   If you're gonna be staying in Tuscany or Umbria
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.460]   and you're gonna wanna explore from your hotel
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.300]   or your villa, absolutely rent a car.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.460]   Driving in Italy is interesting.
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.660]   It's easy, but I would take caution as you drive
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.900]   because Italian drivers can be a little aggressive.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.340]   Nothing to be scared about or worried about.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.820]   There's no road rage.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.700]   They're just gonna pass you by
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.380]   because you're going too slow.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.220]   That's fine.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.180]   Italian towns tend to be very small
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.900]   and roadways even smaller.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.660]   So when you drive from town to town,
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.700]   it may be hard for you to find parking inside the town walls.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.940]   Just park outside and walk in.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.780]   It's easy.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.540]   It's better than trying to navigate your rental car
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.900]   through medieval streets that were really meant
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.540]   for cows and sheep, not for humans and not for cars.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.020]   You don't wanna have that on your car insurance bill.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.380]   But as a general rule, it's easy to get around in Italy.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.460]   When you plan ahead and you know the train schedules
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.740]   from city to city, and then from there,
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.900]   if you need to take a taxi or a car rental.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.020]   - I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.500]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.100]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.740]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.140]   as you build your wealth.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.420]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.260]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.420]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.940]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.940]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.340]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.300]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.900]   and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.740]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.100]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.820]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.620]   are first generation wealth,
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.700]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.860]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.180]   and learn from each other
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.780]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.060]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.400]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.820]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.980]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.960]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.440]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.880]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.220]   to your children's education,
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.540]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.980]   So many of these conversations
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.200]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.860]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.740]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.900]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.980]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.100]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.620]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.580]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:26.660]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.820]   This holiday season,
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.900]   I wanna give gifts to my loved ones
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.860]   that make them feel special and unique,
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.200]   just like the relationships we share.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.460]   If you feel the same way,
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.180]   you should be giving them StoryWorth,
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.660]   which is an incredible gift
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.380]   I've given to the people I care about,
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.740]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.540]   StoryWorth is an online service
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.840]   that helps you and your loved ones
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.300]   preserve precious memories and stories for years to come.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.220]   It's a thoughtful and meaningful gift
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.540]   that connects you to those who matter most.
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.300]   Each week, StoryWorth emails your relative or friend
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.540]   a thought-provoking question of your choice
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.580]   from a vast pool of options.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.420]   Each unique prompt asks a question
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.700]   you've never thought about,
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.700]   like what's the bravest thing you've ever done,
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.500]   or if you could see into the future,
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.580]   what would you want to find out?
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.740]   After a year, StoryWorth will compile
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.340]   all of your loved one's stories,
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.420]   including photos, into a beautiful keepsake book
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.180]   that you'll be able to share and revisit
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.100]   for generations to come, which, now that we have kids,
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.420]   I couldn't be more excited
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.100]   to start collecting these books to share with them.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.100]   Reading the weekly stories helps connect you
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.420]   with loved ones no matter how near or far apart you are,
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.820]   and you'll be surprised at the things you learn,
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.380]   like how my dad might have gotten into trouble
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.100]   for landing a helicopter at Denny's
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.900]   back when he was in the military.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.940]   With StoryWorth, I'm giving those I love
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.500]   most a thoughtful, personal gift from the heart
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.880]   and preserving their memories and stories for years to come.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.060]   Go to allthehacks.com/storyworth
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.400]   to save $10 on your first purchase.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.580]   That's allthehacks.com/storyworth
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.540]   to save $10 on your first purchase.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.880]   So you said plan ahead.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.380]   You and I both like saving money.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.460]   Let's say you're planning a trip,
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.980]   you've kind of figured out your itinerary.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.420]   What are you thinking you should do ahead of time?
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.580]   Any way to get a deal,
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.140]   whether it's transportation, flights, lodging,
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.200]   what are you thinking about?
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.200]   - Yeah, so it definitely goes to say
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.300]   that the places you know you want to go, book in advance.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.220]   So that goes for hotels.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.940]   It's obviously a lot cheaper to book in advance
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.340]   for most of these hotels.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.380]   You can book a non-refundable rate with a lot of them
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.940]   and then it'll save 10 to 20%.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.460]   You can also call a hotel ahead of time and say,
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.780]   "Hey, listen, I see you've got a non-refundable thing online.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.260]   What if I went even further and said,
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.540]   'I don't need breakfast'?"
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.340]   They might even do a bigger deal with you for that
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.180]   if you're interested.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.540]   But booking ahead is very important
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.220]   for hotel trains in particular.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.340]   Your trains will be allowable to book
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.260]   between 30 and 60 days out in Italy,
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.200]   depending on the train line you're on.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.820]   And typically the cheapest rates are 30 to 60 days out,
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.040]   but highly recommend that.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.060]   Also recommend restaurant reservations.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.060]   At places you must go, book them in advance.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.040]   But don't book every night.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.300]   Give yourself some flexibility
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.220]   on what spontaneously might happen,
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.200]   what you want to pop into, where you want to go, et cetera.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.500]   The places that you have to go,
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.100]   like the Pier Luigi in Rome or Osteria Francescana
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.940]   if you can get in, and Modena, book those.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.420]   Build your trip around them if you need to.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.100]   But when you're in a place,
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.700]   don't have every single meal booked
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.340]   because you may want to have that spontaneity
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.600]   to just eat a bunch of prosciutto on the side of the road
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.480]   'cause it's really good and it's there.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.240]   - So we talked a little bit about restaurants.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.420]   Broadly speaking, when someone's doing research,
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.180]   is there a reliable site for Italy
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.300]   to figure out where to go what's good
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.780]   or what do you recommend?
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.680]   - Yeah, so I use a couple sites
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.160]   as a travel advisor myself
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.340]   when I'm trying to figure out new and upcoming places
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.280]   to check out or to send people.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.320]   The first is that the Italians have their own Michelin guide.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.760]   It's called the Gambaro Rosso, the red shrimp.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.000]   And Gambaro Rosso is like the Bible
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.520]   for food and wine in Italy.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.120]   They have a fork rating.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.040]   So if you get forks, it's a legit place, right?
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.840]   You should go up to three, I believe,
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.360]   or maybe it's four, I have to double check.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.000]   But anyway, the more forks, the merrier, obviously.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.340]   So check out Gambaro Rosso.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.360]   It oftentimes isn't only in Italian,
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.840]   so you might have to use Google Translate
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.040]   to figure out what's going on.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.120]   But that's a great place to find
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.080]   off the beaten path restaurants.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.040]   Look, in a big city like Rome or Milan,
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.240]   any international, whether it's the New York Times
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.960]   or the Michelin guide or even food blogs you've read,
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.760]   they're all gonna have the same general information.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.160]   But when you're going off the beaten path,
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.960]   Gambaro Rosso is incredible.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.320]   And actually, I find the most joy in smaller Italian towns.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.840]   And I find that if you just go a little outside
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.900]   of the tourist envelope,
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.600]   you can have these incredible culinary experiences
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.840]   that are half the price sometimes of the tourist bubbles,
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.460]   but they're so much richer and more meaningful
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.960]   and more connected to the area.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.760]   An example, I love the Cinque Terre.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.200]   It's one of the top spots to see in the north of Italy
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.520]   on the Italian Riviera in the Liguria state.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.240]   The borders basically goes from almost Pisa
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.940]   all the way over to the French border.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.400]   And it's this little horseshoe on the Italian coast.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.160]   It's stunningly gorgeous.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.000]   You've got the five towns of the Cinque Terre.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.440]   You've got Genoa, you've got Portofino,
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.600]   these really iconic and incredible places,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.320]   but they're very, very, very touristy.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.040]   And so for me, instead of eating in Portofino
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.880]   and spending 15 euro for a panino
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.160]   that I could get three euro elsewhere,
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.180]   I'd rather go elsewhere and explore
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.000]   and see what else I could find and eat.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.640]   So a great example is a town right next to Portofino
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.200]   called Rapallo.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.000]   I actually have lived in Rapallo on and off
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.880]   a couple of times during the summers,
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.500]   because every time we have a child,
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.000]   we decide that we're gonna go to Rapallo
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.680]   and spend our parental leave there.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.920]   It's just an incredibly magnetic place.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.800]   But Rapallo is a town with kind of nothing to do,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.320]   but everywhere to go easily from.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.000]   And the eating there is exceptional.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.520]   There's a little prosciutto place right on the harbor
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.440]   called Parla Come Mangi, Speak Like You Eat,
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.540]   that's the name of it.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.960]   And they highlight local prosciutto and salami
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.400]   and cheese makers from around the region
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.620]   and from actually around Northern Italy.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:04.720]   And that's all they sell,
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.360]   is prosciutto, cheese, salumi, and some sauces.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.480]   It's like this amazing delicatessen experience.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.120]   Again, you don't need to speak English going in there.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.220]   You don't even know what you want.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.860]   You just kind of go in and say, hey, I like this,
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.960]   and they'll guide you through the whole experience.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.920]   So you could go spend 15 euro for a panino
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.480]   made in Portofino, that's just fine.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.840]   Or you can go spend 15 euro
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.560]   and get three different tastes of things
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.720]   from Parla Come Mangi, and life is good.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.040]   You'll see it in Gambarorosso.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.640]   You'll see it on maybe some food blogs
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.280]   'cause it's now gained popularity.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.400]   But that's an incredible spot.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.440]   And the same idea, by the way,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.360]   when I lived in Rapallo,
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.320]   we'd go down to the Cinque Terre for the day.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.680]   We'd go see the five towns,
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.360]   but we didn't have to be there,
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.200]   we were just immersed in them
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.620]   and all of the tourists sort of onslaught that was there.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.420]   And that to me was a great way of seeing
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.580]   and experiencing the culture,
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.820]   but not having to like be enveloped in it.
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.580]   We could choose we wanted to see the tourist experience,
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.580]   but we could also live like Italian local.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.380]   So my recommendation is if you're going to some places
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.100]   like Como, Cinque Terre, really popular tourist sites,
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.340]   maybe even Venice, take a look at the nearby areas
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.060]   and say, does it make better sense for me
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.940]   to stay in those nearby areas?
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.520]   And then maybe pop in to the tourist spot for a day or two,
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.240]   as opposed to basing myself in the tourist bubble,
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.800]   only experiencing that.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.960]   - And where are you staying
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.360]   when you're leaving a city center?
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.400]   I know in a lot of countries,
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.320]   it's like, there's not a hotel there.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.920]   Are you booking Airbnbs?
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.240]   Is there a different site in Italy
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   that it's for finding houses or apartments?
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.080]   - Great question.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.120]   So Italy has all ranges of accommodation.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.240]   The most expensive hotel in Northern Italy
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.080]   outside of Venice is actually in Portofino.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.100]   It's the Belmond there.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.780]   And it's an incredible property.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.980]   Right outside of Portofino, you have Santa Margherita,
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.860]   you have got Rapallo, you've got other towns.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.700]   And in those towns, there are four and five star hotels
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.340]   that are not the Belmond, but they're lovely.
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.220]   And they're a third or a quarter of the price.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.820]   For an interestingly similar level of luxury,
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.960]   not the same, but close.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.780]   You of course can go much down market from there,
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.660]   and you can find lots of wonderful things.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.420]   The Italians are huge on camping.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.180]   They love camping in the summer.
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.080]   So there's actually campsites within towns
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.620]   that have like motorhome or camper van style campers
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.920]   that you can rent sometimes.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.560]   And that's a really fun way of getting local and immersed.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.840]   Airbnb is huge there.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.240]   VRBO more in the outskirts when you're getting into villas
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.840]   and homes outside of town.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.840]   So you can definitely do that.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.720]   But honestly, what I like to do is look around
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.800]   on booking.com, hotels.com,
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.760]   get a feel for some of the hotels
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.560]   that are selling through those channels
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.920]   that I may not recognize internationally.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.260]   And then I go right to their websites
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.900]   and I find what are their specials, what are their deals.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.740]   I reach out to them through their contact form
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.820]   or through their booking form and say,
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.460]   "Hey, this is when we're coming.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.380]   "We don't need this.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.280]   "We don't need a breakfast.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.220]   "We don't need a suite.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.180]   "Barely gonna be in the room.
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.420]   "Like, what do you got?"
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.580]   And they'll absolutely do a deal with it.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.620]   The best part about some of these Italian hotels too
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.860]   is that they won't take a deposit.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.380]   They'll just take your credit card.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.420]   And when you get there, you pay.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.660]   So some of them have very flexible cancellation policies
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.460]   as well if you go that route.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.180]   Or if you prepay and you make it non-refundable,
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.580]   you can even get a better deal sometime.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.440]   - And what about the kind of typical chain hotels?
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.420]   Are they worth considering?
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.400]   Are there Hyatt's, Marriott's, Hilton's kind of thing?
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.200]   - All over the place, all over the map, yeah.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.440]   Actually, the funniest thing I think
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.120]   is that the best Western brand here in North America,
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.940]   not exactly the nicest hotels.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.800]   If you go to Italy,
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.780]   they're actually not that bad in some places.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.860]   And surprisingly, the best Westerns
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.440]   in off the beaten path cities are actually okay.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.560]   And now granted, not my preference always,
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.860]   but it's a good economical way of staying
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.640]   when maybe the competition nearby
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.200]   is another 100 euro more.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.280]   But yes, if you've got Hyatt points or Marriott points
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.160]   and you want to use them in the big cities,
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.520]   there's definitely opportunities to do so.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.680]   In Italy in particular,
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.960]   you should look out for small luxury hotels
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.760]   that are often part of the Hyatt,
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.560]   sort of world of Hyatt program.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.000]   Those oftentimes will allow for outsized value
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   where you can use your Hyatt points
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.260]   to save on these boutique hotels
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.240]   that would otherwise be very, very expensive.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.200]   Personally for me, when I'm in big cities,
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.460]   Italy has some of the most incredible hotels
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.440]   that are not parts of big brands.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.660]   So it's really fun to experience some of those hotels.
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.620]   There's one in particular,
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.880]   it is part of the Role Chateau marketing partnership,
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.720]   but in Rome, it's called Palazzo Manfredi
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.500]   and it is at the Colosseum.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.540]   And when I say at the Colosseum,
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.660]   I mean, there are suites
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.820]   that if you open up your sliding door,
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.580]   the Colosseum is in front of you.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.100]   There's an unobstructed view,
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.200]   nothing between you and the Colosseum.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.040]   That's incredible.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.580]   Where else in the world do you get that?
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.140]   And so sure, you could stay at the St. Regis,
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.540]   which is an incredible property in Rome, beautiful,
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.740]   but you can also stay at the Colosseum.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.980]   So to me, it's like when you're in Rome,
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.300]   when in Rome, when you're in Italy,
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.900]   you should, you know, Il San Pietro on the Amalfi Coast,
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:54.020]   that family that's been running that hotel for 40 years now,
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.780]   they've built by hand every single room into rock
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.740]   on the side of a cliff overlooking Positano.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.340]   There's nothing like that in the world.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.180]   - Which hotel is this?
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:08.300]   - Il San Pietro, and they are incredible hoteliers.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.140]   They've mastered the art of luxury hotel.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.060]   Food is remarkable.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.100]   It's got a Michelin star and it's in Gamberolo.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.020]   So it's just an incredible experience,
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.420]   but you know, you could choose to stay
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:22.220]   at like a whatever hotel nearby,
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.220]   or you could stay in this icon,
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.940]   this place that is truly incredible.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.740]   There's nothing like it in the world.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:31.540]   So when I look at the big bucket list trip to Italy,
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.300]   I look at staying in some places like that,
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.540]   if they're available, if they're affordable,
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.260]   if not, absolutely use your points at the St. Regis.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.780]   It's an incredible place.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.020]   - But it sounds like if you're gonna take
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.620]   three or four trips and you've got points
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.900]   for not all of them, maybe Italy's one
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.700]   where you're not gonna use your points
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.100]   for hotels or lodging.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:48.940]   - That's correct.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.660]   And I would prepare to find then the boutiques,
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.540]   the other cool places, the three, four, five star hotels,
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.660]   the B&Bs, honestly, that are a good fit
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.660]   for what you want in that city.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.780]   And don't be afraid to look around
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.620]   and comparison shop all over the place
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.300]   and then reach out directly to the hotelier
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.020]   and say, "Hey, these are my dates, what can we do?"
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.020]   - What about when you're in the city
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.580]   and you wanna do things, do you need to set up tours?
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.500]   Do you need to set up guides?
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.820]   Do you get lost on your own?
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.780]   How do you find them?
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.860]   What about booking activities, booking thing?
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.580]   - Yeah, all of the above.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.340]   So look, there are some bucket list things
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.620]   that you're gonna wanna see in Rome, right?
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.100]   You're gonna wanna go to the Vatican.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.620]   You're gonna wanna maybe go to the Coliseum
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.460]   if you're into that.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.060]   And so you're gonna wanna pre-book those as much as you can.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.380]   Vatican in particular, the thing I like to do
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.380]   is the Vatican Museum sells this on their website.
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.900]   So you don't need to buy a special tour for it,
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.620]   but Breakfast at the Vatican, it's called.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.900]   You actually go to the Sistine Chapel pre-opening
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.860]   and you're part of a very small group of people
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.260]   that can do that.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.500]   And then you will have breakfast after the fact
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.580]   at the Vatican in their cafeteria.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.380]   That's an incredible way of seeing
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.180]   one of the most amazing sites in all of the world.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.740]   It's usually very crowded throughout the day.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.820]   So getting in a little early
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.620]   is worth the extra dollars or euros.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.380]   Now, if you wanted to completely privatize
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.100]   that experience too, find other people, we can do that.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:08.060]   But that's a lot more money and a lot more consideration
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.940]   than just buying a ticket online.
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.020]   But the dates you know you're gonna be in Rome,
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.300]   especially those dates that maybe
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.940]   like you've just arrived the day before
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.780]   and you know you're gonna be all jet lagged the day later,
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.340]   like buy the early morning tickets.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.340]   Make sure that you get in to have that experience
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.780]   as privately as you can.
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.860]   But do leave space for spontaneity and what you might find.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.020]   And do feel free to sort of throw your afternoon plans away
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.140]   'cause you're just into the vibe of this cafe or this piazza
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.020]   and you just wanna sit there and watch for a little bit.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.180]   So I like to have structured and semi unstructured time
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.780]   in all the itineraries I put together.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.500]   Now, on a city by city basis, there's so much to do.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.180]   I definitely recommend looking around
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.980]   on various guide websites to see who can do what
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.300]   according to what style of tour or experience you want.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.780]   You know, there's a Jewish ghetto in Rome
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.980]   and there's a great historical food tour
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.300]   that we often combo.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.260]   And that again leads into then sitting at a cafe
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.740]   or at someone's restaurant and (speaking in foreign language)
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.380]   chatting a little bit for the next three hours
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.220]   after that tour.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.980]   Or we do a sidecar tour of a couple of these different cities
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.180]   where you actually hop in a motorcycle sidecar
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.020]   and drive around and get to see the historical sites.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.420]   And you never know where you might end up
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.460]   or where you might stop on that tour.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.860]   So some of those kinds of fun experiences,
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.380]   pre-planned with flexibility in the end,
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.660]   works really, really well.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.060]   - And if you don't have plans,
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.500]   I always like taking free walking tours.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.140]   I feel like they're always led by young, excited people
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.620]   who wanna show off their town.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.820]   They're working for tips.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.540]   So that's something you can do in any city I imagine.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.020]   I've found them almost everywhere.
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.460]   So I've said that a lot,
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.860]   but I think it's a great thing to do
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.980]   if you don't have anything planned
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.380]   and you decide you wanna do something
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.700]   and you haven't booked it in advance.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.540]   - Absolutely.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.860]   And I would say like, take inspiration from websites
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.180]   that actually have lists of tours that they offer.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.940]   Whether you use those tours or not yourself,
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.060]   take inspiration, understand what they're showing you
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.540]   because that's clearly a good guide
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.180]   for what you should see in that town.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.940]   And so what I like to do is go look at Context Travel.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.020]   They're great tours.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.900]   We do a lot of them, a lot of work with them.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.620]   Or even like Airbnb Experiences.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.100]   And just see what people are offering in that area
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.260]   so you know what you should focus on
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.740]   or not focus on while you're there.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.300]   But don't feel like you need to buy
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.060]   the expensive private tour all of the places.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.940]   You know, in the height of summer in Rome,
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.140]   in Florence, in Venice, in Milan,
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.580]   it's gonna be busy and there's gonna be
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.740]   a lot of people there.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.340]   So maybe you do wanna take a private tour somewhere.
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.420]   But outside of those times or those places,
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.500]   maybe you can be okay dealing with some crowds.
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.180]   The exceptions to those rules are places
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.900]   that have timed entry tickets.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.460]   The Accademia in Florence where you see the David
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.980]   or the Uffizi where you see Botticelli's work
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.460]   in a lot of the Renaissance paintings.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.140]   Or in Milan when you wanna go see The Last Supper.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.700]   Those things are very time controlled.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.900]   You need to have a ticket.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.740]   And you'll see as you research your tours,
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.780]   it'll say, hey, this includes a timed entry to blank.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.620]   But what I would say is some of the best parts of Italy
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.020]   are just getting lost and wandering on your own.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.820]   And maybe you don't know what's in front of you,
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.260]   but that's okay, it's beautiful nonetheless.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.900]   And you're there, and so just be there and enjoy it.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.100]   - I know we hit a lot of places,
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.220]   but I'm curious if there are any that we left off
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.180]   that you wanna talk about.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.860]   - So I think it's important as we record this,
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:18.340]   it's 2023 and the White Lotus is like the thing
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.620]   in the media right now.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.540]   And it's their season two, which was filmed in Sicily.
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.180]   And it was filmed at the Four Seasons in Taormina
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.340]   at the San Domenico Palace.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.260]   It's beautiful, stunning property
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.020]   that they put a bunch of money into,
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.220]   redeveloped and it's gorgeous.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.460]   And it's amazing to see the impact of that show
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.460]   and what has happened to travel desire around Sicily.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.820]   Sicily is always a constant for North Americans.
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.100]   We wanna go there.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.900]   A lot of people with Italian roots came from Sicily
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.660]   or had family in Sicily.
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.100]   And so people wanna go see their genealogy
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.460]   and they wanna go see the sights and sounds of Sicily.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.300]   So it's always busy,
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.380]   but this year it's exceptionally busy.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.620]   So I would say, A, book now, there's a lot of interest,
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.300]   but B, know that Sicily is a place
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.500]   where you could easily spend two weeks
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.820]   and not see a fraction of it.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.500]   The area around Taormina,
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.260]   which is where they filmed White Lotus is incredible.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.420]   You've got the Etna volcano,
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.980]   you've got Catania, Ragusa, Siracusa,
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.820]   all these amazing towns that are on the east side of Sicily,
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.180]   full of history and culture and art and food and food
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.180]   and food and food.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.580]   So you could just spend two weeks there,
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.460]   bouncing around from town to town with your own car
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.140]   and you'd be happier than you know what to do with.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.140]   But I would also recommend
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.460]   heading a little further west in Sicily.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.580]   The town of Agrigento has some of the best Greek temples,
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.060]   better preserved in fact,
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.660]   than some of those you'd find in Greece.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.380]   And then there's Palermo, which is incredible.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.900]   Right north of Sicily, you've got the Aeolian Islands.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.300]   The word volcano comes from an island
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.340]   in that little island chain
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.180]   because there's a giant volcano on it.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.700]   It's called Volcano.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.380]   So I'd go there or Stromboli
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.060]   or some of these amazing places in the summer
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.940]   that have lava and mud baths and beautiful beaches
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.380]   and it's just you and the volcano.
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:00.460]   So Sicily is incredibly in demand.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.500]   Puglia on the heel of Italy,
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.620]   another place incredibly in demand.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.820]   Hotels, especially luxury hotels,
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.700]   are popping up left and right down there.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.740]   And if you like the orecchiette pasta,
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.580]   the kind of ear shaped pasta, that's its home.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.660]   If you like sausage and peppers, that's their home.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.340]   If you like beautiful white sand beaches
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.140]   with no one on them for a kilometer, that's your home.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.860]   And it's an incredible place where you can go and explore,
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:29.300]   spend a week, 10 days, not see the same thing twice
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.460]   and eat the best meals of your life.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.260]   And it's not as expensive as Tuscany or Umbria
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.620]   or elsewhere in the north.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.660]   So in the south, those are my winners.
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:42.180]   Sicily, Puglia, and they make for great vacations.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.460]   Do keep in mind if you go in the very heart of summer
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.500]   in July and August, it's hot.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.860]   Tuck in could be easily over 100 degrees Fahrenheit each day.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.140]   That's pretty toasty down there, but it's beautiful.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.940]   And the sea is warm and refreshing.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.980]   Another area that I would also recommend
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.780]   as a side trip from the Amalfi Coast,
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.340]   everyone always goes to Capri.
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.740]   The island of Capri is incredible and beautiful
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.980]   and it's stunning.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.420]   It's a sight to see, but it's also very expensive
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.820]   and it's very crowded.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.860]   And you get the sense when you're there
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.180]   that there aren't really any caprese.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.620]   That's people who live in Capri.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.940]   You don't find the locals.
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.860]   You find people serving tourists.
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.180]   So my recommendation would be go to a neighboring island
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:30.500]   right across the Gulf called Ischia, I-S-C-H-I-A.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.820]   There you'll find true Italians.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.780]   It's a place that is volcanic in origin.
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.940]   So you have mud baths and hot springs
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.980]   and crazy stuff all over the place.
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:44.620]   You have people who are so happy and so proud
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.780]   to show you their island 'cause it's less touristed.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.580]   And you have the ability to get around in,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.540]   whether it's a rental car or a Vespa,
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.660]   or actually they drive these little things called apes,
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.180]   little, called bees.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.500]   They're a little like farm equipment,
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.260]   like a lawnmower with a couple of seats,
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.900]   but they're stylish and they drive you around
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.540]   the island in those.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.180]   And you can really get to know the culture
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.700]   and the people and the restaurants that way.
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.140]   And at a third of the price of Capri.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.340]   - So I think we hit everything.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.500]   Anything in the North, we moving up the coast, any?
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.740]   Let's talk about the North.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.420]   - In the North, you have Venice.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.260]   And the Venice is an incredible place
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.980]   to go for a night or two.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.500]   If you're gonna stay in Venice
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:22.700]   and you've never been before,
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.540]   I absolutely recommend you stay overnight,
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.940]   at least one night, probably no more than two.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.620]   The reason is that there's a lot of day trippers
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.860]   that come in and out of Venice.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.940]   And you'll want to see the city at night
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.340]   when most of the tourists leave.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.900]   It's a magical place.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.060]   But if you've been to Venice before
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.220]   and you haven't been to the area around Venice,
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.260]   and that could be anywhere from Trieste,
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.380]   which is all the way to the East, close to Slovenia,
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:44.780]   or even the Dolomites,
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.780]   about an hour or two North of Venice,
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.660]   then you need to go back to that eight region
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.260]   and go see those places.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.260]   The true heart for me of the Veneto,
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.900]   which is the area around Venice,
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.820]   is not necessarily in Venice proper,
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:58.820]   but it's the area around it.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:02.060]   It's the rich farmland, the Palladian villas,
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.500]   the beautiful mountains and the other cities,
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.220]   especially canal cities that make that area so rich.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.220]   So I would say, make sure you see Venice.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.100]   It's incredible.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.420]   St. Mark's Square, nothing like it in the world.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.780]   And then get out of town, go see something nearby.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.820]   - I feel like we hit a lot.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.220]   I think someone listening to this
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.300]   maybe has some inspiration for their next trip.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.420]   - Or they're totally overwhelmed.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.580]   - Or they're totally overwhelmed.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:25.660]   Maybe listen to it twice.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.940]   You mentioned a few places that you love.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.220]   Are there any other things that when you think of,
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.360]   if you were going on a tour through a lot of these places
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.900]   that are like, you gotta eat here,
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.420]   you gotta have a drink here, you gotta have a coffee here,
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.020]   are there anything like standouts
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.700]   that maybe aren't the obvious ones
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.020]   that someone searching blogs are gonna find?
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:42.860]   - For sure.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.180]   As a general rule, as I said earlier,
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.580]   I love looking at Gamberoro.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.860]   So I love looking at the Michelin Guide.
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.260]   I love to understand what,
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.680]   it doesn't need to be three or even two starred.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.260]   What's Bib Gourmand?
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.220]   What is a good place to go check out
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.940]   that's local and legit?
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.760]   And I start there.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.860]   And then I look at actually TripAdvisor in Italian reviews.
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.420]   Again, if you don't speak Italian,
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:06.540]   take the TripAdvisor reviews in Italy from Italian people
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.180]   and Google translate them into English.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.140]   You'll get a real sense of what something is
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.480]   from an Italian's perspective
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.380]   that's different from a non-Italian.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.220]   Let's put it that way.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.820]   So I like to read some of those
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.740]   to really understand what's great.
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.540]   And then I go back 20, 30 years and see
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:24.200]   what's still standing in a spot for so long
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.740]   that I need to go to.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.780]   I mentioned earlier that I used to live in Rapallo.
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.500]   There's a coffee shop in Rapallo
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.640]   that's been around since the '70s
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:36.160]   that they sell a particular style of biscuit in the morning.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.460]   I'm not a biscuit eater,
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.700]   but this biscuit with their coffee is like amazing.
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.660]   It's called Canepa, C-A-N-E-P-A.
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:47.100]   And so it's not like I need to go to Italy to have that,
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.020]   but when I'm there or nearby,
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.540]   that's the only thing I eat for the week
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.140]   or whatever it is of time that I'm in Italy.
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:56.180]   In Rome, there's a place called Panela, P-A-N-E-L-L-A.
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.760]   They make out of an old school coffee machine,
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.720]   kind of looks like a samovar almost.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.340]   They pull espresso and then they whip it
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.900]   with a zabaglione, egg yolks and sugar.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.820]   And they make this cream.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.500]   And so you can go get an espresso
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:15.460]   with espresso zabaglione cream on top that is to die for.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.460]   And I could literally, Chris,
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.600]   tell you 150 of these things, okay?
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.140]   But the point is is that none of these
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:22.560]   are like undiscovered gems that no one's ever heard of.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.820]   They've been around for 30 years, 50 years, 100 years,
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.140]   doing their thing, selling their one item
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.280]   that makes them spectacular.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.220]   And so every town you go to will have this,
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.440]   from big or small.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.320]   And it's just a question of you seeking them out
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.540]   and finding your own that's exciting to you.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:38.620]   You may not like coffee,
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.080]   and so those two examples I gave you are terrible, right?
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.160]   That's fine.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.060]   But you'll find the thing that makes the Italians,
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.340]   the locals, super proud and makes everybody write about it
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:49.780]   and talk about it and eat it and drink it
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.260]   and experience it themselves.
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.520]   - And if you're someone like me
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.100]   and you're a bit of an over-optimizer
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.620]   trying to find the perfect place,
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:58.020]   is Italy the kind of place that you can fall into a trap
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.260]   of just walking down the street and picking the wrong place?
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.100]   Or is it just like,
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.220]   just go pick any place that looks crowded
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.400]   with people that look like they're speaking Italian
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.520]   and you're gonna have a great meal?
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.920]   - The latter, for sure.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.180]   If you find where the Italians are,
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.320]   you're gonna have a blast.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.360]   If you find a menu in seven languages,
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.200]   beware, have your hackles up,
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.380]   but know that if you're gonna follow the Italians
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:20.000]   and get lost and be off the beaten path,
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.280]   and it might be a little uncomfortable
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.560]   'cause you may not speak Italian
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.720]   and you may not know where you're going.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.380]   Trust your instincts, trust your nose,
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.440]   you're gonna find something great.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.880]   - And you can get back with Google Maps.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.360]   Like, you're not lost.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.200]   - You could tell people,
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.560]   "Hey, I don't know where I'm going, can you help me?"
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.400]   And they will help you.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.640]   They're not gonna take advantage of you.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.900]   They're not brutal people.
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.280]   They're lovely, wonderful people.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.380]   If you start it by saying,
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.920]   "Oh, I'm so happy that I got lost here.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.760]   How do I get back?"
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.600]   (laughs)
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.520]   They'll help you right out.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.280]   - 'Twas the season of Audi,
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.000]   and all along the roads,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.800]   drivers were driving all the way home.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.720]   After long journeys, all arrived on the scene,
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.680]   greeting friends and family and in need of caffeine.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.520]   Laugh off the worries and frigid cold air.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.760]   The best part of the holidays is simply being there.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.920]   How we get there matters,
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.120]   but being there matters more.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.540]   Celebrate the season of Audi.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:16.760]   - Our next partner has a product I literally use every day.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.280]   I started taking AG1 from Athletic Greens
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.760]   because I wanted an easy way
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.720]   to get my daily nutritional insurance
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.640]   and optimize my immune system,
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.160]   and it's been in my routine for almost a year.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.480]   Because when you take one scoop of AG1,
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.640]   you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals,
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.280]   whole food source superfoods,
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.640]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.120]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.280]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.340]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.860]   and energized for the day,
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.360]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.120]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.840]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.600]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.680]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.560]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.040]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.400]   All you have to do is visit

[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.560]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens

[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.880]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,

[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.000]   Any parting thoughts?
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.680]   We didn't go too deep into specific things,
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.960]   but I feel like you left people
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.720]   with a few ideas of what to try.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.800]   Any other standouts?
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.160]   We'll talk a little bit about Airlift,
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.400]   getting to and from Italy,
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.880]   because there's a couple of gems here you wanna know about
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.920]   and a few you can avoid, right?
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.280]   So Alitalia, which is actually an acronym,
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.200]   it's now a dead airline.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.760]   It's the old state airline that Italy used to have.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:06.320]   It died in 2019, 2020, but it was A-L-I-T-A-L-I-A.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.840]   Alitalia, it literally means to Italy
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.480]   or the wings of Italy, depending on how you translate it.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.020]   But it was the acronym for always late in,
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.960]   take off and late in arrival, which is not nice.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.840]   They're dead now,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.640]   and their resurrection is called ITA Airlines.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.880]   It's the same thing.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.920]   I would sort of avoid them if I could.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.600]   They're just meh at best.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.880]   The business class is fine, but economy's pretty terrible.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.640]   But all of your US carriers,
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.120]   your Delta, United, American, et cetera,
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.280]   they all fly nonstop from Gateway Hubs
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.440]   to Rome and some to Milan.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.120]   But the best experience getting to Milan
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.960]   is gonna be on Emirates.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.440]   Now, Emirates flies from JFK to Milan,
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.520]   and then that same aircraft continues on to Dubai,
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.760]   and then it goes back.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.360]   So I would recommend if you can get on business class
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.620]   or ideally first on that flight, do so.
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:56.400]   Emirates just recently made changes to award redemption
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.960]   for that particular route, which is a bummer.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.180]   But sometimes on Emirates partners like Alaska and others,
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.200]   you can still find it.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.600]   So take a look at that.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.000]   As a general rule of thumb,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.440]   I would actually prefer to fly through Paris
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.560]   if you're gonna fly on Air France La Premiere.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.200]   If you're flying in true luxury,
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.900]   then take a nonstop from North America to Italy.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.200]   Just that extra stop,
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.520]   even though it adds another hour or two,
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.020]   it's such a nicer experience than flying United Polaris.
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:23.880]   But there is gonna be a new United Polaris flight
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.280]   from San Francisco to Rome nonstop coming up starting in May,
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.240]   and that'll definitely help with lift from the West Coast.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.440]   In terms of getting around inside of Italy,
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.040]   none of the airlines that fly intra-Italy are great,
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.640]   so don't splurge for business.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.320]   Business class in intra-Italy
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.360]   is literally just an empty economy seat.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.400]   It's blocked off.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.760]   So it's not necessarily something I would say
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.620]   is worth two or three times the price.
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:49.600]   - Which by the way, seems to be this case
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.060]   with almost every European airline.
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.940]   If you're booking an international flight
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:55.220]   using points in business
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.300]   and you get the intra-Europe flight in business for free,
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.140]   why not?
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.620]   But you will be wildly underwhelmed
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.040]   if you've never had that experience
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.020]   because it's literally just a blocked seat in between you.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:05.860]   - Exactly.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.720]   - And in fact, if you're traveling with someone,
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.420]   depending on the airline,
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.580]   sometime that seat is actually blocked.
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:14.180]   Like you can't actually lift up the armrests.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.020]   - There's a thing there.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.660]   - Yeah, so if you actually wanna sit next
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.060]   to whoever you're traveling with,
[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:19.660]   you actually can't in those seats.
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:21.660]   So I totally agree there.
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.540]   Any other points, miles tricks?
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.540]   Normally I would do a location episode
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.620]   and do it separately
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:29.860]   because most of the people I talk to about countries
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.740]   aren't as dialed in on points and miles,
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:32.860]   whereas you might be.
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.840]   Anything there?
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.460]   - Yeah, so I mean, definitely on the hotel side,
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.060]   take a look at using Hyatt points
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:41.060]   for properties in big cities,
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.620]   especially through the SLH properties.
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.140]   Take a look at using Hilton points.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.220]   There's a few higher end Hiltons
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:48.420]   that are sometimes not that egregious.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.440]   Usually they're pretty bad.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.340]   And then there are a handful of Marriott properties,
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:53.940]   especially those on Sardinia,
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.540]   that are usually exceptionally expensive
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.540]   that sometimes allow point redemptions.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.180]   So usually it's shoulder season,
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.820]   like end of May or early September.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.060]   But if you can get one of those Sardinian properties,
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.060]   it's normally 2,000 euro a night
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.260]   and it's 60,000 Marriott points.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.460]   Jump on that twice and then some.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.020]   On the airline side,
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.180]   I do like to fly through Northern Continental Europe.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.900]   Germany, Switzerland, France,
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.740]   even sometimes the UK when doing points redemptions
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:25.540]   because I find that the value of the ticket
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.180]   that I'm usually redeeming for
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.480]   would be greater than the price that I would pay
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.660]   for either a nonstop flight from the States.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:32.940]   I can get a better experience,
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.460]   better bang for my buck out of doing that.
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:36.300]   - Cool.
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.640]   All right, well Lee,
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.280]   I feel like I'm ready both for lunch, by the way.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.380]   Now I'm both hungry,
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:42.940]   but I'm also excited for a trip to Italy.
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:44.100]   I don't know when it'll happen
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.460]   because two kids traveling,
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:49.520]   we're still recovering from the trip to London and Paris,
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.420]   but I'm excited whenever it happens.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.340]   - Just want to call out, Chris,
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:56.000]   I have done weekend trips with kids to Italy before.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:56.920]   It's not an insane idea.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.300]   You can do it yourselves.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.020]   Choose one city and go and spend three nights.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.620]   - I don't think that sounds as fun as you make it seem.
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:04.460]   - Sounds like you're not in.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.620]   - Your kids are older than ours.
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:08.140]   I don't know if a weekend trip with a seven month old
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:08.980]   is gonna be fun.
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:10.980]   - Yeah, not really too exciting when they're that little.
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:11.820]   - Cool.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:12.640]   Well, thank you for doing this.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.480]   - Thank you.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.300]   - Thanks for the opportunity and (speaks in foreign language)
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.140]   Let's go to Italy.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.900]   - That was so awesome,
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.940]   but Lee and I did not get to spend as much time as I wanted
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.920]   talking about points and miles and tactics to get to Italy,
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.360]   as well as how to use your points to stay there.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.900]   So I'm gonna run through a few things,
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.620]   but I'm also gonna share an amazing service I've been using
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.240]   for finding hotel deals with points.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.180]   So when it comes to flights,
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:40.780]   all the major US carriers, United, American, and Delta
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.220]   fly to Rome from their hubs.
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.020]   There's a few flights from each of them,
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.820]   mostly from more East Coast hubs to Milan,
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.180]   and then just a couple flights to Venice
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:53.680]   from the New York area, Atlanta, and Philly.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.020]   Don't forget that Air Canada also flies
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.180]   from Montreal and Toronto to Rome
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.100]   and from Toronto to Venice.
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.940]   So if you're nearby, that's another good option.
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:05.420]   But there are a couple other airlines
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.620]   that while you can't use points or miles on,
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.100]   I do wanna flag.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.700]   There's Norse Atlantic Airways,
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.880]   which I talked about on the London episode.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.380]   I'll just bring it up because it is so inexpensive
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.140]   to fly from JFK to Rome.
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.180]   When I looked on a date in August,
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.020]   it was $328 on Norse Atlantic
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:27.060]   versus 900 on the cheapest flight on all other airlines.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:28.720]   So huge savings there.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.660]   It's definitely a budget airline,
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.260]   though they are flying Dreamliners, which is nice.
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.860]   So if you're on the East Coast,
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.700]   that could be worth looking into, or if you can get there.
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.300]   There's also an airline called La Compagnie,
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:41.940]   which is, I think is a French airline
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.020]   that flies from Newark to Milan.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:47.300]   It's interesting because it's an all business class airline,
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.420]   but their flights are as low as $3,000 round trip
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:53.060]   in business, which is a lot less than other airlines.
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.300]   Then finally, another airline that we haven't talked about
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.020]   and you might not know is called Nios.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.420]   It's Italy's second largest airline,
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.340]   has really affordable flights to Milan from JFK.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:05.780]   I found them as low as $500 round trip online.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.940]   So that's another one.
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.380]   So obviously if you're using points and miles, though,
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:10.460]   none of those are options,
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.620]   and you're gonna be focusing on airlines
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.100]   that are part of major alliances
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.800]   that you can transfer points to,
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.420]   and that's usually gonna be Delta, American,
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.060]   United, Air Canada from North America,
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.820]   Emirates also, as Lee mentioned,
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:26.460]   that flight from JFK to Milan.
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.720]   And then also if you're willing to change planes,
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.980]   Air France, KLM, Virgin, British Airways, Lufthansa, Swiss,
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.340]   there are a ton of airlines
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.360]   that you can fly to change planes on.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.180]   But I wanna share a little bit high level
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.660]   of some searches I just did
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.620]   to get you a sense of what's possible.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:43.500]   I went on United's site, I looked for the next month,
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.060]   and it seems very, very easy
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:48.020]   to find an economy flight for 30,000 points.
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:49.380]   So that is great.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:52.680]   I imagine if you have points in any transferable program,
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.060]   you could transfer to some airline
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:56.300]   that's part of Star Alliance,
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.920]   whether that's Air Canada, Avianca, or United,
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.940]   and book something really affordable in economy.
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:04.900]   If you're looking for business, I did find some flights.
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:08.300]   I found a flight through Frankfurt in October and in April,
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.980]   and the lowest prices I found were about 70,000 points
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.420]   one way on United.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.300]   However, let me walk through an example
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.060]   of how the way you search for some of these flights
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:21.180]   can make a huge difference in the value you're getting.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.460]   So I just looked for a few weeks from now,
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.920]   April 4th, San Francisco to Rome.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:29.140]   I found a flight on United's website for 81,000 points
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.060]   that changes planes in Frankfurt.
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:33.140]   So I thought, okay, that's not a bad use of points, right?
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:34.980]   80,000 points for a business class flight.
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:37.420]   Yes, there are some dates you could find it for 70,
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.900]   but that's a pretty good deal.
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.060]   However, I went to point.me, I did the same search,
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.380]   and what it'll do is not just look
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.180]   at where there's availability,
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.560]   but it'll look at the cost to book that flight
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.780]   on all the different airlines you could transfer
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.300]   from your credit card programs,
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.620]   and find out things like if you transferred Capital One
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.580]   or Amex points to Avianca,
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.880]   you could actually book that flight for 63,000 points
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.260]   instead of 81,000 on United.
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.900]   Or because there's a 20% bonus right now,
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.860]   you could transfer from Citi to Avianca,
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:10.580]   and you only need 53,000 points.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:14.680]   So for a $3,600 flight, if you only need 53,000 points,
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.740]   that means you're getting 6.8 cents per point.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.700]   And even if you booked with Chase or United,
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:21.220]   and you booked it for 81,000,
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.840]   you're still getting four and a half cents per point.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.980]   And when I looked at the cheapest flight
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.980]   with one stop in economy that day,
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:30.960]   it was almost $1,000.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.620]   So the crazy thing is if you wanted to use
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:37.060]   that 53,000 points in Citi and book in the travel portal,
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.580]   you would only get $530.
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:41.200]   So you couldn't even book a coach flight there.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.580]   And if you took the 80,000 points on Chase,
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:47.060]   if you had a Chase Sapphire preferred,
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.980]   you'd be able to use that 80,000,
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.340]   and you'd be able to book $1,000 ticket.
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.580]   If you happen to have a Chase Sapphire reserve,
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.620]   you'd get one and a half cents in the portal.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:57.940]   So that 81,000 points would get you a little more
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.560]   than $1,200, which would actually cover the economy flight.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.220]   However, we're talking about a business class flight.
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:06.780]   So the reason I love transferring points to airlines
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.700]   is because in circumstances like this,
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.600]   if you find the availability,
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.420]   you can usually get a business class flight
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:16.100]   for not too far off from what you would have gotten
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:18.700]   an economy flight for if you were just redeeming
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:19.540]   in the portal,
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.980]   or you had had a cashback card in the first place.
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.300]   So if we assume that in a given year,
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.220]   you spend $30,000 on your credit card,
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:31.060]   and you manage to optimize such that you're
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:34.540]   on average getting back two points per dollar,
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.260]   or if you had a cashback card 2% back,
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:42.260]   then that $30,000 getting 2% cash back would earn you $600.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:46.000]   But in points, you'd be earning 60,000 points.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.460]   Well, that $600 is definitely not gonna book you
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:49.740]   a business class flight to Italy.
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:53.100]   You would need $1,200 just to book the coach flight,
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:54.820]   but you could actually take those points
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:58.980]   and transfer them from Citi or Cap One or Amex
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.500]   to Avianca and get this flight.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.420]   So I hope that example is helpful.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.620]   I just wanted to share a few other examples I found
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.100]   'cause I know not everyone has points
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.740]   in every single program,
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.900]   but I looked on American and I found a round trip flight
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.420]   for 115,000 points in business.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:18.020]   I even found a nonstop in business for 100,000 points,
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.540]   which is one way, but in July,
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.260]   which is the peak travel season
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.260]   for Americans going to Italy.
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.580]   So that was interesting.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.220]   And then finally, I did a fun search
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.500]   for the Emirates flight,
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.060]   because if you wanna get to JFK and fly JFK to Milan,
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.980]   you get a chance to do it on Emirates.
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.500]   You could do it on a first class cabin if you want
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.580]   with points that has a shower.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.780]   It's really unbeatable.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.400]   Private suites on the plane,
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.580]   it's very hard to find those flights.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.660]   And if you find the right time and the right days,
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.920]   which takes some work,
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.860]   you can get in business or first on Emirates
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.720]   for under 100,000 points.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.180]   Now, is it really worth doing that
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:58.380]   when you could go for 53,000 on, you know,
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:03.380]   Lufthansa or Swiss Air or Air France or another airline?
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.140]   That's really up for you to decide.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.660]   It is a unique experience
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.020]   that you probably won't have on any other airline,
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.940]   but it also means that you could probably go
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.460]   two for the price of one when you compare the cost.
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.000]   So that's up to you to decide.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.460]   But I will say, when you're doing these searches,
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:21.100]   in general, the way I approach it is,
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.980]   there's a bunch of airlines that fly the route I want.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.720]   First, I'll go and search on some of these airline websites
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.520]   because they have an easy calendar.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.060]   You can go to the American website
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.740]   and see a month at a time.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.600]   Unfortunately, you can only see from one destination,
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.520]   so you can search from your destination.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.860]   But sometimes what unfortunately happens
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.880]   is that American, for example,
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.240]   might not have award flights from San Francisco to Dallas,
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.120]   but they might have Dallas nonstop to Italy.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.080]   And so you might be willing to spend a couple hundred dollars
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.540]   to fly to Dallas if the flight from Dallas
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.640]   all the way to Italy is free and in business class.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.560]   So you do have to do a bit of searching
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.680]   from some of the different hubs where airlines fly from,
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.840]   but most of those airline websites,
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.120]   one of the advantages is you get a calendar for the month.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.620]   So on United, you get this.
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.120]   On American, you get this.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.280]   A lot of different airlines have this option.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.960]   So you can search a wide set of dates
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.100]   and see when the sweet spots are.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.000]   However, I strongly encourage people to consider
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.880]   that once you've found it,
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.760]   don't necessarily book on American,
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.800]   don't necessarily book on United,
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.400]   because there might be a partner airline
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.760]   that's much cheaper to book on,
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.400]   and that's where Point.me comes in and can be so valuable.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.360]   I use it almost every week
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.920]   when I'm helping friends search for flights,
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.920]   when I'm searching for flights for us.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.400]   The only knock I have on it
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.480]   is that there isn't a multi-day search on their website.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.520]   So if your dates aren't flexible,
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.880]   you don't even need to go to the airlines.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.160]   You can say, "I'm looking at this day,"
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.160]   or even if they're flexible within one or two days, great.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.360]   But if you're looking at, "I wanna go somewhere,
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.680]   "and I could go anytime,"
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.920]   Point.me might be tricky
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.560]   because you have to search a day at a time.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.680]   That said, I would argue,
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.280]   if you're willing to go in an off season,
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.680]   pick a time that would be good.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.040]   You could still search there,
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.960]   and you might find something right away,
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.400]   but if you don't, it can be a little bit burdensome.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.560]   But I did wanna point two things out on Point.me.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.120]   First, as I've said in the past,
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.720]   if you wanna get your first month for $1,
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.240]   you can sign up for the monthly standard plan.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.480]   And just to be clear, 'cause it's a little confusing,
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.560]   don't go to the, "I have a code" field.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.040]   Sign up for the standard plan with monthly billing
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.560]   that's $12 a month, and all the way at checkout,
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.000]   if you put all the hacks,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.040]   you'll get your first month for $1.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.600]   However, for the month of March,
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.900]   if you do go to the services page,
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.120]   there is a field that says, "I have a code,"
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.020]   and there's a complimentary starter pass,
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.360]   which gives you access for 24 hours,
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.500]   which normally costs $5.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.920]   If you use all the hacks there just in the month of March,
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.960]   50 people can get that access.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.040]   A lot of people are listening to this show.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.960]   I can't promise it'll still be available when you try,
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.500]   but the $1 for your first month should.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.340]   So definitely consider checking it out.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.480]   I am happy paying customer at Point.me.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.160]   I think it's a really great product.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.520]   I've heard so many people have had a great experience.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.520]   And if all of this is too complicated,
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.320]   they do also have a consulting service
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.800]   where they will just, for $200 a passenger,
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.680]   book your entire flight for you with their concierge.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.760]   So that's definitely something to consider.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.480]   If you don't wanna deal with this,
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.900]   if we go back to our business class example,
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.000]   if your alternative is,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   "I'm not going to use my points optimally
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   "because it's too much work
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.800]   "and I don't wanna try to do this."
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.040]   Well, in that example,
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:34.320]   if 53,000 points is able to get you a $3,600 flight,
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.340]   it would absolutely have been worth you paying
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:40.000]   an additional $200 for a concierge to go look into this
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.320]   and figure out a way to make it work.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.800]   And by the way, if they don't find anything,
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.840]   they only require a $25 search fee to get started.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.720]   So it's a pretty low risk option
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.920]   for people who aren't willing to spend the time
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.800]   to go do some of the searching their own,
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.640]   but still wanna get those really, really outsized values
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.160]   from their points.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.160]   So that's flights, but let's talk about hotels
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.080]   because there's so many great options in Italy.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.560]   But before that, I wanna talk about Aways,
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.580]   which is a really awesome service I started using.
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:11.080]   And it's basically become my de facto way
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.880]   I search for hotels with points these days.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.920]   And what I love about it
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.520]   is they show you the cash price
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.280]   right next to the award price.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.240]   But even more than that,
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.380]   they show you the award availability.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.200]   So they make it so easy to find
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.240]   which hotels have availability,
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.160]   and you can look at a calendar view
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.480]   of when they're available,
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.440]   and you can compare the cash and the award price
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.720]   to see if it's a good deal.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.600]   It works for Hilton, Marriott, IHG, and Hyatt,
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.680]   and they actually let you filter on your balances
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.640]   with those programs or your balances
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.040]   at Chase, Built, and Amex.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.840]   And they'll factor in things like
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.760]   how Marriott and Hilton give you fifth night free
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.720]   and show you the price respective to that.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.520]   Unlike Point.me, they actually have a free option,
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.040]   so you can go in and search for the real-time cash
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.400]   and award pricing and get availability for free.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.920]   And they do this for over 1,000 cities
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.960]   and over 25,000 hotels around the world.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.220]   Unlike Point.me, they do have a free service
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.420]   that gives you access to the cash and award prices
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.160]   and the award availability.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.960]   However, I've been playing with the premium version.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.840]   They give you features like being able to search
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.600]   for your free night certificates,
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.300]   being able to filter on the pricing
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.160]   for getting your fourth or fifth night free
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.980]   depending on the hotel chain.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:23.600]   But the real thing that I love
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:27.560]   is that you can get a wider view of the award pricing.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.960]   So with the gold plan, you can get a seven-day view,
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.780]   and with the platinum plan, you can get a 30-day view.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.840]   But I heard a little rumor that by the end of this week,
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.640]   that'll switch to be a calendar view
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.680]   you can browse for the whole year.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.960]   So if you're eyeing a property,
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.920]   like let's say the St. Regis in Rome
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.000]   and you wanna see when you can get the best deal,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.120]   you'll be able to click through the whole year.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.600]   So like I said, you can use the product for free,
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.040]   but if you want all the features,
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.640]   you can use the gold or the platinum plan,
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.540]   and you can get a five-day free trial.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.780]   So you can actually go in and play around with this
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.720]   right now for free.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.860]   But for all the Hacks listeners,
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:04.040]   I got them to offer $10 off the platinum plan forever,
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.800]   not just your first year, forever.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:09.600]   If you just go to allthehacks.com/aways with a Z,
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.200]   A-W-A-Y-Z.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.240]   I'll also put the link in the show notes.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.680]   Definitely go check it out.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.320]   You can use it for free for five days
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.160]   or even the free version of it forever.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.220]   But I will highlight a few of the hotels that I found
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.320]   when I was doing some searching,
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.840]   just to get you an idea of some amazing
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.840]   outsized value you can get.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.400]   So within Hyatt, and I'll just caveat
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.920]   that if anyone listening isn't familiar,
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.720]   unfortunately on March 28th,
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.480]   Hyatt is gonna change the prices of a lot of their hotels.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.160]   And it's not all of the hotels
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.000]   and not all of them are going up,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.080]   but the award cost for 214 Hyatt hotels and resorts
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.920]   is going to change.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.840]   On average, everything's going up
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.360]   about 5,000 points per night,
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.340]   but some hotels are going down
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:57.360]   and you still have, by the time this comes out,
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.760]   in five or six days to go in and search,
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.040]   which honestly is a perfect opportunity
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.560]   if you have a trip to plan
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.000]   to go use the five day AWAYS free trial
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.720]   to go find out if you can find a way
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.680]   to get a value from your points before it gets devalued.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.760]   I'll put a link in the show notes
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.340]   to all the hotels that are changing categories
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.840]   so you can see if they're in that list.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.160]   Obviously, if the hotels you wanna go to aren't,
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.320]   then there's not a lot of rush to do any booking,
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.280]   but if there's a trip you know you wanna plan
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.520]   and there's a Hyatt hotel you know you wanna stay at
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.920]   that is going up in price,
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.280]   definitely get that booked before the 28th of this month.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.720]   But just as some examples, within Hyatt,
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.480]   the Park Hyatt in Milan looks beautiful.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.800]   When I looked at a few dates,
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.920]   it was about $1,040 a night,
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.080]   but you could book it for 40,000 points,
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.280]   which means you can get 2.6 cents per point,
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.240]   which is amazing.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.680]   Though in Milan, there's also the Hyatt Centric,
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.280]   which costs a lot less at 470,
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.080]   but is only 15,000 points per night,
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.120]   so 3.1 cents per point value, which is really great.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.320]   And then there's a few Hyatt small luxury hotel properties
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.440]   that are part of that little collection they have
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.020]   that you can get for similar values,
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.720]   like the Hotel Dink Hill Terra,
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.640]   which I found for 29,000 points a night,
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.960]   which is really nice.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.120]   On the Marriott side, the St. Regis in Rome and Venice,
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.840]   both look beautiful, both are over $1,200 a night,
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.260]   but I found the one in Rome for 75,000 points a night,
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.440]   which works out to about 1.7 cents per point,
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.000]   which is really big for Marriott,
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.040]   because Marriott points often are kind of more
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.120]   around the 0.7 cents value.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.100]   And then at the St. Regis in Venice,
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.700]   which when I looked was about $1,300 a night,
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.800]   but I found it under 100,000 points,
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.160]   which similarly is kind of double the value
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.120]   in terms of what you get for your Marriott points.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.760]   So there are some really great spots for Marriott,
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.080]   and all that goes down by 20% if you book five nights.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.000]   So don't forget that you get your fifth night free
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.620]   on Marriott, and you also get the same thing on Hilton.
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.160]   And so if you look at Hilton in Rome,
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.000]   there's the Cavaleri Hotel,
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.980]   which is a Waldorf Astoria property.
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.840]   I found it for a few different dates
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.880]   for 80,000 points a night.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.280]   But if you don't have Hilton points,
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.480]   Amex transfers one to two,
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.800]   so you only need 40,000 Amex points.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.000]   So that was a $746 a night property,
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.080]   which means on the Amex point side,
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.680]   you're getting about 1.9 cents per point.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.160]   Or if you book it five nights and get your fifth night free,
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.080]   that bumps up to about 2.4 cents,
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.140]   which is still a much better deal
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:24.580]   than using the portal to get one cent per point with Amex.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.200]   Obviously, like in the example earlier,
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.600]   you can get much more value
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.100]   on some of these international business class flights.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.000]   But honestly, if you're not looking to fly business
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.720]   and you want your points to go further,
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.680]   you might be more interested in flying economy
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.360]   and staying in hotels.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.280]   Or maybe you're just someone
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.680]   who doesn't care about the flight experience,
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.560]   you just like a really nice hotel.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.140]   I totally support that as well.
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.440]   So those are a few of the points options.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.580]   I'm not gonna go through every single hotel
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.000]   and every single property,
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.480]   because when I looked, there were so many.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.040]   Marriott has 63 hotels, Hilton has 33,
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.340]   Hyatt had 52, and it looks like IHG has another 49.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.960]   So that all adds up to probably 200 hotels
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.880]   you could use your points and miles at.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.980]   So hopefully that gives you a little bit of an overview
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:11.100]   of how you might wanna use your points and your miles
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.340]   to get to Italy, to stay in Italy.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:14.620]   Definitely reach out to me.
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.820]   Let me know what you think of the Oaze product.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.780]   I have reached out and talked to John,
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.020]   the CEO of the company,
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:22.800]   and he's definitely open to product feedback as well.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.700]   So feel free to send them an email if you have suggestions.
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.060]   There are a bunch of other updates
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:27.980]   that I've already sent him,
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:30.720]   that some of which he said are coming as soon as this week.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.500]   So I'm really excited to see how that product evolves.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.620]   But most of all, I'm really excited to have another tool
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:37.980]   in the hotel toolkit,
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.520]   because the only site I knew of
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.280]   was a site called AwardMapper,
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.320]   which stopped updating things as hotels changed hands
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.680]   and changed their rates, and it really became unreliable.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.340]   So really excited that we have a couple tools
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.420]   that you guys can use to book your next trip
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.100]   with points and miles and find really great deals.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.460]   So if you wanna check out point.me,
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.220]   don't forget the promo code, AllTheHacks.
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.060]   And if you wanna check out Oaze,
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:04.060]   don't forget to go to allthehacks.com/Oaze, A-W-A-Y-Z.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:08.580]   So I would love to hear if anyone is going to Italy,
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.620]   plans a trip to Italy, uses any of this advice,
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:13.620]   or even has other tips they wanna share,
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.140]   please send them my way.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.580]   This whole country series is going to be a thing.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:20.820]   I'm gonna be doing it probably every four to six weeks.
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.180]   So please let me know what you think.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.220]   Let me know if there are countries
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:24.740]   that are at the top of your list,
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.300]   and we'll see what's next.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.020]   Right now, I'm trying to get Brandon Presser,
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.900]   who I did the Japan episode with,
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.980]   to do one on Iceland, because it turns out
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.220]   he knows just about as much, if not more,
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.540]   about Iceland as he does about Japan,
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:39.140]   which is hard to believe, but really exciting,
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.420]   because Iceland has been at the top of my list
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:44.320]   for a long time, and I've never been able to go.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:47.220]   We even threw out the idea of trying to fly to Iceland
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.800]   and do the episode there, but two little kids
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.420]   is likely gonna make that challenging.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.340]   So thank you so much for listening.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.020]   I hope you enjoyed this episode,
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:56.420]   and I'll see you next week.
