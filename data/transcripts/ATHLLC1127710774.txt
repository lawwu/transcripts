[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.560]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.180]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.020]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.300]   and I love to travel.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.640]   And even more, I love optimizing that travel
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.380]   to have the best experience at the lowest cost.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.820]   And one country that's at the top of my list,
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.340]   and many of yours who've emailed in, is Italy.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.300]   Now, technically I've been to Italy before,
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.260]   but Amy and I did Rome and Venice for two days each
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.240]   back in college almost 20 years ago.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.060]   So at this point, it almost feels like I've never been.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.920]   And I couldn't think of anyone better to join me
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620]   for this episode than my good friend
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.360]   and guest from episode one, Lee Rowan,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.760]   who runs a travel company called Savanti,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.280]   and has been to Italy 40 to 50 times.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760]   So many, he actually lost track of the count.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.880]   We're gonna talk about the places to go,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.800]   the spectacular cuisine, the gorgeous coastlines,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.780]   ancient ruins, and some of Italy's rich history.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.880]   We'll also get to some of Lee's favorite
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.480]   off the beaten path locations
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.800]   for an authentically local experience,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.480]   and hear why he thinks life
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.880]   is just that much better in Italy.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.160]   Finally, we're gonna dive into some of the best ways
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.920]   you can use your points and miles for your trip to Italy,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.680]   including a quick overview of a new site I've been using
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.400]   to help you get the best hotel deals with points.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.480]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.080]   Lee, thank you for being here.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.080]   Round three, you get to take the title
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.480]   as most visited guest.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.360]   You already had it, but now you get it again.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.920]   Thank you for having me here in this new setup you have.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.080]   I'm looking around, it's really quite impressive.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.480]   Beautiful job you've done.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.360]   - Yeah, I took this course, DreamStudioCourse.com
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.320]   that this guy Kevin Chen created,
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.960]   and you'll get a better view
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.560]   if you're watching this on YouTube than listening,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.480]   'cause you can't really see it.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.320]   You'll get an even better view
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.300]   when I start to actually record in a couple days
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.800]   with a virtual thing, because that was what I optimized for.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.860]   But there is now an in-studio option for all the hacks,
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.200]   which we have here.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.040]   - It's very cool, very cool.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.200]   Thank you for inviting me in here
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.880]   to chat about one of my favorite places in the entire world.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.160]   - Yeah, so I am excited because we started with London
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.640]   because I was going on a trip and I wanted to figure it out.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.520]   And then we dove into Japan,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.240]   which actually now that I think about it,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.160]   Brandon Presser made his second appearance.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.540]   And now we're talking to Italy,
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.040]   which I'm really excited about
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.680]   because I was about to go to London.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.520]   I had been to Japan a lot.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.600]   And Italy, I went on the few days
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.440]   after our college whirlwind trip,
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.800]   but it's a trip that we wanna take.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.400]   And it's not gonna happen this year,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.720]   but it's gonna happen in the future.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.000]   And I'm really excited to dive in.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.840]   I don't know a lot, so I'm glad we have the expert here.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.440]   - Yeah, well, I appreciate you inviting me, of course,
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.120]   and giving me this chance to chat about something
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.700]   that is truly one of my favorite places
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.460]   for people, for food, for culture, for beauty, for sights.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.120]   I mean, we could chat for much longer
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.680]   than this podcast will go
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.840]   about everything that's great in Italy.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.640]   So I'm excited to dive into your questions
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.000]   and share some of my own passion.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.020]   - So why do you keep going back?
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.860]   What is it?
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.840]   I mean, you just listed a bunch of things,
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.600]   but what makes Italy such a unique travel place?
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.560]   - Yeah, well, I've been to 70 countries.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.520]   I've been very fortunate to go all seven continents
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.660]   around the world.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.920]   And the thing that makes me feel most at home in Italy
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.200]   is just that the Italians know how to live.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.480]   They know how to live life.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.600]   Great food, great wine, great coffee.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.640]   But more than all of that,
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.240]   it's just this continual enjoyment of life.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.280]   There's the evening passeggiata, where people walk.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.680]   Everywhere you can go, you walk, which is incredible.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.160]   Big cities, small cities, everyone walks.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.180]   But they're out and about,
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.160]   and they're walking from cafe to cafe.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.400]   They're seeing friends, they're being social.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.920]   But no one's in a hurry, no one's in a rush.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.600]   No one's off to catch the next thing.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.000]   They're just there living in the moment, being.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.920]   And if you look at that as a narrative example
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.120]   of how you can live, right?
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.620]   These people have been doing this for thousands of years,
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.000]   3000 years of civilization in Italy,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.200]   where they're just being.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.440]   There's no greater thing to do, or to-do list,
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.480]   or all these things that keep us busy here at home.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.800]   It's just being.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.180]   And that, for me, is so refreshing.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.880]   So I feel like I have to go back and back
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.160]   to get another taste of that every chance I get.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.280]   And of course, the food.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.600]   When I'm there, I'm tasting that too.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.920]   And it's incredible, the diversity and the ability
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.640]   of the Italian cuisine to take these wonderful things
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.760]   from their natural, abundant resources,
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.180]   the sea, the mountains, their fields,
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.320]   and turn them into these masterpieces on the table.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.800]   - Okay, so I think one of the things
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.260]   I'm just gonna preface everyone to consider,
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.960]   which is a lot of times people travel
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.160]   and they say, "I gotta go do this."
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.720]   It sounds like a big attraction in Italy
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.860]   is learning to kind of relax and enjoy what you're doing.
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.520]   So maybe that's a theme that we'll just kind of keep here,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.280]   which is as much as we might talk about
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.600]   lots of cool things to see and don't feel like
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.560]   need to spend every single moment of every single day doing.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.760]   - That is 100%.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.600]   The biggest takeaway I think people can take
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.040]   from this podcast is the discussion of be here now
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.080]   in the moment, the place that you are in Italy,
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.160]   knowing that you're, yeah,
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.740]   you're not gonna see all the rest of it.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.100]   Like I've been to Italy 40 or 50 times.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.960]   I forgot the count.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.160]   And what's crazy is that out of all of the 20 Italian regions
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   that there are, I'm still missing a few of them
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.040]   after having been there 40 times.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.180]   And so I, an Italophile,
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.600]   somebody who loves going to Italy, speaking Italian,
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.400]   eating Italian food, seeing Italian culture,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.640]   I still haven't seen it all.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.720]   And I will never see it all
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.240]   because there's such a diversity in that country.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.200]   60 plus million people, you know,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.000]   it's the fifth most visited country in the world,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   but there is still so much to see
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.040]   that people don't scratch beyond the surface
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.100]   and see when they do their Rome, Florence, Venice trip
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.720]   and they think they've seen Italy.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.300]   You've seen three cities in Italy,
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.960]   come back and see everything, come see a lot more.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.520]   - Well, I think most people listening
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.880]   probably won't in their lifetime make 40 trips to Italy.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.360]   So it sounds wonderful, but let's just talk high level.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.240]   Someone wants to go to Italy
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.800]   and it's impossible to see it all,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.880]   but nobody or most people don't have 10 weeks a year
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.720]   to go spend in Italy,
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.040]   which I'm sure if they did, you would highly recommend,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.240]   but maybe they've got a week or two
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.420]   and they're like, I wanna go see Italy.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.720]   I wanna experience what you're talking about.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.880]   How would you suggest they start to approach it?
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.780]   Or what are a few different approaches?
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.100]   - Yeah, great question.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.860]   So I think the first thing to realize and understand
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.780]   is that no approach is the right approach.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.780]   There are so many different ways of seeing Italy.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.620]   If you look at it as like a matrix, right?
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.020]   All the different cities, all the different sites,
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.660]   all the different reasons for visiting,
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.580]   and you could go just see museums
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.060]   and be busy for 10 days in Rome alone,
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.820]   or you could do the Rome, Venice, Florence tour,
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.400]   Milan tour of all the museums
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.860]   or all the churches and historical sites
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.980]   and still not see all of the highlights
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.680]   that you could see in 10 days.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.780]   So I think knowing that you're going into it,
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.120]   leaving a lot on the table,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.320]   leaving things to come back and visit in the future is great.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.080]   The second idea is knowing that it's really easy
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.660]   to burn out on too much eating, too much museuming,
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.520]   too much churching as you go to Italy.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.160]   And so building a nice mix in an itinerary
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.720]   is a really important thing to do.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.520]   So where do I find inspiration?
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.980]   There's a lot of really great media right now
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.680]   that focuses on an aspect of Italian culture or life.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.860]   You know, Stanley Tucci has been doing
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.180]   for the past two years his sort of Tour d'Italia,
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.600]   and he's going to all 20 regions,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.720]   and he's eating his way through.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.560]   And if you look at the way
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.840]   that he's approached his episodes,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.640]   these hour-long sort of opus,
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.240]   these hour-long bits of love to Lazio, where Rome is,
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.480]   or Campania, where they grow the tomatoes
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.500]   that become your pizza tomatoes here in the States,
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.900]   you look at him really getting to know a people
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.480]   and a culture and a place,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.360]   something that he's very familiar with already,
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.580]   but through the lens of food and culture.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.100]   And that's a wonderful approach for people to take,
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.520]   is they find some angle that they love,
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.880]   whether it's in a book or a TV series,
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.080]   and they say, "Hey, I want to go recreate
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.040]   an element of that on my trip.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.520]   So I want to go to the place
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.160]   where Stanley Tucci finds the tomato
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.140]   in the field of San Marzano and says,
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.960]   "Okay, I found the real tomato.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.320]   Now I know what it's supposed to taste like."
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.080]   That's a centerpiece for their trip.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.720]   But there are so many blogs that are out there.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.480]   There's so many travel advisors willing to help.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.640]   There's so many books you can read
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.740]   about everything to eat, see, and do in Italy.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.020]   My biggest takeaway for people, again,
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.820]   is take your time and know
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.980]   that you're not going to see it all.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.500]   You're not going to do it all.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.020]   And you're going to have an amazing time
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.300]   in the process of whatever you do, see, and do.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.900]   - So I feel like I'm both more excited to go to Italy,
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.780]   and I have no idea what I should do with a week and a trip.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.980]   Maybe give some options.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.220]   I'm thinking one to two weeks,
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.020]   maybe let's throw out two or three things
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.540]   that you might send someone to.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.000]   Is Rome a must include on any first trip to Italy?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.240]   - In my opinion, yes.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.600]   All roads lead to Rome for good reason, right?
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.800]   Look, it's the third most visited city in all of Europe.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.920]   To me, it is a place that is happy and fun
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.840]   and lively and young and still so very old,
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.260]   full of incredible cuisine,
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.460]   full of some of the best historical sites in the world.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.640]   Look, to me, the fact that they could build the Pantheon,
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.320]   this concrete domed roof with an open hole
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.400]   in the oculus in the center, 2,000 years ago,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.920]   and it's still standing.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.120]   It's still standing, it's like mind blowing.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.720]   Like we can't build a road here.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.720]   They can build a, 2,000 years ago,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.420]   a dome that is in the center of town that is remarkable.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.360]   And so when you see that,
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.800]   you have a sense of awe that returns to you,
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.920]   whether you've been there 40 times or this is the first.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.600]   So I think Rome is absolutely an incredible place to go.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.520]   Go see the sites, go see the touristy sites
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.200]   that are overcrowded, the Colosseum, Vatican,
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.000]   because they really are monuments to humanity
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.240]   and to an incredible society that has built
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.720]   and upkept these buildings for 2,000 years.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.400]   But also get lost, go off the beaten path in Rome
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.880]   and don't just go to the fancy gelateria
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.300]   across from the Trevi Fountain.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.900]   It's beautiful, it's great for Instagram,
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.120]   but go wind through the streets of Trastevere,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.060]   across the river where the Romans live
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.360]   and the Romans go eat, and explore that little village
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.640]   and see what it's like to be in a little borgo,
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.560]   a little village inside of a big metropolitan city.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.080]   Have a meal on a piazza where maybe you're the only person
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.320]   who doesn't speak fluent Italian, that's okay.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.520]   You're gonna be welcomed in,
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.360]   you're gonna eat an incredible meal,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.340]   and you're gonna see the way that the sweetness
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.640]   of doing nothing passes by in front of you on passeggiata
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.640]   as people are walking from the cafe to the restaurant
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.760]   to their home and beyond.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.080]   - Okay, so that's Rome.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.740]   So let's say I wanna do Rome and something else.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.720]   What are a few options?
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.800]   - Well, from Rome within, if you draw like a big circle,
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.480]   you say I wanna take a two-hour train ride from Rome,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.880]   you've got a ton of options, north and south.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.720]   Traditionally, people would go south to the Amalfi Coast.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   It's incredible, it's iconic, it's beautiful.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.600]   It's been made famous since the movies in the '50s, right,
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.680]   where you're driving along these mountainside roads
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.160]   and there's a sheer cliff 500 feet down
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.000]   and beautiful beaches and incredible food and wine.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.400]   That's amazing, it really is.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.720]   The downside to it is that everyone wants to be there.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.520]   So that coast between, let's say,
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.480]   June and early September is a zoo.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.480]   What is normally a 20-minute ride in a car or a bus
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.120]   could be an hour and a half stuck in traffic on a one lane.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.520]   That's a bummer when you're on a limited vacation time.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.840]   So what I would recommend is go to Amalfi,
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.440]   but maybe go in May or go in late September or October.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.720]   The weather is still amazing,
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.520]   you can experience it and that's wonderful.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.040]   So another piece to take away
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.500]   from the conversation is seasonality.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.840]   You can always go to Rome, Rome is happening year round.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.580]   Harder to go to a beach in November. (laughs)
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.240]   But the Amalfi Coast in October is still really lovely
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.640]   and you'll have a third of the crowds
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.000]   that are there throughout the year.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.720]   Nearby Amalfi, you've got Naples,
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.120]   you've got Pompeii or Ercanuleo,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.280]   which is the nearby town that's like a mini Pompeii
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.640]   that has incredible ruins that are really not visited.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.520]   You can go walk amongst 2,000 year old homes
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.160]   that were damaged in the ash from Vesuvius in 79 AD
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.840]   and you can just walk around and there's no one around you.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.560]   Whereas in Pompeii, it can be pretty busy.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.240]   So there's little alternatives to each place along the way
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.000]   that you should try to explore.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.300]   But if you don't wanna go south, you can always go north.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.520]   Florence is only an hour and 20 minute train ride from Rome.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.680]   There's trains that leave every 15 minutes.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.840]   It's an incredible town.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.600]   It's like a medieval village that still comes alive today.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.680]   And I actually studied abroad there
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.840]   and did culinary school there in 2003,
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.480]   a little while ago.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.880]   And it was just an incredible place to be young,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.440]   to be alive and to be living in a medieval city of today.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.560]   So great sights and sounds, amazing food.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.280]   If you like pork, that is your city.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.200]   If you like red wine, that is your region.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.600]   And there's a ton to do.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.720]   But let's say you've done Rome and you've done Florence.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.780]   What do you do on your second or third trip back to Italy?
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.800]   Most of your flights are gonna fly either into Rome
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.560]   or into Milan in the north.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.400]   That's where most of the flights
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.640]   from North America tend to land.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.680]   So what I like to do is get off the beaten path
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.360]   and explore other areas that are maybe less popular
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.580]   with North American tourists,
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.200]   but still to me pack authenticity, incredible food,
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.580]   and great experiences into a small area.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.600]   So something to consider might be Umbria,
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.700]   the green heart of Italy that's right next to Tuscany.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.560]   You have 2000 year old villages there,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.680]   in fact, sometimes even older to the Etruscan age.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.400]   You've got incredible food and wine,
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.840]   and you've got a third of the tourists that are in Tuscany.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.760]   And you're probably paying half
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.440]   to three quarters of the price as well.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.040]   So that's a wonderful place if you feel confident
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.240]   and you're okay to get off the beaten path by yourself.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.000]   Even if you don't speak Italian,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.160]   you can get by in Umbria, eat, drink, and see well,
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.440]   and go see some incredible sights and sounds
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.280]   that are unlike anywhere else in the world.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.320]   The last plug I'll make for Umbria, by the way, May 15th.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.520]   Every year, my favorite festival
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.960]   in the whole world takes place.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.820]   It's called the Corsa di Ceri.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.060]   What that means is the running of the candles.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.320]   You think running of the candles,
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.520]   how does that candle blows out when you run?
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.080]   How does that work?
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.720]   These crazy people in this town of Gubbio,
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.700]   they take these huge wooden slats.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.760]   They're like 30 feet long.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.440]   And a bunch of husky men hold onto them.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.460]   And on top of the slats are these big tall columns
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.760]   with a saint on top.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.680]   And they run these candles through the town,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.840]   through the medieval town.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.760]   And the walls of the buildings next to you
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.220]   are like encroaching upon these candles
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.380]   as you run through the streets.
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.120]   And they sing songs and they play trumpets and music.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.440]   And it's insane.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.560]   It's a party and no one outside of Italy goes there.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.680]   It's like, not like it's a running of the bulls
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.540]   or the Tomatera in Spain.
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.760]   It's like this true Italian festival
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.200]   in the heart of Umbria.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.320]   I've only been twice.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.760]   I would love to go back again.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.920]   'Cause it's, to me, it's the most exciting element
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.040]   of seeing people in their thing, doing their thing,
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.960]   living their lives, celebrating their history and culture
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.080]   and having a blast doing it.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.960]   - You said a couple times,
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.800]   even if you don't speak Italian,
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.640]   should anyone be nervous going to Italy
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.120]   if they speak no Italian?
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.200]   - No, because the Italians are the kindest, nicest people.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.740]   And I say that as a overarching stereotype.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.580]   You're gonna have your bad apples for sure.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.820]   But the people who work in trades
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.380]   that tourists are going to be engaging with,
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.300]   restaurateurs, cafe owners, cafe workers,
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.260]   transportation people, et cetera,
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.620]   are really excited that a big lifeblood
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.780]   of the Italian economy, tourism, is back.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.580]   During COVID, Italy was one of the places
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.060]   that locked down the hardest in Europe.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.540]   And it was tough for Italians to even leave their homes.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.460]   Now that you can leave your home,
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.600]   the Italians are so excited to have work again,
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.200]   to have an influx of tourists again, and to see people.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.800]   Look, in 2019, there were 65 million tourists
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.480]   that came to Italy, okay?
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.960]   2022, that number was down by about a third.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.560]   And 2022 was the busiest year for tourism
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.920]   since COVID, obviously.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.200]   So that's quite a difference,
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.280]   going from 65 million to about 40 million
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.680]   in terms of tourists.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.400]   The tourism is huge for a country of 60 million
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.760]   that really relies on tourist dollars
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.280]   and tourist euros, I guess.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.560]   So getting by without Italian is totally fine.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.040]   You may end up in these off-the-beaten-path hill towns
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.000]   where they get fewer tourists.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.080]   You may end up doing the whole pointing thing,
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.040]   the shrugging your shoulders thing
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.880]   when you don't know a word, and that's totally okay.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.740]   The Italians roll with the punches, and they love that.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.880]   So I would not feel worried at all
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.520]   about not speaking the language.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.320]   Instead, I would, maybe if you have a few hours
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.360]   before you go, study up on Duolingo,
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.780]   or brush up on learning some Italian phrases online.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.020]   A little bit of Italian will go a long way,
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.880]   and you'll never have to worry about feeling
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.620]   like you have no idea what you're saying.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.340]   - Any other kind of cultural norms worth calling out
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.500]   so people kind of fit in and don't stand out
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.300]   like American tourists sometimes can?
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.900]   - Yeah, don't try to make a 6 p.m. dinner reservation.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.820]   (laughs)
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.500]   The Italians, they're not the Spaniards,
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.140]   where they're eating at 11 o'clock at night,
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.540]   but they're not far off.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.580]   They do eat on a different schedule
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.340]   than North Americans typically do.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.140]   So breakfast is lighter.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.820]   It's a cappuccino, coffee of some sort,
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.580]   and a croissant, or a piece of bread.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.100]   Lunch is a big affair, and it can go on sometimes
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.820]   for two or even three hours.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.680]   But dinner will take place usually very late.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.140]   Seven o'clock is the absolute earliest people eat
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.060]   in the winter.
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.840]   In the summer, it's even pushed to eight or sometimes nine.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.500]   So if you're walking around and you see the restaurant
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.980]   and it says they open up at 2100,
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.220]   don't think that it's like a nightclub.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.340]   It's actually just their standard business hours for dinner.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.380]   And when we were there with even young kids this summer,
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.740]   we would eat at like 8.30, nine o'clock,
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.340]   and we'd be finishing our meal at 10.30 or 11,
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.300]   and there'd be families with our kids' ages
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.600]   sitting down for dinner at 11 o'clock,
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.640]   which is really crazy.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.640]   - Do people sleep in, or how do they make this work?
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.480]   - They do.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.260]   They sleep in and they take a pausa pranzo.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.140]   They take a big gap for lunch.
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.260]   So if you're working in an office, let's say,
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.720]   from about 12.30 or one, oh, about three o'clock,
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.340]   maybe a little later, you're kind of out of the office.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.980]   People are either eating a long lunch,
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.500]   they're napping, they're just not working.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.780]   They're going for that pasta giatta,
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:15.620]   whatever they're doing.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.300]   But people do tend to take a gap in the middle of the day.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.100]   - And so when you went with young kids,
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.540]   did you just kind of change the time schedule
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.460]   so that they were just up later and sleep in later?
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.500]   - You have to, yeah.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.260]   And we mandated a family nap, not just kidnap,
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.460]   but a family nap every afternoon.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.140]   'Cause in the summer in particular,
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.260]   depending on where you are, it can be very hot.
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.480]   So having a midday nap was a nice thing.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.400]   But, you know, it would be amazing.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.760]   We'd see kids out at 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock at night.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.600]   And then those same kids would be up at like,
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.080]   you know, 9.30 in the morning.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.160]   And I'm like, how do you do it? (laughs)
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.920]   - Easy to meet local Italians.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.680]   What's the vibe like between tourists and locals
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.040]   when it comes to meeting each other,
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.900]   trying to make friends with locals
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.080]   and kind of get a true authentic local experience?
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.920]   - Yeah.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.360]   So I would say the more of an authentic
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.680]   and local place you're in,
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.520]   the more likely you are to meet Italians.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.780]   And what I mean by that is Piazza Navona in Rome.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.220]   One of the most incredible piazzas that there is.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.540]   Beautiful fountains in the middle
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.860]   and benches all around that
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.480]   and restaurants circling the entire piazza.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.580]   And it's an incredible place,
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.180]   but it's not built for Romans, it's built for tourists.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.900]   Romans go there, but if you wanted to meet Romans,
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.940]   you're gonna meet them in the piazza
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.660]   around Santa Maria in Trassevere,
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.300]   the place I mentioned earlier, Trassevere.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.180]   You're gonna meet tourists in tourist places.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.020]   You're gonna meet Europeans or Italians in particular
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.840]   in their neighborhood, where they are.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.000]   So what I would recommend is choose the opportunities
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.880]   to meet with people and seek them out and go find them
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.960]   because you will find them and people will want to meet you.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.960]   They'll wanna hear your story.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.800]   Where are you from?
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.620]   Why are you here?
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.240]   They're so proud to show off their neighborhood
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.960]   or their city or their country.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.800]   And so when they hear,
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.280]   "Oh, wow, you're Californian, amazing.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.600]   I've always dreamed of going to California,"
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.160]   is the thing that they'll say.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.120]   And then they'll be so proud to show you their piazza
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.800]   and they'll be so happy that you're there.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.500]   So find the Romans in their neighborhoods.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.620]   Find the Italians in their cities,
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.300]   not necessarily at the tourist traps.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.140]   - And how are you getting around Italy?
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.680]   Are you flying into one city and renting a car?
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.820]   You mentioned the train.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.100]   I know you could probably even fly between cities.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.500]   - The trains run pretty well.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.380]   I mean, Mussolini did that whole thing, I guess,
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.080]   and electrified and brought trains everywhere.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.860]   And there was some dilapidation after that.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.820]   And the trains nowadays don't run perfectly,
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.060]   but they're fairly reliable.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.860]   So I would say to take a train as much as you can.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.220]   You definitely don't need to drive a car
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.020]   if you're going from city to city to city.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.940]   When you get into the country, the trains don't run.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.040]   And so buses run or private car transfers
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.960]   are very simple and easy to set up.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.580]   If you're gonna be staying in Tuscany or Umbria
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.660]   and you're gonna want to explore from your hotel
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.500]   or your villa, absolutely rent a car.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.180]   Driving in Italy is interesting, it's easy,
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.860]   but I would take caution as you drive
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.100]   because Italian drivers can be a little aggressive,
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.560]   nothing to be scared about or worried about.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.020]   There's no road rage.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:05.900]   They're just gonna pass you by
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.580]   because you're going too slow. (laughs)
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.420]   That's fine.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.380]   Italian towns tend to be very small
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.100]   and roadways even smaller.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.860]   So when you drive from town to town,
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.900]   it may be hard for you to find parking inside the town walls.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.940]   Just park outside and walk in, it's easy.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.740]   Better than trying to navigate your rental car
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.100]   through medieval streets that were really meant
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.740]   for cows and sheep, not for humans and not for cars.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.180]   You don't want to have that on your car insurance bill.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.580]   But as a general rule, it's easier to get around in Italy
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.660]   when you plan ahead and you know the train schedules
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.940]   from city to city and then from there,
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.100]   if you need to take a taxi or a car rental.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.260]   - Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.800]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.700]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.760]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.700]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.660]   and let our sponsor Drizly, the go-to app
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.380]   for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.180]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.020]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.460]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.420]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.900]   or maybe you just want to celebrate
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.980]   that you got through another week.
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.080]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.620]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.380]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.460]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.140]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.700]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.700]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.740]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.580]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.660]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.300]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.780]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.840]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.700]   or go to drizly.com.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.700]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.940]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.080]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.580]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.180]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.820]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.220]   as you build your wealth.
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.480]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.340]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.500]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.580]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.020]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.420]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.380]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.700]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.820]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.180]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.900]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.700]   are first generation wealth,
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.780]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.940]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.260]   and learn from each other
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.860]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.140]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.480]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.900]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.060]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.040]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.540]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.960]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.300]   to your children's education,
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.620]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.060]   So many of these conversations
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.280]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.940]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.820]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.940]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.060]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.180]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.700]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.660]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.300]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.660]   - So you said plan ahead.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.140]   You and I both like saving money.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.260]   Let's say you're planning a trip.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.740]   You've kind of figured out your itinerary.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.180]   What are you thinking you should do ahead of time?
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.360]   Any way to get a deal,
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.940]   whether it's transportation, flights, lodging,
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.980]   what are you thinking about?
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.980]   - Yeah, so it definitely goes to say
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.100]   that the places you know you wanna go, book in advance.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.980]   So that goes for hotels.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.740]   It's obviously a lot cheaper to book in advance
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.140]   for most of these hotels.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.180]   You can book a nonrefundable rate with a lot of them,
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.780]   and it'll save 10 to 20%.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.220]   You can also call a hotel ahead of time and say,
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.540]   "Hey, listen, I see you've got a nonrefundable thing online.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.020]   "What if I went even further and said,
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.340]   "I don't need breakfast?"
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.180]   They might even do a bigger deal with you for that,
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.020]   if you're interested.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.660]   But booking ahead is very important for hotel trains,
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.060]   in particular.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.140]   Your trains will be allowable to book
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.060]   between 30 and 60 days out in Italy,
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.020]   depending on the train line you're on.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.620]   And typically, the cheapest rates are 30 to 60 days out,
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.860]   but highly recommend that.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.860]   Also recommend restaurant reservations.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.860]   At places you must go, book them in advance.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.860]   But don't book every night.
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.100]   Give yourself some flexibility
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.020]   on what spontaneously might happen,
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.020]   what you wanna pop into, where you wanna go, et cetera.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.340]   The places that you have to go,
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.900]   like the Pier Luigi in Rome or Osteria Francescana,
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.740]   if you can get in, and Modena, book those.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.220]   Build your trip around them if you need to.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.940]   But when you're in a place,
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.540]   don't have every single meal booked,
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.140]   because you may wanna have that spontaneity
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.420]   to just eat a bunch of prosciutto on the side of the road,
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.300]   'cause it's really good and it's there.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.060]   - So we talked a little bit about restaurants.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.220]   Broadly speaking, when someone's doing research,
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.980]   is there a reliable site for Italy
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.100]   to figure out where to go, what's good,
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.580]   or what do you recommend?
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.460]   - Yeah, so I use a couple sites
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.980]   as a travel advisor myself,
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.140]   when I'm trying to figure out new and upcoming places
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.100]   to check out or to send people.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.140]   The first is that the Italians have their own Michelin guide.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.580]   It's called the Gambero Rosso, the red shrimp.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.820]   And Gambero Rosso is like the Bible
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.340]   for food and wine in Italy.
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.940]   They have a fork rating.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.860]   So if you get forks, it's a legit place, right?
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:26.700]   You should go.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.340]   Up to three, I believe, or maybe it's four.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.180]   I have to double check.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.820]   But anyway, the more forks, the merrier, obviously.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.140]   So check out Gambero Rosso.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.180]   It oftentimes isn't only in Italian,
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.660]   so you might have to use Google Translate
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.860]   to figure out what's going on.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:39.940]   But that's a great place to find
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.900]   off-the-beaten-path restaurants.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.860]   Look, in a big city like Rome or Milan,
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.060]   any international, whether it's the New York Times
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.780]   or the Michelin guide or even food blogs you've read,
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.620]   they're all gonna have the same general information.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.980]   But when you're going off the beaten path,
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.780]   a Gambero Rosso is incredible.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.620]   And actually, I find the most joy
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.180]   in smaller Italian towns.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.660]   And I find that if you just go a little outside
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.740]   of the tourist envelope,
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.420]   you can have these incredible culinary experiences
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.700]   that are half the price sometimes of the tourist bubbles,
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.300]   but they're so much richer and more meaningful
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.820]   and more connected to the area.
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.580]   An example, I love the Cinque Terre.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.180]   It's one of the top spots to see
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.500]   in the north of Italy on the Italian Riviera
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.820]   in the Liguria state that borders basically,
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.700]   goes from almost Pisa all the way over to the French border.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.140]   And it's this little horseshoe on the Italian coast.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.940]   It's stunningly gorgeous.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.780]   You've got the five towns of the Cinque Terre,
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.220]   you've got Genoa, you've got Portofino,
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.380]   these really iconic and incredible places,
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.100]   but they're very, very, very touristy.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.820]   And so for me, instead of eating in Portofino
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.660]   and spending 15 euro for a panino
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.940]   that I could get three euro elsewhere,
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.940]   I rather go elsewhere and explore
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.780]   and see what else I could find and eat.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.420]   So a great example is a town right next to Portofino
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.980]   called Rapallo.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.780]   I actually have lived in Rapallo on and off
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.660]   a couple of times during the summers,
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.280]   because every time we have a child,
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.780]   we decide that we're gonna go to Rapallo
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.460]   and spend our parental leave there.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.700]   It's just an incredibly magnetic place.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.580]   But Rapallo is a town with kind of nothing to do,
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.100]   but everywhere to go easily from.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.780]   And the eating there is exceptional.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:18.300]   There's a little prosciutto place right on the harbor
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.220]   called Parla Come Mangi, Speak Like You Eat,
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.300]   that's the name of it.
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.740]   And they highlight local prosciutto and salami
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.180]   and cheese makers from around the region
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.400]   and from actually around Northern Italy.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.500]   And that's all they sell,
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.120]   is prosciutto, cheese, salumi, and some sauces.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.240]   It's like this amazing delicatessen experience.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.900]   Again, you don't need to speak English going in there.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.980]   You don't need to know what you want.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.620]   You just kind of go in and say, hey, I like this,
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.780]   and they'll guide you through the whole experience.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.340]   So you could go spend 15 euro
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.260]   for a panino made in Portofino, that's just fine.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.620]   Or you can go spend 15 euro
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.340]   and get three different tastes of things
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.500]   from Parla Come Mangi, and life is good.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.820]   You'll see it in Gambarorosso.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.420]   You'll see it on maybe some food blogs
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.060]   'cause it's now gained popularity.
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.180]   But that's an incredible spot.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.220]   And the same idea, by the way,
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.100]   when I lived in Rapallo,
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.100]   we'd go down to the Cinque Terre for the day.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.460]   We'd go see the five towns,
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.100]   but we didn't have to be there,
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.340]   immersed in them and all of the tourists'
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.420]   sort of onslaught that was there.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.660]   And that, to me, was a great way
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.420]   of seeing and experiencing the culture,
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.620]   but not having to like be enveloped in it.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.380]   We could choose we wanted to see the tourist experience,
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.420]   but we could also live like Italian local.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.180]   So my recommendation is if you're going to some places
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.900]   like Como, Cinque Terre, really popular tourist sites,
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.180]   maybe even Venice, take a look at the nearby areas
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.860]   and say, does it make better sense for me
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.740]   to stay in those nearby areas?
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.660]   And then maybe pop in to the tourist spot
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.500]   for a day or two, as opposed to basing myself
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.580]   in the tourist bubble, only experiencing that.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.740]   - And where are you staying
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.140]   when you're leaving a city center?
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.180]   I know in a lot of countries,
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.100]   it's like there's not a hotel there.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.700]   Are you booking Airbnbs?
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.020]   Is there a different site in Italy
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.020]   that it's for finding houses or apartments?
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.860]   - Great question.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.900]   So Italy has all ranges of accommodation.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.060]   The most expensive hotel in Northern Italy
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.900]   outside of Venice is actually in Portofino.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   It's the Belmond there.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.580]   And it's an incredible property.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.740]   Right outside of Portofino, you have Santa Margherita,
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.620]   you have got Rapallo, you've got other towns.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.460]   And in those towns, there are four and five star hotels
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.100]   that are not the Belmond, but they're lovely.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.980]   And they're a third or a quarter of the price
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.580]   for an interestingly similar level of luxury.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.740]   Not the same, but close.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.540]   You, of course, can go much down market from there
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.420]   and you can find lots of wonderful things.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.180]   The Italians are huge on camping.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.940]   They love camping in the summer.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.860]   So there's actually campsites within towns
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.420]   that have like motorhome or camper van style campers
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.740]   that you can rent sometimes.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.380]   And that's a really fun way of getting local and immersed.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.060]   Airbnb is huge there, VRBO more in the outskirts
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.660]   when you're getting into villas and homes outside of town.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.660]   So you can definitely do that.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.900]   But honestly, what I like to do
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.620]   is look around on booking.com, hotels.com,
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.580]   get a feel for some of the hotels
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.380]   that are selling through those channels
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.740]   that I may not recognize internationally.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.100]   And then I go right to their websites
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.740]   and I find what are their specials, what are their deals.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.580]   I reach out to them through their contact form
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.660]   or through their booking form and say,
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.300]   "Hey, this is when we're coming.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.220]   "We don't need this.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.100]   "We don't need a breakfast.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.060]   "We don't need a suite.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.260]   "We're barely gonna be in the room.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.220]   "What do you got?"
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.380]   And they'll absolutely do a deal with it.
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.460]   The best part about some of these Italian hotels too
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.660]   is that they won't take a deposit.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.180]   They'll just take your credit card.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.220]   And when you get there, you pay.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.460]   So some of them have very flexible cancellation policies
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.260]   as well if you go that route.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.980]   Or if you prepay and you make it non-refundable,
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.380]   you can even get a better deal sometime.
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.220]   - And what about the kind of typical chain hotels?
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.220]   Are they worth considering?
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.180]   Are there Hyatt's, Marriott's, Hilton's kind of thing?
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.020]   - All over the place.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.940]   All over the map, yeah.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.180]   Actually, the funniest thing I think
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.860]   is that the best Western brand here in North America,
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.660]   not exactly the nicest hotels.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.540]   If you go to Italy,
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.540]   they're actually not that bad in some places.
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.580]   And surprisingly, the best Westerns
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.180]   in off-the-beaten-path cities are actually okay.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.300]   And now granted, not my preference always,
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.620]   but it's a good economical way of staying
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.420]   when maybe the competition nearby
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.980]   is another 100 euro more.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.020]   But yes, if you've got Hyatt points or Marriott points
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.900]   and you want to use them in the big cities,
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.300]   there's definitely opportunities to do so.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.420]   In Italy in particular,
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.700]   you should look out for small luxury hotels
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.500]   that are often part of the Hyatt,
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.300]   sort of world of Hyatt program.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.740]   Those oftentimes will allow for outsized value
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.740]   where you can use your Hyatt points
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:27.020]   to save on these boutique hotels
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.980]   that would otherwise be very, very expensive.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.940]   Personally for me, when I'm in big cities,
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.180]   Italy has some of the most incredible hotels
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.180]   that are not parts of big brands.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.420]   So it's really fun to experience some of those hotels.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.380]   There's one in particular,
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.660]   it is part of the Relais Chateau Marketing Partnership,
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.500]   but in Rome, it's called Palazzo Manfredi
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.260]   and it is at the Colosseum.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.300]   And when I say at the Colosseum,
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.420]   I mean there are suites
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.580]   that if you open up your sliding door,
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.340]   the Colosseum is in front of you.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.900]   There is an unobstructed view,
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.980]   nothing between you and the Colosseum.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.820]   That's incredible.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.340]   And where else in the world do you get that?
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.900]   And so sure, you could stay at the St. Regis,
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.300]   which is an incredible property in Rome, beautiful,
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.500]   but you can also stay at the Colosseum.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.740]   So to me, it's like when you're in Rome,
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.060]   when in Rome, when you're in Italy,
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.660]   you should, you know, Il San Pietro on the Amalfi Coast,
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.780]   that family that's been running that hotel for 40 years now,
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:24.540]   they've built by hand every single room into a rock
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.500]   on the side of a cliff overlooking Positano.
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.100]   There's nothing like that in the world.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:29.940]   - Which hotel is this?
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:34.060]   - Il San Pietro, and they are incredible hoteliers.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.900]   They've mastered the art of luxury hotel.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.820]   Food is remarkable.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.860]   It's got a Michelin star and it's in Gambarodo.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.780]   So it's just an incredible experience,
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.180]   but you know, you could choose to stay
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.980]   at like a whatever hotel nearby,
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.980]   or you could stay in this icon,
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.700]   this place that is truly incredible.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.500]   There's nothing like it in the world.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.300]   So when I look at the big bucket list trip to Italy,
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.020]   I look at staying in some places like that.
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.260]   If they're available, if they're affordable,
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.980]   if not, absolutely use your points at the St. Regis.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.540]   It's an incredible place.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.780]   - But it sounds like if you're gonna take
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.340]   three or four trips and you've got points
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.620]   for not all of them, maybe Italy's one
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.420]   where you're not gonna use your points
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.820]   for hotels or lodging.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.660]   - That's correct.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.420]   And I would prepare to find then the boutiques,
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.300]   the other cool places, the three, four, five star hotels,
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.380]   the B&Bs, honestly, that are a good fit
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.380]   for what you want in that city.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.540]   And don't be afraid to look around
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.380]   and comparison shop all over the place,
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.060]   and then reach out directly to the hotelier
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.780]   and say, "Hey, these are my dates, what can we do?"
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.740]   - What about when you're in the city
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.820]   and you wanna do things?
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.300]   Do you need to set up tours?
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.220]   Do you need to set up guides?
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.580]   Do you get lost on your own?
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.500]   How do you find them?
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.620]   What about booking activities, booking thing?
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.340]   - Yeah, all of the above. (laughs)
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.100]   So look, there are some bucket list things
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.380]   that you're gonna wanna see in Rome, right?
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.860]   You're gonna wanna go to the Vatican.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.340]   You're gonna wanna maybe go to the Coliseum
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.180]   if you're into that.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.820]   And so you're gonna wanna pre-book those as much as you can.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.140]   Vatican in particular, the thing I like to do
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.140]   is the Vatican Museum sells this on their website,
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.660]   so you don't need to buy a special tour for it.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.380]   But Breakfast at the Vatican, it's called.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.700]   You actually go to the Sistine Chapel pre-opening,
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.620]   and you're part of a very small group of people
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.060]   that can do that.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.260]   And then you will have breakfast after the fact
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.340]   at the Vatican in their cafeteria.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.140]   That's an incredible way of seeing
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.940]   one of the most amazing sites in all of the world.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.500]   It's usually very crowded throughout the day.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.580]   So getting in a little early
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.380]   is worth the extra dollars or euros.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.140]   Now, if you wanted to completely privatize
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.260]   that experience too, find other people.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.100]   We can do that.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.820]   But that's a lot more money and a lot more consideration
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.700]   than just buying a ticket online.
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.820]   But the dates you know you're gonna be in Rome,
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.060]   especially those dates that may be
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.740]   like you've just arrived the day before,
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.540]   and you know you're gonna be all jet lagged the day later,
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.100]   like buy the early morning tickets.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.100]   Make sure that you get in to have that experience
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.580]   as privately as you can.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.660]   But do leave space for spontaneity and what you might find.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:55.780]   And do feel free to sort of throw your afternoon plans away
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.700]   'cause you're just into the vibe of this cafe
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.580]   or this piazza and you just wanna sit there
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.780]   and watch for a little bit, right?
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.940]   So I like to have structured and semi unstructured time
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.540]   in all the itineraries I put together.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.260]   Now, on a city by city basis, there's so much to do.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.940]   I definitely recommend looking around
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.740]   on various guide websites to see who can do what
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.060]   according to what style of tour or experience you want.
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.580]   You know, there's a Jewish ghetto in Rome
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.780]   and there's a great historical food tour
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.100]   that we often combo.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.060]   And that again, leads into then sitting at a cafe
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.500]   or at someone's restaurant and parlando un po,
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.180]   chatting a little bit for the next three hours
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.020]   after that tour.
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.780]   Or we do a sidecar tour of a couple of these different cities
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.940]   where you actually hop in a motorcycle sidecar
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.780]   and drive around and get to see the historical sites.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.180]   And you never know where you might end up
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.260]   or where you might stop on that tour.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.620]   So some of those kinds of fun experiences,
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.180]   pre-planned with flexibility in the end,
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.420]   works really, really well.
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.820]   - If you don't have plans,
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.300]   I always like taking free walking tours.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.900]   I feel like they're always led by young, excited people
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.380]   who wanna show off their town.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.580]   They're working for tips.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.340]   So that's something you can do in any city I imagine.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.780]   I've found them almost everywhere.
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.220]   So I've said that a lot,
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.620]   but I think it's a great thing to do
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.740]   if you don't have anything planned
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.140]   and you decide you wanna do something
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.460]   and you haven't booked it in advance.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:12.300]   - Absolutely.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.620]   And I would say like, take inspiration from websites
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.940]   that actually have lists of tours that they offer.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.700]   Whether you use those tours or not yourself,
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.540]   take inspiration.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.820]   Understand what they're showing you
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.300]   because that's clearly a good guide
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.940]   for what you should see in that town.
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.700]   And so what I like to do is go look at Context Travel.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.780]   They're great tours.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.660]   We do a lot of them, a lot of work with them.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.420]   Or even like Airbnb Experiences.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.860]   And just see what people are offering in that area
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.020]   so you know what you should focus on
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.540]   or not focus on while you're there.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.100]   But don't feel like you need to buy
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.820]   the expensive private tour all of the places.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.700]   You know, in the height of summer in Rome,
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.900]   in Florence, in Venice, in Milan,
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:48.820]   it's gonna be busy
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.500]   and there's gonna be a lot of people there.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.100]   So maybe you do wanna take a private tour somewhere.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.140]   But outside of those times or those places,
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.220]   maybe you can be okay dealing with some crowds.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.420]   The exceptions to those rules
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.620]   are places that have timed entry tickets.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.180]   The Accademia in Florence, where you see the David.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.700]   Or the Uffizi, where you see Botticelli's work
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.220]   and a lot of the Renaissance paintings.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.900]   Or in Milan, when you wanna go see The Last Supper.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.460]   Those things are very time controlled.
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.660]   You need to have a ticket.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.460]   And you'll see as you research your tours,
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.500]   it'll say, "Hey, this includes a timed entry to blank."
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.340]   But what I would say is some of the best parts of Italy
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.740]   are just getting lost and wandering on your own.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.540]   And maybe you don't know what's in front of you,
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.380]   but that's okay.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.980]   It's beautiful nonetheless.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:29.820]   And you're there.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.580]   And so just be there and enjoy it.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.820]   - I know we hit a lot of places,
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.940]   but I'm curious if there are any that we left off
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.900]   that you wanna talk about.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.580]   - So I think it's important as we record this,
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:44.060]   it's 2023 and the White Lotus is like the thing
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.340]   in the media right now.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.300]   And it's their season two, which was filmed in Sicily.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.940]   And it was filmed at the Four Seasons in Taormina
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.100]   at the San Domenico Palace.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.180]   It's beautiful.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.780]   Stunning property that they put a bunch of money into,
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.980]   redeveloped and it's gorgeous.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.220]   And it's amazing to see the impact of that show
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.220]   and what has happened to travel desire around Sicily.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.580]   Sicily is always a constant for North Americans.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.860]   We wanna go there.
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.660]   A lot of people with Italian roots came from Sicily
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.420]   or had family in Sicily.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.820]   And so people wanna go see their genealogy
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.220]   and they wanna go see the sights and sounds of Sicily.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.060]   So it's always busy,
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.140]   but this year it's exceptionally busy.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.940]   So I would say, A, book now.
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.380]   There's a lot of interest.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.060]   But B, know that Sicily is a place
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.220]   where you could easily spend two weeks
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.540]   and not see a fraction of it.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.220]   The area around Taormina,
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.980]   which is where they filmed White Lotus is incredible.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.140]   You've got the Etna volcano,
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.700]   you've got Catania, Ragusa, Siracusa,
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.540]   all these amazing towns that are on the East side of Sicily.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.460]   Full of history and culture and art and food
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.900]   and food and food and food.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.340]   So you could just spend two weeks there
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.220]   bouncing around from town to town with your own car
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.900]   and you'd be happier than you know what to do with.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:52.860]   But I would also recommend
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.300]   heading a little further West in Sicily.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:59.340]   The town of Agrigento has some of the best Greek temples,
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.820]   better preserved, in fact,
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.380]   than some of those you'd find in Greece.
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.100]   And then there's Palermo, which is incredible.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.660]   Right North of Sicily, you've got the Aeolian Islands.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.020]   The word volcano comes from an island
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.100]   in that little island chain
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.900]   because there's a giant volcano on it.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.460]   It's called Volcano.
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.180]   So I'd go there or Stromboli
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.820]   or some of these amazing places in the summer
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.700]   that have lava and mud baths and beautiful beaches
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.140]   and it's just you and the volcano.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.260]   So Sicily is incredibly in demand.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.260]   Puglia on the heel of Italy,
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.380]   another place incredibly in demand.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.580]   Hotels, especially luxury hotels,
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.460]   are popping up left and right down there.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.540]   And if you like the orecchiette pasta,
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.340]   the kind of ear shaped pasta, that's its home.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.420]   If you like sausage and peppers, that's their home.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.100]   If you like beautiful white sand beaches
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.900]   with no one on them for a kilometer, that's your home.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.620]   And it's an incredible place where you can go and explore,
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.100]   spend a week, 10 days, not see the same thing twice,
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.260]   and eat the best meals of your life.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:01.020]   And it's not as expensive as Tuscany or Umbria
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.420]   or elsewhere in the North.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.440]   So in the South, those are my winners.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.940]   Sicily, Puglia, and they make for great vacations.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.220]   Do keep in mind if you go in the very heart of summer
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.260]   in July and August, it's hot.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:16.660]   Talking could be easily over 100 degrees Fahrenheit each day.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.940]   That's pretty toasty down there, but it's beautiful.
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.720]   And the sea is warm and refreshing.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.740]   Another area that I would also recommend
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.580]   as a side trip from the Amalfi Coast,
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.140]   everyone always goes to Capri.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.500]   The island of Capri is incredible and beautiful
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.780]   and it's stunning.
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.180]   It's a sight to see, but it's also very expensive
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.580]   and it's very crowded.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.660]   And you get the sense when you're there
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.980]   that there aren't really any caprese.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.380]   That's people who live in Capri.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.700]   You don't find the locals.
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.640]   You find people serving tourists.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.940]   So my recommendation would be go to a neighboring island
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:56.300]   right across the Gulf called Ischia, I-S-C-H-I-A.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.580]   There you'll find true Italians.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.560]   It's a place that is volcanic in origin.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.740]   So you have mud baths and hot springs
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.780]   and crazy stuff all over the place.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.380]   You have people who are so happy and so proud
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.540]   to show you their island, 'cause it's less touristed.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.340]   And you have the ability to get around in,
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.300]   whether it's a rental car or a Vespa,
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.420]   or actually they drive these little things called apes,
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.940]   little, called bees.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.280]   They're a little like farm equipment,
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.040]   like a lawnmower with a couple of seats,
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.700]   but they're stylish and they drive you around
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.320]   the island in those.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.940]   And you can really get to know the culture
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.460]   and the people and the restaurants that way.
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.940]   And at a third of the price of Capri.
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.100]   - So I think we hit everything.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.280]   Anything in the north, we moving up the coast, any?
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.500]   Let's talk about the north.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.180]   - In the north, you have Venice.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.020]   And the Venice is an incredible place
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.740]   to go for a night or two.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.300]   If you're gonna stay in Venice
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.460]   and you've never been before,
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.300]   I absolutely recommend you stay overnight,
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.740]   at least one night, probably no more than two.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.420]   The reason is that there's a lot of day trippers
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.660]   that come in and out of Venice.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.740]   And you'll want to see the city at night
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.140]   when most of the tourists leave.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.680]   It's a magical place.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.860]   But if you've been to Venice before
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.020]   and you haven't been to the area around Venice,
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.060]   and that could be anywhere from Trieste,
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.180]   which is all the way to the east, close to Slovenia,
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.560]   or even the Dolomites about an hour or two north of Venice,
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.420]   then you need to go back to that eight region
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.040]   and go see those places.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.040]   The true heart for me of the Veneto,
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.680]   which is the area around Venice,
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.580]   is not necessarily in Venice proper,
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.600]   but it's the area around it.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.840]   It's the rich farmland, the Palladian villas,
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.280]   the beautiful mountains and the other cities,
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.000]   especially canal cities that make that area so rich.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   So I would say, make sure you see Venice.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:36.880]   It's incredible.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.200]   St. Mark's Square, nothing like it in the world.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.420]   And then get out of town.
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.540]   Go see something nearby.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.580]   - I feel like we hit a lot.
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.000]   I think someone listening to this
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.100]   maybe has some inspiration for their next trip.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.180]   - Or they're totally overwhelmed.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.360]   - Or they're totally overwhelmed.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.420]   Maybe listen to it twice.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.740]   You mentioned a few places that you love.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.000]   Are there any other things that when you think of,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.140]   if you were going on a tour through a lot of these places
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.680]   that are like, you gotta eat here,
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.180]   you gotta have a drink here, you gotta have a coffee here,
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.800]   are there anything like standouts
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.480]   that maybe aren't the obvious ones
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.780]   that someone searching blogs are gonna find?
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:08.620]   - For sure.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.960]   As a general rule, as I said earlier,
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.340]   I love looking at Gambaroro.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.620]   So I love looking at the Michelin guide.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:14.980]   I love to understand what,
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.460]   it doesn't need to be three or even two starred.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.060]   What's Bib Gourmand?
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.980]   What is a good place to go check out
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.700]   that's local and legit?
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.540]   And I start there.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.640]   And then I look at actually TripAdvisor in Italian reviews.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.200]   Again, if you don't speak Italian,
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.320]   take the TripAdvisor reviews in Italy from Italian people
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.980]   and Google translate them into English.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.940]   You'll get a real sense of what something is
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.260]   from an Italian's perspective
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.180]   that's different from a non-Italian.
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.020]   Let's put it that way.
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.580]   So I like to read some of those
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.540]   to really understand what's great.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.540]   And then I go back 20, 30 years
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.980]   and see what's still standing in a spot for so long
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.500]   that I need to go to.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.580]   I mentioned earlier that I used to live in Rapallo.
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.300]   There's a coffee shop in Rapallo
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.420]   that's been around since the 70s
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:01.940]   that they sell a particular style of biscuit in the morning.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.220]   I'm not a biscuit eater,
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.460]   but this biscuit with their coffee is like amazing.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.420]   It's called canepa, C-A-N-E-P-A.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.840]   And so it's not like I need to go to Italy to have that,
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.740]   but when I'm there or nearby,
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.260]   that's the only thing I eat for the week
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.900]   or whatever it is of time that I'm in Italy.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:21.900]   In Rome, there's a place called Panella, P-A-N-E-L-L-A.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.500]   They make out of an old school coffee machine,
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.460]   kind of looks like a samovar almost.
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.100]   They pull espresso and then they whip it
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:32.620]   with a zabaglione, egg yolks and sugar.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.540]   And they make this cream.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.220]   And so you can go get an espresso
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:39.060]   with espresso zabaglione cream on top.
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.180]   That is to die for.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.180]   And I could literally, Chris,
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.340]   tell you 150 of these things, okay?
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.860]   But the point is, is that none of these
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.300]   are like undiscovered gems that no one's ever heard of.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.540]   They've been around for 30 years, 50 years, 100 years,
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.860]   doing their thing, selling their one item
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.020]   that makes them spectacular.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.940]   And so every town you go to will have this,
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.180]   from big or small.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.060]   And it's just a question of you seeking them out
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.300]   and finding your own that's exciting to you.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.380]   You may not like coffee.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.860]   And so those two examples I gave you are terrible, right?
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:07.940]   That's fine.
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.820]   But you'll find the thing that makes the Italians,
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.100]   the locals, super proud and makes everybody write about it
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.540]   and talk about it and eat it and drink it
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.020]   and experience it themselves.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.300]   - And if you're someone like me
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.860]   and you're a bit of an over-optimizer
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.380]   trying to find the perfect place,
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.780]   is Italy the kind of place that you can fall into a trap
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.020]   of just walking down the street and picking the wrong place?
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.220]   Or is it just like, just go pick any place
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.460]   that looks crowded with people
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.220]   that look like they're speaking Italian
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.340]   and you're gonna have a great meal?
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.700]   - The latter, for sure.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.980]   If you find where the Italians are,
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.100]   you're gonna have a blast.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:39.140]   If you find a menu in seven languages,
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.980]   beware, you have your hackles up,
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.180]   but know that if you're gonna follow the Italians
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.780]   and get lost and be off the beaten path,
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.060]   and it might be a little uncomfortable
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.340]   'cause you may not speak Italian
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.500]   and you may not know where you're going.
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.180]   Trust your instincts, trust your nose,
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.220]   you're gonna find something great.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.660]   - And you can get back with Google Maps.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.140]   Like it's not, you're not lost.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:55.980]   - Or you could tell people,
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.820]   "Hey, I don't know where I'm going.
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.660]   Can you help me?"
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:58.500]   And they will help you.
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.420]   They're not gonna take advantage of you.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:00.680]   They're not brutal people.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.060]   They're lovely, wonderful people.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.160]   If you start it by saying,
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.740]   "Oh, I'm so happy that I got lost here.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:06.580]   How do I get back?"
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:07.420]   (laughs)
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.000]   They'll help you right out.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.460]   - Our next partner has a product
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.460]   I literally use every day.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.940]   I started taking AG-1 from Athletic Greens
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.440]   because I wanted an easy way
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.380]   to get my daily nutritional insurance
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.300]   and optimize my immune system.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.820]   And it's been in my routine for almost a year.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.140]   Because when you take one scoop of AG-1,
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.660]   you're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins,
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.940]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.620]   probiotics, and adaptogens
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.300]   to help you start your day right.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.820]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.960]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.020]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.540]   and energized for the day,
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:45.060]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.820]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:51.500]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.300]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.380]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one year supply
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.260]   of immune supporting vitamin D
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.740]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:06.620]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:11.260]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.940]   to take ownership over your health
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.880]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.420]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.900]   and supporting the show.
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.740]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:36.740]   Any parting thoughts?
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.380]   We didn't go too deep into specific things,
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.540]   but I feel like you left people with a few ideas
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.420]   of what to try.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.500]   Any other standouts?
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.860]   - We'll talk a little bit about Airlift,
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.100]   getting to and from Italy,
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.620]   because there's a couple of gems here you wanna know about
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.660]   and a few you can avoid, right?
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.980]   So Alitalia, which is actually an acronym,
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.900]   it's now a dead airline.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.460]   It's the old state airline that Italy used to have.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.300]   It died in 2019, 2020.
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:03.020]   But it was A-L-I-T-A-L-I-A, Alitalia.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.080]   It literally means to Italy or the wings of Italy,
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.160]   depending on how you translate it.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.260]   But it was the acronym for always late in takeoff
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.640]   and late in arrival, which is not nice.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.640]   They're dead now and their resurrection
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.340]   is called ITA Airlines.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.580]   It's the same thing.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.620]   I would sort of avoid them if I could.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.300]   They're just meh at best.
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.580]   The business class is fine, but economy's pretty terrible.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.380]   But all of your U.S. carriers,
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.820]   your Delta, United, American, et cetera,
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.540]   they all fly nonstop from Gateway Hubs to Rome
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.160]   and some to Milan.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.820]   But the best experience getting to Milan
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.680]   is gonna be on Emirates.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.140]   Now Emirates flies from JFK to Milan,
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.220]   and then that same aircraft continues on to Dubai,
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:43.500]   and then it goes back.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.100]   So I would recommend if you can get on business class
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.340]   or ideally first on that flight, do so.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.100]   Emirates just recently made changes to award redemption
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:55.680]   for that particular route, which is a bummer.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.900]   But sometimes on Emirates partners like Alaska and others,
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:58.940]   you can still find it.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.300]   So take a look at that.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.720]   As a general rule of thumb,
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.140]   I would actually prefer to fly through Paris
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.260]   if you're gonna fly on Air France La Premiere.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.900]   If you're flying in true luxury,
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.620]   then take a nonstop from North America to Italy.
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:11.920]   Just that extra stop,
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.260]   even though it adds another hour or two,
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.740]   it's such a nicer experience than flying United Polaris.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.580]   But there is gonna be a new United Polaris flight
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.980]   from San Francisco to Rome nonstop coming up starting in May,
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.980]   and that'll definitely help with lift from the West Coast.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.160]   In terms of getting around inside of Italy,
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.740]   none of the airlines that fly intra-Italy are great,
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.340]   so don't splurge for business.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:35.060]   Business class in intra-Italy
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.920]   is literally just an empty economy seat.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.100]   It's blocked off.
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.480]   So it's not necessarily something I would say
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.340]   is worth two or three times the price.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.300]   - Which by the way, seems to be this case
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.740]   with almost every European airline.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.620]   If you're booking an international flight
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.900]   using points in business
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.980]   and you get the intra-Europe flight in business for free,
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:54.820]   why not?
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.300]   But you will be wildly underwhelmed
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.720]   if you've never had that experience
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.700]   because it's literally just a blocked seat in between you.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.540]   - Exactly.
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.400]   - And in fact, if you're traveling with someone,
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.100]   depending on the airline,
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.260]   sometime that seat is actually blocked.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.820]   Like you can't actually lift up the armrests.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:10.660]   - There's a thing there.
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.340]   - Yeah, so if you actually wanna sit next
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.740]   to whoever you're traveling with,
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.340]   you actually can't in those seats.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.340]   So I totally agree there.
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.220]   Any other points, miles tricks?
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.220]   Normally I would do a location episode
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.300]   and do it separately
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.540]   because most of the people I talk to about countries
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.420]   aren't as dialed in on points and miles,
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.580]   whereas you might be.
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:29.520]   Anything there?
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.140]   - Yeah, so I mean, definitely on the hotel side,
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.740]   take a look at using Hyatt points
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.740]   for properties in big cities,
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.300]   especially through the SLH properties.
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.820]   Take a look at using Hilton points.
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:41.900]   There's a few higher end Hiltons
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.100]   that are sometimes not that egregious.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.100]   Usually they're pretty bad.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:48.020]   And then there are a handful of Marriott properties,
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.620]   especially those on Sardinia,
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.220]   that are usually exceptionally expensive,
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.220]   but sometimes allow point redemptions.
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.860]   So usually it's shoulder season,
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.500]   like end of May or early September.
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.740]   But if you can get one of those Sardinian properties,
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.740]   it's normally 2,000 euro a night,
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:04.940]   and it's 60,000 Marriott points.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.140]   Jump on that twice and then some.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.700]   On the airline side,
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.860]   I do like to fly through Northern Continental Europe.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:15.820]   Germany, Switzerland, France, even sometimes the UK,
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.380]   when doing points redemptions,
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:21.180]   because I find that the value of the ticket
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.820]   that I'm usually redeeming for
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.140]   would be greater than the price that I would pay
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:27.340]   for either a nonstop flight from the States.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.580]   I can get a better experience,
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.140]   better bang for my buck out of doing that.
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:32.660]   - Cool, all right.
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:35.940]   Well, Lee, I feel like I'm ready both for lunch, by the way.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.060]   Now I'm both hungry,
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.580]   but I'm also excited for a trip to Italy.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:39.740]   I don't know when it'll happen,
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.100]   because two kids traveling,
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.140]   we're still recovering from the trip to London and Paris,
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.020]   but I'm excited whenever it happens.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:47.980]   - Just want to call out, Chris,
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:51.620]   I have done weekend trips with kids to Italy before.
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:52.540]   It's not an insane idea.
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:53.900]   You can do it yourselves.
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.660]   Choose one city and go, and spend three nights.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.260]   - I don't think that sounds as fun as you make it seem.
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.100]   - Sounds like you're not in.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.220]   - Your kids are older than ours.
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.380]   I don't know if a weekend trip
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.620]   with a seven-month-old is gonna be fun.
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:06.620]   - Yeah, not really too exciting when they're that little.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.220]   - Cool, well, thank you for doing this.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:09.540]   - Thank you, I appreciate the opportunity,
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.940]   and dai, andiamo in Italia.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.780]   Let's go to Italy.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.500]   - That was so awesome,
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.340]   but Lee and I did not get to spend
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.780]   as much time as I wanted talking about points and miles
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.540]   and tactics to get to Italy,
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.980]   as well as how to use your points to stay there.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.500]   So I'm gonna run through a few things,
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.260]   but I'm also gonna share an amazing service I've been using
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.860]   for finding hotel deals with points.
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:32.820]   So when it comes to flights,
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.220]   all the major U.S. carriers,
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.820]   United, American, and Delta fly to Rome from their hubs.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:40.620]   There's a few flights from each of them,
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.420]   mostly from more East Coast hubs to Milan,
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.780]   and then just a couple flights to Venice
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.260]   from the New York area, Atlanta, and Philly.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.620]   Don't forget that Air Canada also flies
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.780]   from Montreal and Toronto to Rome,
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:56.700]   and from Toronto to Venice.
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.540]   So if you're nearby, that's another good option.
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.020]   But there are a couple other airlines
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.220]   that while you can't use points or miles on,
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.700]   I do wanna flag.
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.300]   There's Norse Atlantic Airways,
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.460]   which I talked about on the London episode.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.940]   I'll just bring it up because it is so inexpensive
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:13.700]   to fly from JFK to Rome.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.740]   When I looked on a date in August,
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.740]   it was $328 on Norse Atlantic versus 900
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.620]   on the cheapest flight on all other airlines.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:24.300]   So huge savings there.
[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.220]   It's definitely a budget airline,
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.820]   though they are flying Dreamliners, which is nice.
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:30.420]   So if you're on the East Coast,
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:33.260]   that could be worth looking into, or if you can get there.
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.860]   There's also an airline called La Compagnie,
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.540]   which is I think is a French airline
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.620]   that flies from Newark to Milan.
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.900]   It's interesting because it's an all business class airline,
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:46.020]   but their flights are as low as $3,000 round trip
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.660]   in business, which is a lot less than other airlines.
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.900]   Then finally, another airline that we haven't talked about,
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.620]   you might not know, is called Neos.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.020]   It's Italy's second largest airline,
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.940]   has really affordable flights to Milan from JFK.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:01.380]   I found them as low as $500 round trip online.
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.540]   So that's another one.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.980]   So obviously if you're using points and miles, though,
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.060]   none of those are options,
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.220]   and you're gonna be focusing on airlines
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.700]   that are part of major alliances
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.380]   that you can transfer points to,
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:15.140]   and that's usually gonna be Delta, American, United,
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.660]   Air Canada from North America.
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.420]   Emirates also, as Lee mentioned,
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.060]   that flight from JFK to Milan.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.300]   And then also, if you're willing to change planes,
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:27.580]   Air France, KLM, Virgin, British Airways, Lufthansa, Swiss,
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:28.940]   there are a ton of airlines
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.940]   that you can fly to change planes on.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.780]   But I wanna share a little bit high level
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.220]   of some searches I just did
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.140]   to get you a sense of what's possible.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:39.020]   I went on United's site, I looked for the next month,
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.580]   and it seems very, very easy
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.540]   to find an economy flight for 30,000 points.
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.900]   So that is great.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:48.220]   I imagine if you have points in any transferable program,
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.580]   you could transfer to some airline
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.820]   that's part of Star Alliance,
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.460]   whether that's Air Canada, Avianca, or United,
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.460]   and book something really affordable in economy.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.420]   If you're looking for business, I did find some flights.
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:03.820]   I found a flight through Frankfurt in October and in April,
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:05.620]   and the lowest prices I found
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:08.940]   were about 70,000 points one way on United.
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:10.820]   However, let me walk through an example
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.580]   of how the way you search for some of these flights
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.660]   can make a huge difference in the value you're getting.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.940]   So I just looked for a few weeks from now,
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.420]   April 4th, San Francisco to Rome.
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.660]   I found a flight on United's website for 81,000 points
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.540]   that changes planes in Frankfurt.
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.620]   So I thought, okay, that's not a bad use of points, right?
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.500]   80,000 points for a business class flight.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.940]   Yes, there are some dates you could find it for 70,
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:34.460]   but that's a pretty good deal.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.580]   However, I went to point.me, I did the same search,
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.900]   and what it'll do is not just look
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:41.700]   at where there's availability,
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.100]   but it'll look at the cost to book that flight
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.300]   on all the different airlines you could transfer
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:47.820]   from your credit card programs,
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:51.140]   and find out things like if you transferred Capital One
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.100]   or Amex points to Avianca,
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.420]   you could actually book that flight for 63,000 points
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.780]   instead of 81,000 on United.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.420]   Or because there's a 20% bonus right now,
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.420]   you could transfer from Citi to Avianca,
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.100]   and you only need 53,000 points.
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:10.220]   So for a $3,600 flight, if you only need 53,000 points,
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:13.260]   that means you're getting 6.8 cents per point.
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.220]   And even if you booked with Chase or United
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.740]   and you booked it for 81,000,
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.380]   you're still getting four and a half cents per point.
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:22.900]   And when I looked at the cheapest flight with one stop
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:26.460]   in economy that day, it was almost $1,000.
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.140]   So the crazy thing is if you wanted to use
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:32.620]   that 53,000 points in Citi and book in the travel portal,
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.140]   you would only get $530.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.740]   So you couldn't even book a coach flight there.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:40.140]   And if you took the 80,000 points on Chase,
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.620]   if you had a Chase Sapphire Preferred,
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.540]   you'd be able to use that 80,000,
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:46.900]   and you'd be able to book $1,000 ticket.
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.140]   If you happen to have a Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:51.180]   you'd get one and a half cents in the portal.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.500]   So that 81,000 points would get you a little more
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:57.100]   than $1,200, which would actually cover the economy flight.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:59.780]   However, we're talking about a business class flight.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.340]   So the reason I love transferring points to airlines
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.260]   is because in circumstances like this,
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:06.140]   if you find the availability,
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.980]   you can usually get a business class flight
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.700]   for not too far off
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.100]   from what you would have gotten an economy flight for
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.060]   if you were just redeeming in the portal
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.540]   or you had had a cashback card in the first place.
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:20.860]   So if we assume that in a given year,
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.780]   you spend $30,000 on your credit card
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:27.260]   and you manage to optimize such that you're on average
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:30.060]   getting back two points per dollar,
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:32.780]   or if you had a cashback card 2% back,
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:37.780]   then that $30,000 getting 2% cash back would earn you $600,
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:41.540]   but in points, you'd be earning 60,000 points.
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:44.020]   Well, that $600 is definitely not gonna book you
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.300]   a business class flight to Italy.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.660]   You would need $1,200 just to book the coach flight,
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:50.380]   but you could actually take those points
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:54.500]   and transfer them from Citi or Cap One or Amex
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.060]   to Avianca and get this flight.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:57.940]   So I hope that example is helpful.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.180]   I just wanted to share a few other examples I found
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:01.660]   'cause I know not everyone has points
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.300]   in every single program,
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.460]   but I looked on American and I found a round trip flight
[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.940]   for 115,000 points in business.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:13.580]   I even found a nonstop in business for 100,000 points,
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.060]   which is one way, but in July,
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.780]   which is the peak travel season for Americans going to Italy.
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.100]   So that was interesting.
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:25.060]   And then finally, I did a fun search for the Emirates flight
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.580]   because if you wanna get to JFK and fly JFK to Milan,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.500]   you get a chance to do it on Emirates.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.380]   You could do it on a first class cabin
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.100]   if you want with points that has a shower.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:37.940]   It's really unbeatable, private suites on the plane.
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.140]   It's very hard to find those flights.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:43.220]   And if you find the right time and the right days,
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:44.460]   which takes some work,
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.420]   you can get in business or first on Emirates
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.260]   for under 100,000 points.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:50.740]   Now, is it really worth doing that
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:55.740]   when you could go for 53,000 on Lufthansa or Swiss Air
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:59.100]   or Air France or another airline?
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.660]   That's really up for you to decide.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.180]   It is a unique experience
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.540]   that you probably won't have on any other airline,
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.660]   but it also means that you could probably go two
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.980]   for the price of one when you compare the cost.
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.500]   So that's up to you to decide.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:13.980]   But I will say, when you're doing these searches,
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.620]   in general, the way I approach it is,
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.460]   there's a bunch of airlines that fly the route I want.
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:22.220]   First, I'll go and search on some of these airline websites
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.020]   because they have an easy calendar.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.580]   You can go to the American website
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.260]   and see a month at a time.
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:30.100]   Unfortunately, you can only see from one destination.
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.020]   So you can search from your destination.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.380]   But sometimes what unfortunately happens
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.380]   is that American, for example,
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:40.740]   might not have award flights from San Francisco to Dallas,
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:44.620]   but they might have Dallas nonstop to Italy.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.580]   And so you might be willing to spend a couple hundred dollars
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.060]   to fly to Dallas if the flight from Dallas
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:53.180]   all the way to Italy is free and in business class.
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.100]   So you do have to do a bit of searching
[00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:58.220]   from some of the different hubs where airlines fly from.
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.380]   But most of those airline websites,
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.660]   one of the advantages is you get a calendar for the month.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.140]   So on United, you get this.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.660]   On American, you get this.
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.820]   A lot of different airlines have this option.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.500]   So you can search a wide set of dates
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.620]   and see when the sweet spots are.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.540]   However, I strongly encourage people to consider
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.420]   that once you've found it,
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.300]   don't necessarily book on American,
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.340]   don't necessarily book on United,
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.900]   because there might be a partner airline
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.300]   that's much cheaper to book on.
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.940]   And that's where Point.me comes in and can be so valuable.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.900]   I use it almost every week
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.460]   when I'm helping friends search for flights,
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.460]   when I'm searching for flights for us.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.940]   The only knock I have on it
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.020]   is that there isn't a multi-day search on their website.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.020]   So if your dates aren't flexible,
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.420]   you don't even need to go to the airlines.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.700]   You can say, I'm looking at this day,
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.700]   or even if they're flexible within one or two days, great.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.860]   But if you're looking at,
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.220]   I wanna go somewhere and I could go anytime,
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.460]   Point.me might be tricky
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:54.100]   because you have to search a day at a time.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.220]   That said, I would argue,
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.820]   if you're willing to go in an off season,
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.220]   pick a time that would be good.
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.580]   You could still search there
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:02.500]   and you might find something right away.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.900]   But if you don't, it can be a little bit burdensome.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.100]   But I did wanna point two things out on Point.me.
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.660]   First, as I've said in the past,
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.260]   if you wanna get your first month for $1,
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.820]   you can sign up for the monthly standard plan.
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.060]   And just to be clear, 'cause it's a little confusing,
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.100]   don't go to the, I have a code field,
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.580]   sign up for the standard plan with monthly billing
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:23.100]   that's $12 a month, and all the way at checkout,
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.540]   if you put all the hacks,
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.580]   you'll get your first month for $1.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.140]   However, for the month of March,
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.460]   if you do go to the services page,
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.660]   there is a field that says, I have a code,
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.580]   and there's a complimentary starter pass,
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.900]   which gives you access for 24 hours,
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:40.060]   which normally costs $5.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:43.500]   If you use all the hacks there just in the month of March,
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.180]   50 people can get that access.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.580]   A lot of people are listening to this show.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.500]   I can't promise it'll still be available when you try,
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.020]   but the $1 for your first month should.
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:54.900]   So definitely consider checking it out.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.020]   I am happy paying customer at Point.me.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.700]   I think it's a really great product.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.060]   I've heard so many people have had a great experience.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.060]   And if all of this is too complicated,
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:05.860]   they do also have a consulting service
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:09.340]   where they will just, for $200 a passenger,
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:12.220]   book your entire flight for you with their concierge.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.260]   So that's definitely something to consider
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:15.980]   if you don't wanna deal with this.
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.420]   If we go back to our business class example,
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.580]   if your alternative is,
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.580]   I'm not going to use my points optimally
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:22.580]   because it's too much work,
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.300]   and I don't wanna try to do this,
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.540]   well, in that example,
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:29.860]   if 53,000 points is able to get you a $3,600 flight,
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:31.860]   it would absolutely have been worth you paying
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.500]   an additional $200 for a concierge to go look into this
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.860]   and figure out a way to make it work.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.340]   And by the way, if they don't find anything,
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:42.380]   they only require a $25 search fee to get started.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.260]   So it's a pretty low risk option
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.460]   for people who aren't willing to spend the time
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:48.340]   to go do some of the searching their own,
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.180]   but still wanna get those really, really outsized values
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.700]   from their points.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.700]   So that's flights, but let's talk about hotels
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:58.580]   because there's so many great options in Italy.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.100]   But before that, I wanna talk about Aways,
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:04.100]   which is a really awesome service I started using.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.620]   And it's basically become my de facto way
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.420]   I search for hotels with points these days.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:12.060]   And what I love about it is they show you the cash price
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.820]   right next to the award price.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:14.780]   But even more than that,
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.940]   they show you the award availability.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.740]   So they make it so easy to find
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.780]   which hotels have availability,
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.740]   and you can look at a calendar view
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.020]   of when they're available,
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.020]   and you can compare the cash and the award price
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.260]   to see if it's a good deal.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.180]   It works for Hilton, Marriott, IHG, and Hyatt,
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.260]   and they actually let you filter on your balances
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.180]   with those programs or your balances
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.580]   at Chase, Built, and Amex.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.380]   And they'll factor in things like
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.340]   how Marriott and Hilton give you fifth night free
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.300]   and show you the price respective to that.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:47.060]   Unlike Point.me, they actually have a free option
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.420]   so you can go in and search
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.580]   for the real-time cash and award pricing
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.940]   and get availability for free.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:55.460]   And they do this for over 1,000 cities
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.500]   and over 25,000 hotels around the world.
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.780]   Unlike Point.me, they do have a free service
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.980]   that gives you access to the cash and award prices
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:05.740]   and the award availability.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:08.500]   However, I've been playing with the premium version.
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.380]   They give you features like being able to search
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.140]   for your free night certificates,
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.860]   being able to filter on the pricing
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.700]   for getting your fourth or fifth night free
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.540]   depending on the hotel chain.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.180]   But the real thing that I love
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:23.100]   is that you can get a wider view of the award pricing.
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.500]   So with the gold plan, you can get a seven-day view,
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.340]   and with the platinum plan, you can get a 30-day view.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.380]   But I heard a little rumor that by the end of this week,
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.220]   that'll switch to be a calendar view
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.260]   you can browse for the whole year.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.540]   So if you're eyeing a property,
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.500]   like let's say the St. Regis in Rome,
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.580]   and you wanna see when you can get the best deal,
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.700]   you'll be able to click through the whole year.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.180]   So like I said, you can use the product for free,
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.620]   but if you want all the features,
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.220]   you can use the gold or the platinum plan,
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:50.100]   and you can get a five-day free trial.
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:51.180]   So you can actually go in
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.300]   and play around with this right now for free.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.420]   But for all the Hacks listeners,
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:59.620]   I got them to offer $10 off the platinum plan forever,
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.380]   not just your first year, forever.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.140]   If you just go to allthehacks.com,
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:06.740]   slash aways with a Z, A-W-A-Y-Z.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.740]   I'll also put the link in the show notes.
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:10.220]   Definitely go check it out.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.820]   You can use it for free for five days,
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.700]   or even the free version of it forever.
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.180]   But I will highlight a few of the hotels
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.860]   that I found when I was doing some searching,
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.220]   just to get you an idea
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:22.380]   of some amazing outsized value you can get.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.940]   So within Hyatt, and I'll just caveat
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:27.420]   that if anyone listening isn't familiar,
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:30.260]   unfortunately, on March 28th,
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.180]   Hyatt is gonna change the prices
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:33.980]   of a lot of their hotels.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:35.660]   And it's not all of the hotels,
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.500]   and not all of them are going up,
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:41.580]   but the award cost for 214 Hyatt hotels and resorts
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.420]   is going to change.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.340]   On average, everything's going up
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.860]   about 5,000 points per night,
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.860]   but some hotels are going down,
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:52.860]   and you still have, by the time this comes out,
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.260]   in five or six days to go in and search,
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.580]   which honestly is a perfect opportunity
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.060]   if you have a trip to plan
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.500]   to go use the five-day aways free trial
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.220]   to go find out if you can find a way
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.620]   to get a value from your points
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.180]   before it gets devalued.
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:07.260]   I'll put a link in the show notes
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.820]   to all the hotels that are changing categories,
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.340]   so you can see if they're in that list.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.660]   Obviously, if the hotels you wanna go to aren't,
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.820]   then there's not a lot of rush to do any booking.
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:17.780]   But if there's a trip you know you wanna plan,
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:20.020]   and there's a Hyatt hotel you know you wanna stay at
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:21.420]   that is going up in price,
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:24.780]   definitely get that booked before the 28th of this month.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.140]   But just as some examples,
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:29.980]   within Hyatt, the Park Hyatt in Milan looks beautiful.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.300]   When I looked at a few dates,
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.420]   it was about $1,040 a night,
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.580]   but you could book it for 40,000 points,
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.780]   which means you can get 2.6 cents per point,
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.740]   which is amazing.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.180]   Though, in Milan, there's also the Hyatt Centric,
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.780]   which costs a lot less at 470,
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:47.580]   but is only 15,000 points per night,
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.620]   so 3.1 cents per point value, which is really great.
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:54.820]   And then there's a few Hyatt small luxury hotel properties
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.940]   that are part of that little collection they have
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.540]   that you can get for similar values,
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.260]   like the Hotel Ding Hill Terra,
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:02.180]   which I found for 29,000 points a night,
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.500]   which is really nice.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.940]   On the Marriott side,
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.980]   the St. Regis in Rome and Venice both look beautiful.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:10.380]   Both are over $1,200 a night,
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.820]   but I found the one in Rome for 75,000 points a night,
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.980]   which works out to about 1.7 cents per point,
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.540]   which is really big for Marriott,
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.580]   because Marriott points often are kind of more
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.660]   around the 0.7 cents value.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.620]   And then at the St. Regis in Venice,
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:27.220]   which when I looked was about $1,300 a night,
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.300]   but I found it under 100,000 points,
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:31.700]   which similarly is kind of double the value
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.660]   in terms of what you get for your Marriott points.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:36.300]   So there are some really great spots for Marriott,
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.580]   and all that goes down by 20% if you book five nights.
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.500]   So don't forget that you get your fifth night free
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:45.140]   on Marriott, and you also get the same thing on Hilton.
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:47.660]   And so if you look at Hilton in Rome,
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.500]   there's the Cavallari Hotel,
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.500]   which is a Waldorf Astoria property.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.340]   I found it for a few different dates
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.380]   for 80,000 points a night.
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.780]   But if you don't have Hilton points,
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:59.020]   Amex transfers one to two,
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.340]   so you only need 40,000 Amex points.
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:04.540]   So that was a $746 a night property,
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.620]   which means on the Amex point side,
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:09.220]   you're getting about 1.9 cents per point.
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:11.700]   Or if you book at five nights and get your fifth night free,
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.620]   that bumps up to about 2.4 cents,
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:15.660]   which is still a much better deal
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:20.100]   than using the portal to get one cent per point with Amex.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.740]   Obviously, like in the example earlier,
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.140]   you can get much more value
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.620]   on some of these international business class flights.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.540]   But honestly, if you're not looking to fly business
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.220]   and you want your points to go further,
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:32.180]   you might be more interested in flying economy
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:33.860]   and staying in hotels.
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:34.780]   Or maybe you're just someone
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:36.220]   who doesn't care about the flight experience,
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.100]   you just like a really nice hotel.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.660]   I totally support that as well.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:42.980]   So those are a few of the points options.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.100]   I'm not gonna go through every single hotel
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.540]   and every single property,
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.980]   because when I looked, there were so many.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:52.540]   Marriott has 63 hotels, Hilton has 33,
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:56.860]   Hyatt had 52, and it looks like IHG has another 49.
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:59.460]   So that all adds up to probably 200 hotels
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.380]   you could use your points and miles at.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:04.500]   So hopefully that gives you a little bit of an overview
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.620]   of how you might wanna use your points and your miles
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.860]   to get to Italy, to stay in Italy.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.100]   Definitely reach out to me.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.340]   Let me know what you think of the Aways product.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.300]   I have reached out and talked to John,
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.540]   the CEO of the company,
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:18.300]   and he's definitely open to product feedback as well.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.180]   So feel free to send them an email if you have suggestions.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.540]   There are a bunch of other updates
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.500]   that I've already sent him that some of which he said
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.220]   are coming as soon as this week.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.980]   So I'm really excited to see how that product evolves.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:32.100]   But most of all, I'm really excited to have another tool
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.500]   in the hotel toolkit,
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.020]   because the only site I knew of
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.780]   was a site called AwardMapper,
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:39.820]   which stopped updating things as hotels changed hands
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:42.180]   and changed their rates, and it really became unreliable.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.820]   So really excited that we have a couple tools
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.900]   that you guys can use to book your next trip
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.580]   with points and miles and find really great deals.
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:50.980]   So if you wanna check out point.me,
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:52.780]   don't forget the promo code, AllTheHacks.
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:54.580]   And if you wanna check out Aways,
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:59.340]   don't forget to go to allthehacks.com/aways, A-W-A-Y-Z.
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:00.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.140]   So I would love to hear if anyone is going to Italy,
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:07.140]   plans a trip to Italy, uses any of this advice,
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:09.180]   or even has other tips they wanna share,
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:10.700]   please send them my way.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:13.140]   This whole country series is going to be a thing.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:16.380]   I'm gonna be doing it probably every four to six weeks.
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.740]   So please let me know what you think.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:18.740]   Let me know if there are countries
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.260]   that are at the top of your list,
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.860]   and we'll see what's next.
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:23.540]   Right now, I'm trying to get Brandon Presser,
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.660]   who I did the Japan episode with, to do one on Iceland,
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.020]   because it turns out he knows just about as much,
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.060]   if not more, about Iceland as he does about Japan,
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.660]   which is hard to believe, but really exciting,
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.940]   because Iceland has been at the top of my list
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:39.820]   for a long time, and I've never been able to go.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:42.740]   We even threw out the idea of trying to fly to Iceland
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.100]   and do the episode there,
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.940]   but two little kids is likely gonna make that challenging.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.820]   So thank you so much for listening.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.500]   I hope you enjoyed this episode,
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.980]   and I'll see you next week.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:05.380]   (birds chirping)
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.440]   you
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.500]   you
