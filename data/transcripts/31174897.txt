[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.240]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.840]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.640]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.080]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.480]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.400]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.920]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.200]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.520]   this homeschooling possibility or deep into
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.360]   the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.720]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.600]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.960]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.380]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.360]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to bring a little bit of new
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.160]   to many of you information your way today.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.520]   We're gonna be talking about
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.520]   the Classical Conversations Challenge Plus program,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.720]   and I have a great guest that I think
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.080]   you're really gonna enjoy getting to know today.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.160]   Daniel Shirley is here and he's gonna be sharing with us
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.460]   the whys and hows of the CC Plus world.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.340]   Daniel, I wanna welcome you and thank you for coming.
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.340]   Guys, this is what you need to know about Daniel.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.180]   I have known Daniel for a really long time
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.560]   and I know he's great and he has a wealth of stuff to share.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.400]   So I want you to make him welcome.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.900]   And Daniel, we're really glad for you to be here.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.900]   - Yeah, thanks, Lisa.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.300]   I'm glad to be here as well.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.260]   - I happen to know that you know a lot
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.180]   about the challenge program from the inside out,
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.180]   so to speak.
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.620]   Tell us, what was your life like as a student,
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.460]   as a tutor and director?
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.220]   And I also want you to share with people what you do now.
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.540]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.460]   So definitely starting Classical Conversations
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.620]   at the, I guess what, it's not a ripe young age,
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.460]   it's the opposite.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.300]   (laughing)
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.100]   - A tender young age, let's say.
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.940]   - Yeah, there it is.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.940]   A tender young age of seven and then having the blessing
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.800]   to move through the different levels of foundations,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.260]   repeat all the cycles a bunch of times
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.220]   and then transition into the challenge program
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.100]   where I had just a really great,
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.140]   it was kind of like an all-star suite of challenge tutors
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.580]   that I was really grateful for, of which you won.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.340]   And so that's fun.
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.460]   - That is fun.
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.860]   - Yeah, I mean, moving through Challenge 4, graduating,
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.380]   we didn't have the senior thesis
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.660]   when I graduated Challenge 4,
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.540]   so that's something that I'm envious of now
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.300]   for my current students.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.260]   And so I've been directing Challenge 4
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.100]   for about four years now as well.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.720]   And so I'm up to that at least one day a week, most weeks.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.180]   And then we have been doing
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.980]   the Classical Conversations Plus program.
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.260]   And now for around the last two to three years,
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.180]   I've been managing that program
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.700]   and just trying to make sure
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.140]   that our students really have every opportunity
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.740]   that they can possibly have,
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.980]   that we can possibly provide them
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.500]   to enter into that kind of college portal
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.500]   and be comfortable and confident
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   as they're kind of moving through that threshold, so.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.260]   - That sounds really cool, Daniel.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.100]   And I know that our listeners are excited.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.460]   I'll tell you the truth.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.460]   Whenever parents get a chance to hear from a student
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.460]   who has been through the program, they're very excited
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.680]   because all of us moms and dads, when we start out,
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.420]   we have great hopes for our kids.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.620]   And we put a lot of faith
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.240]   in the educational path that we choose.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.920]   And so lots of us, just like your mom, my friend, Heather,
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   just like your mom, I grabbed on to Classical Conversations
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.300]   as a great vehicle for my family
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.240]   to navigate this homeschooling journey.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.360]   And I believed that it was the right thing.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.600]   And I believed my children would learn all of the skills
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.760]   that they needed to learn and be exposed
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.380]   to all the big ideas and great conversations
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.600]   that I really hoped for them to have.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.000]   But you really don't know how it's gonna turn out.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.520]   And you have to believe in it because it's a lot of years.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.520]   You wait for 12 years and you think, okay, did this,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.280]   did all the good stuff rub off on them?
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.280]   Was I able to help rub off all the rough edges?
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.440]   Have I prepared my student to go forth
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.760]   and be a lifelong learner,
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.640]   be a self-supporting good citizen of the world
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.960]   and of God's kingdom?
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.080]   And so, Daniel, I want you to know you're representing
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.440]   and parents are listening to you thinking,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.800]   okay, so this is what it could turn out to look like.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.460]   This young man sounds like he has it all together.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.100]   So I appreciate you being transparent
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.320]   with my listeners today.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.120]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.120]   And I think one of the things,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.160]   I mean, I wanna kind of revisit that idea
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.240]   of the rough edges, is my student going to have
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   all the rough edges sanded down, so to speak,
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.640]   when they are finished with the challenge program,
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.240]   graduating out of challenge three or ideally challenge four?
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   And it's really one of those things
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.380]   where the edges are still gonna be rough every time.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.320]   The edges are still rough in many ways.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.900]   And so we're not finished work yet
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.860]   and we're still continuing to grow
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.860]   and face challenges beyond college and family life
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.940]   and figuring out what this kind of epic human journey is.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.900]   But this is all part of the classical tradition, right?
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.340]   That's what we signed up for in the first place
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.780]   was this continual lifelong journey of forever approaching
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.780]   this kind of end of human beings that we see as Christ.
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.780]   And that's something that's always gonna be ongoing.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.700]   But one of the things that I remember,
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.020]   particularly in my own experience as a student
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.180]   in the challenge program, was the first time
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.300]   that I went from foundations into challenge A.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.180]   And I think this has relevance to parents
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.560]   that are wondering, are my kids gonna be able to engage
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.020]   with the college world after coming out
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.260]   of the challenge program?
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.480]   The first assignments that I had to pull through
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.020]   in challenge A, I remember my birthday falls
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.540]   in October each year.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.300]   And so it was like week six or seven
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.980]   and we were doing some kind of geography assignment
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.540]   and I can't remember what continent we were drawing.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.260]   But I remember having the challenge guide in front of me
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.380]   and looking through my assignments during that week,
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.300]   the week of my birthday.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.840]   And for every previous school year,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.860]   I had always gotten my birthday off.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.460]   It's like, I didn't have to do memory work,
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.700]   I didn't have to do my math.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.140]   But now I had this external accountability
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.380]   to my challenge director and this kind of syllabus really
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.380]   in the challenge guide.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.700]   And in the sixth or seventh grade, sitting there,
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.400]   realizing that I still have to finish this on my birthday
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.020]   and I'm gonna move through this assignment
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.540]   and pace out my work.
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.540]   And if I do that correctly, maybe I have my birthday off.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.900]   It was like the acquisition of responsibility.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.900]   And I very much, when I entered into college myself,
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.260]   the experience was very similar going from foundations
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.980]   to challenge A or going from challenge four into college.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.040]   It was like, we've kind of been doing this,
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.860]   really like this school wise.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:46.940]   - I think you hit on what is a very common experience
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.060]   for families and for students who come through the program.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.220]   That's how it was for my girls.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.220]   They went to college and looked around them
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.300]   in the first several weeks and thought,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.140]   "Yeah, this is what you're supposed to do."
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.620]   You get the syllabus and you look ahead
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.580]   and you plot out your course and you say,
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.500]   "Okay, there's a paper here and there's a paper here
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.420]   "and there's a project here.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.260]   "And oh, and this class has one too."
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.540]   And so you just naturally begin thinking,
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.900]   "How am I gonna juggle this?
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.620]   "And what do I need to do when?"
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.820]   And my girls looked around and saw a lot of anxiety
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.500]   on the part of some of their suitemates and hallmates
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.180]   and realized that one of the best things
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.700]   that a classical education with classical conversations
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.420]   had done for them was to prepare them
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.420]   to be the master of their own work,
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.940]   to be the architects of how their time was gonna be spent
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.660]   and to feel competent to do that.
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.980]   And it wasn't all brand new.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.660]   And so that's a really good insight, Daniel,
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.020]   that I think that parents who are listening
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.500]   can really put in the bank and put in their back pocket
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.100]   and think, "Okay, so I'm doing a good thing."
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.940]   And I appreciate you offering that insight.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.540]   I don't know, would you say that that was the best part
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.740]   of the challenge program to you,
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.180]   that you were prepared to manage your own time
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.020]   and your own life?
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.180]   What would you say was the best part of challenge?
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.260]   - Yeah, I think that functionally,
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.580]   it seemed like that was the advantage
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.620]   of the challenge program.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.060]   One of the advantages was definitely the structure
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.300]   of the one day a week in community
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.820]   and then the other days at home,
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.820]   forcing you kind of into this self-paced mode
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.660]   of sorting through your own work
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.420]   and deciding what days you were gonna do what.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.460]   And really, if the home is structured this way,
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.460]   the child is moving into that domain of responsibility,
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.500]   then the parent isn't maybe over-nurturing
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.580]   and structuring all of their work.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.460]   - Right, right.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.300]   - He's like this.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.700]   Then the function of managing your own time,
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.220]   scheduling your own work and accomplishing the tasks,
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.420]   I felt like was very formative.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.420]   And so those patterns of work ethic are, I think, huge.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.260]   I mean, favorite part, definitely not,
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.580]   definitely not the development of work ethic.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.700]   I don't think, looking back, it's like, that was good,
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.540]   but it's not fun.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.380]   - Exactly.
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.660]   - My favorite part of the challenge program
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.540]   or the best part of the challenge program
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:42.540]   has got to be the development of the soul of the students
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.620]   and then the fruition of it in the challenges three,
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.900]   like challenge three and four programs.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.260]   That's gotta be the best part.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.860]   As a student, go ahead.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.220]   - No, I was gonna say, so flesh that out a little bit.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.300]   What does that look like?
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.500]   What does that feel like for the student
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.740]   and for the family that's watching the student?
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.580]   - Yes.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.660]   So it can look, obviously, a thousand different ways,
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.980]   more than a thousand different ways,
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.580]   'cause there's more than a thousand different students
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.740]   inside the challenge three and four programs.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.580]   - Yes.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.380]   - But as you grow and move through the programs
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.220]   as a student,
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.340]   the first thing that is definitely real
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.940]   inside the experience of the student
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.940]   is that that kind of hitting the age of 16 and 17 and 18,
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.300]   and the world just kind of opens up.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.900]   And I know we live in a different world now
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.100]   than it was 12, 13 years ago,
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.380]   whenever I was in the challenge program,
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.580]   but the challenge program kind of mirrors
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.060]   this increase in activity in the life of the student,
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.380]   whether it be they take a part-time job on,
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.060]   or they're in a relationship that's all-consuming,
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.980]   or they're really into a particular hobby
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.860]   and investigating, yeah, what comes next,
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.500]   all of those things.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.940]   The work actually kind of dials back
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.540]   in the challenge three and four years,
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.220]   as far as quantity of assignments
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.940]   and these different exercises that the students are doing,
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.580]   and it dials up in conversation.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.460]   And so from the experience of the student,
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.540]   it was my, I enjoyed it to a certain degree
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.500]   when I was going through it,
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.980]   but now being on the other side of it
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.900]   and leading it and guiding it,
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.660]   and just watching the structure of the program
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.580]   shift and change into welcoming the opinions,
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.620]   the thoughts, the experiences of the students
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.780]   in the classroom, and having that be essentially
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.020]   the centerpiece of the challenge three and four years,
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.900]   was really, really wonderful.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.900]   And so going through it and retrospectively,
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.940]   I think that challenges three and four
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.500]   are definitely the highlight.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.220]   They're definitely the most fun.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.060]   We're all philosophers at that point.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.460]   - Yes, yes.
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.740]   I'm so glad to hear you say that.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.660]   That's always kind of what I have heard.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.900]   My girls enjoyed that too,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.780]   in those same kinds of ways, Daniel,
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.500]   and as I've talked to friends who have students
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.380]   who are coming up into three and four
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.940]   and who are now graduating,
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.460]   they are echoing your sentiments.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.420]   It is such a blessing to these students
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.420]   to who have developed these rich long-term relationships
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:39.060]   with friends, peers, who have wrestled
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.220]   with the same big ideas and have read
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.780]   a lot of the same things,
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.540]   but might have completely different opinions
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.300]   or thoughts about what that means
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.980]   and what should be done with what I now know.
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.860]   And I think there's so much excitement
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.700]   and so much richness and so much satisfaction
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.580]   when those students have the opportunity
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:08.580]   to wrestle with big ideas and agreements and disagreements.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.620]   It is so cool, and it always made me sad,
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.660]   and it made my daughters sad too,
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.380]   for some of their friends to drop out.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.620]   Some of your buddies did not stick all the way
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.660]   with challenge through graduation.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.660]   Okay, I've heard lots.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.860]   As I traveled as a practicum speaker
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.100]   and as I have lived a lot of years
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.860]   as a challenge director, I have heard all kinds of reasons
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.220]   for families and students not sticking it out
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.180]   through challenge three and four.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.820]   What have you heard from families who leave
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.580]   after a year or two of challenge?
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.460]   Yeah, I think one of the common,
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.940]   there are two really common things that I hear.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.420]   The first one is, I think a little bit of an illusion.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.460]   It's not quite accurate, but they think that challenge two
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.500]   was such a difficult year workload-wise,
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.060]   that if things just continue to ramp up past that point,
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.420]   which they assume it will, like it'll get harder
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.660]   and harder in 12th grade, then they leave.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.060]   Because they're like, if challenge two is this hard,
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.660]   then there's no way we can do the rest of it.
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.540]   And that's what I wanted to mention
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.940]   a little bit earlier too, is that it actually,
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.860]   the workload scales back.
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.100]   Like the students do less project-oriented assignments,
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.980]   even though they're still there.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.860]   The emphasis really changes into that
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.620]   more discussion-oriented student leadership element
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.260]   of the challenge program.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.220]   And so that's one reason.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.700]   They think it's gonna get a lot harder,
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.460]   and it actually gets a lot easier.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.700]   So that's something-
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.100]   Preparation-wise.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.780]   Yeah, because so much has gone into preparing the mind
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.340]   of the student, that by three and four,
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.900]   they don't have as much to prepare ahead of time.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.940]   It's all the beauty and the glory of the conversation.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.180]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.140]   So that's the first reason
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.020]   that I've heard of families heading out.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:20.020]   The other reason is intimidation by the content usually.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.980]   And so as you get into challenge three,
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.860]   you've got the introduction into chemistry,
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.980]   which a lot of parents will feel intimidated by,
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.980]   a lot of homeschool teachers will feel intimidated by.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.460]   You're engaging in literature that's more complex
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.380]   with Shakespeare in challenge three,
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.580]   and then the "Alien," the "Odyssey,"
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.780]   and the "Aeneid" in challenge four.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.420]   You're dealing with larger history books,
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.460]   the "Discoverers" and "Patriot's History,"
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.780]   and you're dealing with just more complex material
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.420]   all the way around.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:57.260]   I think that if you recognize
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.260]   that that material doesn't have to be easily approachable
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.500]   your first time through,
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.580]   you don't even really have to understand it.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.420]   Mark notes are okay,
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.060]   and that however you can participate in the discussion
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.380]   is the emphasis, that's the goal and the direction,
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.940]   not total mastery of the content.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.380]   'Cause like I said, we're gonna be rough
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.300]   around the edges for a long time.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.540]   If you want to be a perfect interpreter of the "Iliad,"
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.900]   you're gonna have to read that book 100 times,
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.580]   and you're not gonna do that
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.140]   by the time you're 17 most likely.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.140]   And so recognizing that patience
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.980]   and just abiding in and attending to the things
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.940]   that have been placed before us are important,
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.100]   and so not to leave that too hastily
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.100]   because we're assuming that we need mastery over the content.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.780]   I think those two things are the reasons
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.660]   that people tend to leave.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.980]   They think it's gonna get a lot harder
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.780]   after challenge two, and it doesn't.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.500]   And then challenges three and four
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.860]   seem to have the most complex content,
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.860]   but it's there for us to attend to, not to master.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:12.020]   - That is a great insight and a wonderful encouragement.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.700]   I love that it's there for us to participate in,
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.380]   not necessarily to master.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.660]   And it's a really good reminder, Daniel,
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.380]   to all of us that there's no way
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:29.380]   that we are going to master everything that we touch fully
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.740]   by the time we're 17 or 18 years old.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.340]   And, you know, a classical education,
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.340]   if we really believe the classical model,
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.340]   we should always remember that it is repetition
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.020]   that is gonna bring greater and growing understanding.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.260]   And so it's really encouraging to hear you say,
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.700]   just read the Iliad, read the Odyssey,
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.940]   sit through your calculus class,
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.100]   watch the physics experiments
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.020]   and immerse yourself in the experience.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.540]   Something is bound to linger and to last with you.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.860]   And, hey, if you really want to master this,
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.340]   you're gonna have to read it more than once anyway.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.540]   I love that, I love that.
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.300]   I know that some of the families
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.460]   that I have served as a mentor to,
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:32.460]   as they approach these upper challenge years,
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.820]   many of them began to say things like,
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.500]   well, we're gonna do the upper challenges,
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.900]   but not fully because we wanna do some dual enrollment.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.340]   We just feel like for a lot of different reasons,
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:55.340]   they were interested in dabbling in the college experience
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.580]   while their student was still in high school.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.180]   And like I said, lots of reasons.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.500]   I had some parents who said, you know,
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.740]   I want my child to have a little bit of college
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.860]   under their belt while they're still living at home with me.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.980]   And I'm still there to talk about big ideas
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:17.980]   and potential scary ideas and first-time ideas with them.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.580]   And then some people were just saying, you know what?
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:26.500]   Our family financial concerns are a concern.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.700]   And so we need our children to do dual enrollment
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.540]   so that we don't have such a big college built.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.220]   There are just tons of reasons.
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:40.300]   Tell us, tell my listeners about CC+
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.300]   and how that could address family's needs or desires.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.900]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.700]   You know, CC+ has been around for a long time.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.260]   And so I actually, I did CC+
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.980]   when I was in the challenge program.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.860]   And so it's been around- - Did you?
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.900]   - I did, yeah.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.900]   It was very different, way worse than it is now.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.820]   - Well, everything that we start new,
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.220]   we're not good at yet.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.380]   So we're figuring it out. - Exactly.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.540]   - So you were in the, let's figure this out position.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.380]   - Yes, 100%.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:23.140]   And so the iteration of CC+ that I was in,
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.980]   whatever, 13 or 14 years ago,
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.020]   it was the American History Strand in challenge three.
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:33.620]   And it was aligned to the curriculum to some extent,
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.620]   but we had to sit in a college class,
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.860]   like online before online classes were really a thing.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:43.700]   - Oh gosh.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.020]   - It was a chat room.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.020]   Like, I don't know if you remember like-
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:47.860]   - Oh wow, yes.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.980]   - (indistinct) and that kind of thing, old school.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.620]   It was like that, but for an hour and a half
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.780]   and the professor would type things
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.780]   and then the class would type back
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.380]   and the text was all colorful.
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.460]   - Oh gosh.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.700]   - That's how CC+ kind of started.
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.340]   And since then it's had a lot of development,
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.300]   especially in the last couple of years.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:15.900]   But the way that CC+ works really at the vision of CC+
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.980]   is to equip homeschool families
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.460]   and open kind of open college doors for homeschool families,
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.580]   particularly classical conversations families.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.300]   And it does this by partnering with,
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.980]   regionally accredited universities,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.820]   designing courses with them that overlap
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.820]   with our challenge curriculum
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.460]   so that students can participate
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.780]   in this quote unquote dual enrollment strategy,
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.780]   gain college credit,
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.860]   while not having to sacrifice the attention
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.140]   that I was just talking about,
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.820]   that you should pay to these Shakespeare texts
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.940]   or ancient literature or Patriot's history,
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.020]   some of these things.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.780]   - So our CC+ now actually uses
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:12.580]   classical conversations challenge material
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.220]   to get college credit
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.260]   for what our students are doing already?
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.900]   - Yes, that is true.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.820]   It functions, the term that we use
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.620]   and we're trying to get more clear with this
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.820]   in the CC+ program,
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.980]   'cause there's actually several programs
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.220]   that fall underneath the domain of CC+.
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:35.220]   And so the quote unquote concurrent enrollment program
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:40.380]   is the program where Southeastern University
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.260]   has basically looked at our challenge content
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.940]   and said, you're meeting these objectives
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.580]   for these college courses, these college credits.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:55.580]   And so we will step in and vouch for you essentially
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.620]   to accredit these challenge courses.
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.300]   If students are willing to opt into that kind of,
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.780]   to the CC+ concurrent enrollment program,
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.780]   SEU basically grants them credit
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.020]   for completing their challenge work.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.460]   - Wow, okay.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.220]   And that's concurrent enrollment, gotcha.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.340]   - Yeah, concurrent enrollment is the term.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:24.060]   I do wanna say that the overlap is not a 100% overlap,
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.940]   meaning that students don't complete everything
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.780]   in the challenge guide to get college credit
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.900]   from Southeastern University.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.900]   And students don't only complete the listed assignments
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.140]   in the challenge guide to get college credit from SEU.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.380]   And so there's a fun back and forth here.
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.860]   The CC+ classes are always quote unquote less work
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.580]   than what's actually in the challenge guide.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.380]   There are fewer assignments to complete
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.980]   'cause we don't need everything in the challenge guide even.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.660]   - Right, yeah, that's a very ambitious program
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.580]   of activity and thinking.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.420]   - Yes, it is.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:06.860]   And so, but at the same time,
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.900]   in order to satisfy some college requirements
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.260]   and regulations, all the very,
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.140]   the fun stuff, the bureaucracy,
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:20.540]   there are certain assignments that are not exactly imitated
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.540]   in the challenge guide, but they are in spirit similar
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.420]   to the assignments that students are already doing.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.420]   So for example, in the challenge two composition one course
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.060]   that we have with CC+, where students opt in
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.740]   to turn their British literature essays in
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.380]   for college credit, we have a timed writing assignment
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.340]   on week eight, and the university says,
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.140]   you have to do this timed writing assignment.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.820]   All comp courses have to have this timed writing assignment
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.100]   in this section of the course.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.300]   And we say, that's not in our challenge guide,
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.100]   but students do a blue book.
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.900]   They'll do a blue book at the end of the semester.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.220]   So we encourage families to say, hey, pay attention to
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.540]   and look at the assignments for the CC+ courses
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:16.500]   of which you can find all of the assignments pre laid out
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.020]   for you to evaluate whether or not you think this overlaps
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.380]   with the way that you're engaging
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.060]   with the challenge program.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.100]   Those are all on our student information portal.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.940]   All that information is available, course codes, titles,
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.980]   assignments, it's all there.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:35.740]   But the spirit of that is that students are doing
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.340]   a blue book, which is a timed essay already.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.460]   And so we're just saying, think of that
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.020]   as being bumped up seven weeks.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.260]   And then do the, it's a blue book exam
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.100]   that you're taking just a little bit out of step
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.980]   with the rest of the program.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.140]   But that's a lot of detail.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.900]   So I don't know if it's helpful or not, but.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:03.180]   - Yeah, I think that detail is great.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.940]   And a lot of our listeners are gonna be interested
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:07.980]   in the detail.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.980]   And so if they want to revisit
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.820]   and they don't wanna listen
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.580]   to the whole podcast again, Daniel,
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.060]   where can they go?
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.180]   Where can families go to find out more
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.980]   of this information about concurrent enrollment
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.500]   and other ways of participating in CC+?
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:31.700]   - Yeah, so that would be classicalconversationsplus.com.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.860]   We just did a new website and so that's fun.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.540]   You can see our four programs
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.420]   across the top of the page there.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.060]   We've got something for CC students in challenge.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.900]   We've got something for challenge graduates.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.220]   We've got something for parents.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.460]   We've got gap year programs.
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.460]   So check that out for sure.
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.260]   The concurrent enrollment program,
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.540]   if you click the get started button on the website,
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.460]   there's a page that it takes you to
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.500]   and a student information portal
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.100]   that's linked on that page.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.100]   It has 29 course descriptions
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.020]   for the CC+ concurrent enrollment program
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.180]   where you can go in and get a full roadmap
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.420]   of what these courses look like
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.980]   before signing up for them even.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.140]   So I would highly encourage families
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.340]   to go in and check some of that out.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.540]   - Okay, that's great.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.780]   So classicalconversationsplus.com
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.900]   and you will be able to see all four
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.300]   of the types of programs that CC+ offers
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.940]   and find out the details so that you can evaluate.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.940]   For instance, if this concurrent program,
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.540]   the concurrent enrollment might work
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.380]   for your family's goals for your student.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.140]   Okay, so tell us what are the advantages
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.700]   of being part of CC+?
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.660]   What are the advantages for students
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:00.460]   and maybe what might a parent think of as the advantages?
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.580]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.940]   So one of the things that's very fun
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.500]   is that we have this relationship
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.740]   with Southeastern University called directed mission.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.340]   And so one of the common quote on like anxieties
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.180]   that parents will have is my student's
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.740]   not a good test taker.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.220]   They're not good at ACT, SAT, CLT,
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.460]   any of the acronym tests.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.780]   And with the CC+ program,
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.620]   you actually end up being able to kind of sidestep
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.700]   those standardized tests through this term
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.020]   that we call directed mission.
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.860]   And you can look it up.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.700]   There are colleges all over the place.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.500]   They're starting to formulate these directed mission
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.300]   agreements with different institutions.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.180]   But if you're a CC family, a parent or student,
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.420]   and you apply to Southeastern University,
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.220]   indicating that you're a CC family,
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.980]   again, that's an important step.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.420]   - Right, right.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.060]   - You are directly admitted into the institution.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.700]   And so you're accepted automatically.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.060]   That's a big deal.
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:13.740]   And so one of the other benefits,
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.300]   I talked to my students in challenge four
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.460]   when they're doing their senior thesis.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.500]   Say if you sign up for a CC+ course,
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.900]   you get access to a university level library.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.420]   And so you can actually-- - Oh, that's cool.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.180]   - Yeah, dive in and do the research that you wanna do,
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.860]   really fortify your arguments and your ideas
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:37.660]   with scholarly sources and dig in in a way
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.740]   that otherwise it can be kind of hard to do
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.020]   if you're trying to dance around
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.500]   and pull abstracts off of Google Scholar
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.260]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.620]   Yeah, we've all been there, but--
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.060]   - Absolutely.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:50.900]   - Yeah.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.820]   And then the other thing in general,
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.060]   we've done this more recently,
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.540]   but we launched this undergraduate program
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.660]   with Southeastern University.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.020]   This undergraduate program really embodies
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.260]   the spirit of CC+ is opening college doors
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.900]   for homeschool families,
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.460]   because this is one of our programs
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:18.300]   that's open to both students that have graduated
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.020]   from challenge four,
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.380]   as well as classical conversations parents
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.740]   at any point during their classical conversations journey,
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:31.220]   where you can get a up through a bachelor's degree
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.620]   with Southeastern online.
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.860]   And the tuition is just, is crazy low.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.100]   I think it ends up being about $3,000 a semester.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.900]   And so, like trying to equip,
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.500]   I know we've had the master's program
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.140]   for a little while now,
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.660]   but I've had questions come in from people like,
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.340]   well, what if I don't have my bachelor's degree yet,
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.820]   but I still want to do this program?
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.380]   And so we've been pulling this together
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.500]   for the last little while.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.580]   And so I'm really excited about it.
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.500]   And I hope more and more families will continue
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.060]   to take advantage of the opportunity
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.740]   to finish out a bachelor's degree,
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.740]   to kind of check that box so they can pursue either our EMA
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.900]   or whatever other program they're excited to do.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:23.180]   - Yeah, that is such an advantage for families
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.140]   because I'll tell you, Daniel,
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.020]   there are a lot of moms and some dads out there as well,
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.380]   who when they begin,
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.620]   they feel like God's led them to homeschooling,
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.660]   but in the back of their mind is the strike
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.380]   that they didn't finish college
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.780]   or they didn't go to college.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.860]   And who am I to be doing this with my children?
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.860]   And even after they begin to redeem their own education
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.100]   and they really understand
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.660]   that it is about the classical tools of learning
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.100]   that are approachable by everybody
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.340]   and they are doing the work,
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.820]   there's still in the back of their minds,
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.780]   this little seed that says, but you don't have your degree.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.660]   And so this is huge for families
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:14.180]   who are all about lifelong learning,
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.060]   but would love to have that degree in hand.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.460]   What a blessing.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.300]   That's awesome.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.780]   That is awesome.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.260]   - It's very exciting.
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:28.100]   And really, again, it's there for families to use
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.180]   however is helpful to them.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:34.180]   And so really there's not a right or a wrong way
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:38.700]   to use CC+, the concurrent enrollment program,
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.140]   undergraduate program, master's program.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.700]   They're there for families
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.900]   to be able to enter into this college space
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.580]   in whatever way kind of suits them best.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.340]   So we try to make things as open and flexible as possible.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.340]   We try to preserve families' attention,
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.500]   preserve families' finances.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.460]   And so through our partnership with SEU,
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.500]   they've really made this possible.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.340]   And I like to encourage families like check it out,
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.500]   hop on board, see what you think,
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.780]   at least learn a little bit more about it
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.180]   because this relationship with Southeastern University
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.100]   is super, super cool.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.500]   I don't exactly know how the Lord has placed us
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.900]   in this spot to have this relationship
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.620]   with this institution, but check it out
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:31.380]   because it's definitely a unique opportunity.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:37.260]   If you want to look up average tuition for college in 2024
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.660]   and then compare with some of the numbers,
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.060]   I can tell you, but it really doesn't do it justice
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.340]   unless you kind of do the research yourself
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.940]   and figure it out, but just compare it a little bit.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:56.940]   And I think you'll probably come to the same conclusion
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:01.740]   that I have, which is just that it's a huge,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.460]   huge opportunity for as long as it lasts.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.980]   And so just really grateful for it.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.180]   - This has been so exciting to me, Daniel.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.700]   And I will confess to you that what I thought
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.860]   that I really wanted to know about
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.780]   was more the concurrent enrollment.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.180]   And actually, I think I might want to have you come back
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.820]   in a few weeks to talk about,
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.660]   or maybe sometime this summer,
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.700]   as families really begin to consider
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.100]   if they would like to do a concurrent enrollment
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.020]   with some of their older challenge students,
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.020]   'cause I'd love to talk specifics about that,
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:46.020]   but what I think this has been as a surprise to me
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:51.700]   was how much more CC+ is
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:56.220]   than just that concurrent enrollment avenue.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.620]   And the biggest mind-blowing blessing to me
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:04.620]   is just what a blessing CC+ can be to families
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:10.300]   with students at every level.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.540]   Like you said, current challenge students,
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.660]   challenge graduates, parents,
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.900]   people who are looking for a gap year program.
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:23.180]   What I want to suggest to our listeners today,
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.740]   what I want to suggest to you guys is go check it out.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.660]   Go to classicalconversationsplus.com
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.820]   and find out what's out there for you
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.180]   and see, like I have seen today,
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:42.180]   that there's a whole lot more than maybe we ever considered
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:46.460]   and that this might be what God is calling your family into,
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.980]   and we didn't even know.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.340]   We found it on the way to something else.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.340]   And so thank you, Daniel, for bringing that up.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.940]   And will you come back and talk to me again
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.780]   about the concurrent enrollment program?
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.820]   - Yeah, absolutely, I'd love to.
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.460]   It's been a great time.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.140]   I've enjoyed your hospitality.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.580]   - That will be great.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.580]   So listeners, Daniel and I will get together
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:13.700]   and we'll try in the next several weeks to roll this out
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.700]   because I feel like a lot of you may be thinking,
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.900]   hey, this might be just the thing
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.180]   for my overachiever challenge student
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:26.580]   or for our family to see how college
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.860]   and this student match up well.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.820]   So you stay tuned
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.380]   and we'll get you more information on that.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.700]   One other piece of information that I wanna share with you
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:41.060]   about something that is out now,
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.620]   you guys have heard me talk a lot
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.900]   about the Copper Lodge Library books
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:50.180]   that Classical Conversations Multimedia put out.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.660]   We have a new edition of the Copper Lodge Library
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.980]   called English Epic Poetry.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.060]   It's a collection of English poetry.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:07.060]   It does include a lot of the poetry
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:14.300]   that your student will read in the challenge program.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.140]   It has Sir Gawain and the Grey Knight,
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.500]   selections from Canterbury Tales,
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.260]   there are parts of Paradise Lost in there.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.340]   The cool thing about our editions
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.580]   is that the collection includes an introduction
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.220]   that gives you historical context for the pieces
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.020]   as well as tips for reading epic poetry.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.460]   And there are a lot of footnotes
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.820]   that will help you with hard parts of the text.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.380]   They're also, the books are really beautiful
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.020]   and they're bound so that they're really wide,
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.060]   nice wide margins, which encourages our students
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.580]   and all of us as readers to take notes
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.500]   and really be having a conversation with the book
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.820]   and with the author as you read along.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.300]   So if you are interested in this new edition
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.820]   from the Copper Lodge Library,
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.180]   go to copperlodgelibrary.com
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.140]   and you can find out how to get a copy
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.860]   and see what other titles are available.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.180]   So thanks for being with me today, guys.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.580]   Daniel, thank you again,
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.420]   and I'm already looking forward to our next conversation.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.260]   - Until then.
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.060]   - All right, bye-bye.
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.660]   (gentle music)
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.720]   you
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
