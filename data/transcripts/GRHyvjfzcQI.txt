[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   I'm absolutely struck by this stride comes before sprint thing and I'm remembering back to
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.360]   cross country where they say we're going to do a stride workout at the end of a run we get back to
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.520]   the track at school and they do some strides and I'm just chuckling to myself because I always
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.780]   would tell myself in subsequent years you know okay I'm going to sprint but I'm going to sprint
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:34.100]   at you know 50% of my all-out speed yeah so I always think of all-out speed for me as um somebody's
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.540]   chasing me with a syringe filled with poison okay and I've got to get away okay um that's all-out
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.740]   speed I don't want to die so 50% of that 60 70 you know it's you know and I'm measuring it subjectively
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.080]   I'm not doing this by heart rates or anything like that and indeed anytime I've done 100% all out like
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.140]   in my mind imagining you know someone trying to try to really take my life and I'm running all out
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.320]   I end up with this lower back thing because of the you know it you get hurt yeah um but striding sounds
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.400]   like something that people could work up to how do you know after doing the skip workout that you
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.580]   described that you're quote-unquote ready to stride and start doing a stride workout and I should mention
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.240]   that the these workouts because we did one yesterday um you finish them feeling great this is an aspect
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.100]   of exercise that I think most people don't talk about unfortunately that this leave it all on the mat
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.840]   you know you take every set to failure in the gym or you're you know these long runs where you're just
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.220]   shredded that they're not great for teaching people how to be healthy because people are exhausted
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.940]   afterwards they're tired they over train quickly and then people say there's no such thing as over
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.780]   training it's like yeah if you can sleep all day eat all day and your profession is to do this
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.620]   but there is a such a thing as having a stressful life and wanting to be healthy and exercising and trying
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.260]   to incorporate that in a way that feeds the rest of your life yeah and I think these workouts that we
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.800]   did the workout we did yesterday excuse me um left me feeling you know posturally energetically
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.020]   mood wise it's feeling great I slept great last night felt great this morning
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.280]   I had a great workout in the gym as I mentioned earlier so I want to encourage people to give this
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.360]   a try and in doing that I want to give them a roadmap so a warm-up of 10 to 15 minutes
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.440]   50 meter or so skip um could they do it on lawn dirt or concrete does it matter no it doesn't
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.900]   great yeah if you've got a really flat grass perfect okay but if you if you don't and do it on
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.860]   concrete no problem okay so basically no cost to this except a little bit of time and attention
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.940]   um 10 to 15 of those you know 50 meters out walk back repeat after a warm-up and if you need a little
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.220]   bit longer recovery than the probably 90 seconds it takes to walk back take it not a big deal the
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.300]   quality here is a term determining factor as you said you're not trying to get really fatigued from
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.520]   plyometric work this is a plyometric session you want to be kind of fresh going into each one and that's
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.620]   going to take you know for most people doing a maximal skip over the course of 50 50 meters it's
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.420]   90 seconds is about enough but if you're really explosive and you're a really good skipper it might
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.960]   be three minutes that's fine as you said you want to feel good at the end of that you don't want to be
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.720]   beasted at the end of that now if you can do it where you're if we transition say from the skips
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.280]   and you can stride really well and if you can stride really well maybe you can sprint really well
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.240]   really well that doesn't necessarily mean that you shouldn't be tired at the end of the session
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.200]   but the quality of the movement has to be the governor there not the capacity not i got to get
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.720]   the work done and i don't care how that work looks or what it looks like i just got to get it done no
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.980]   with high intense work with sprint work your governor is always the quality of the work what does it look
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.780]   like what does it feel like it's a lot like resistance training in that way 100 always quality
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.120]   so um how does one transition into striding and what what what does that look like this is saying okay
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.660]   i'm gonna i'm gonna sprint but it's not a sprint because i'm gonna hold back a bit but how do you
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.160]   hold back and still have the expressive part because the expressive part it's a little hard to describe
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.360]   in words but yesterday you were encouraging rob and i to get us you know tall with our posture
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.000]   as if we're being pulled up by a string from our heads and it has a profound psychological effect and
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.240]   then you just feel your your body opening up in natural movement you don't have to think about
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.080]   coordinating the hand lift it just you're in you know like this full bowing out it's really wonderful
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.320]   if we describe the difference between all of the gait patterns just through the amount of space that you
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.840]   take up on the planet so when you when you walk it's a small space when you jog you're taking up a little
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.800]   bit more space when you run it's a bit more space when you start to stride it's more space again and then
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.520]   when you sprint you're up here and you're being maximally expressive so just think about it from that
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:06.000]   perspective the other part is jogging and running typically happens behind your center mass you crash
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.440]   onto the ground and you push back you have this propulsive phase there's not a lot of a break of
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.280]   braking phase here there's a long propulsive phase that happens with the foot pushing back behind the
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.000]   center mass striding and sprinting happens in front of the center mass there's an actually a longer
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.320]   eccentric phase where you drive a lot of force into the ground it's in front of the center mass
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.960]   and then you propel yourself off and it's a very short propulsive phase so think about it that way so
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.560]   it's a bigger shape and it's primarily more in front and it's also as i said this is important
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.920]   you can't sprint and most of the people that are listening to this cannot sprint are you telling us
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.960]   to not sprint no no i'm what i'm saying is you do not have that strategy available to you
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.240]   most of us like everybody who's listening to this almost everybody will be able to walk
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.640]   and if you can walk as you said you could probably jog and most of the people on the planet can walk
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:10.160]   jog and maybe they can run most people on the the planet can't stride they can't get any faster than
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.440]   75 of what their capacity is because they will they just can't do that anymore if you're a kid you can do
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.440]   that you can run you can you can stride along all day but you get to a certain point where our tissues
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.800]   and our joint systems and we just do not have the capacity to run that fast safely and we definitely
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.320]   don't have it when we're sprinting and the difference here is when you're striding it's essentially a pretty
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:41.280]   simple traditional spring mass system the body acts as a spring just whether it's 50 on the front
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.640]   side 50 on the back side you hit and you bounce off you hit and you bounce off where sprinting is a
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.520]   little bit different this is the work of dr ken clark is a good friend of mine that he he published
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:59.840]   this in i think in 2018-19 it's called a two mass system where it's not the body is not acting as a
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.120]   spring there's a secondary mass of the shank and the foot that's contributing to up to about eight percent of the total
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.840]   force through contact so this elite sprinter is hitting the ground so hard that so there's another
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.440]   mass that's added to the spring and that's what i'm saying that's not available to you because you can't
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.320]   move your limbs fast enough and you don't have the range of motion that's big enough to be able to get
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.880]   that sort of velocity there's a dozen players in the nfl that can do that every elite sprinter
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.800]   is actually a sprinter most every other athlete and most every other sport can't actually sprint
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.680]   they're just they're operating as spring mass they don't have that secondary mass because they can't
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.280]   move their limbs fast enough when dr peter tia was on this podcast and elsewhere he talked about
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.000]   one of the major causes of death mostly in older people is they'll fall
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:02.480]   they'll be mobile they'll catch some sort of infection related to contact with the bed or
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:10.800]   you know post-surgical lack of circulation and that's what takes them out i was shocked to learn
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.400]   this right i mean i thought it'd be heart attack or cerebrovascular disease or that instead but that
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.200]   led to this whole notion that i think is gaining more popularity nowadays that part of longevity is
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.120]   maintaining things like grip strength one's ability to jump and land and jumping and landing is eccentric
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.240]   control yeah my mom's turning 80 this year and she's fortunately in very good health
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.360]   my dad's already 80 he was on this podcast and for anyone that saw that he's clearly in very good health
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:48.000]   but i worry about them and i worry mostly about a step down off a curb a step going down a stairwell
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.760]   that is not controlled and then a slip and then a fall and then the break and then the immobility and
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.960]   then the the sequence that atia and others have referred to would skipping be a good activity for
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:08.080]   people in their 60s 70s or 80s to undertake carefully as a way to learn eccentric control
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:15.520]   because i'll be honest i've seen some wonderful inspiring videos of people in their 70s and 80s jumping
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:23.600]   off of boxes doing plyo type work in the gym i don't know many folks in their 70s and 80s who
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:30.240]   are going to embark on that yeah but you can skip kind of small skips then you can do larger skips you
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.120]   can skip anywhere it's free if you approach it carefully you probably don't even need a trainer
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:41.840]   there's some videos now of you having us skip and um i you know here i'm like inspired to start a
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:48.160]   skipping movement uh with you um for all these reasons uh you don't need even need a piece of
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.440]   equipment probably even do it barefoot on grass if you couldn't afford shoes right 100 what are your
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   thoughts on folks who are um in the 16 up club yeah um skipping yeah i think you've nailed it i think
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.120]   that is so important that eccentric control or the eccentric capacity is the one that we really lose
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.600]   the ability to handle ourselves eccentrically is just it's it's we don't do that work anymore
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:20.000]   everything that we do is concentric in nature and uh it is it's not just elite sport i said before that
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:29.760]   the differentiator is always in the eccentric force capacities in elite sport also in us in gen pop
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:38.240]   we have we lose the ability to apply eccentric force whether it's fast or maximal so 100 i think it's so
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:47.440]   important my dad um was an elite athlete when he was younger and has probably averaged four days a week
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:55.840]   running for almost his entire life good for him yeah he's 78 in 2019 he ran the new york city marathon
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:05.760]   ran 502 so he's at 74 or 73 years old and he doesn't do that anymore but he still runs four days a week
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:12.960]   and he runs about 20 to 25 miles and two of those days are skipping sessions where he walks 30 seconds he
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:20.240]   skips for 30 seconds and then he strides as fast as he can as fast as his capacity will allow for 30
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.240]   seconds and then he walks then he skips and then he strides and he walks and it's it's it's so key
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.080]   it really is like it's it's for me like the ability to express yourself maximally through
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.520]   running and i've already said i don't feel like most people can do this
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.840]   i don't know if there is a better single metric to as a measurement for
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:52.640]   whatever word you want to use here vitality or health then the ability to safely express
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:58.720]   maximal speed of you as you as an individual like you choose vo2 max you choose all of these
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:04.000]   different things that you might come up with i don't feel like any of them are as good as the
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.320]   ability to just run maximally so let's start with that if we feel like that is important
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.880]   and you can argue whether whether it's the most important or the 10th most important we know it's
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.880]   important if we know that's important how do we get there and as you said i think skipping is the way so
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.280]   i'm on board with the skipping movement let's get everybody skipping because it is as i said this
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:31.200]   is your ability to be plyometric to work on those eccentric force capacities and move in a way in
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:41.280]   which you can actually express yourself again
