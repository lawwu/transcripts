[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.440]   I will give you thanks with all my heart. I will sing praises to you before the gods.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.180]   I will worship toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name for your lovingkindness
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.280]   and your truth. For you have magnified your word according to all your name. On the day
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.560]   I called, you answered me. You made me bold with strength in my soul. All the kings of
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.320]   the earth, O Yahweh, will give you thanks when they hear the words of your mouth, and
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.200]   they will sing of the ways of Yahweh, for great is the glory of Yahweh. For Yahweh is
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:58.600]   high, yet he sees the lowly, but the one who exalts himself he knows from afar. Though
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.600]   I walk in the midst of distress, you will revive me. You will stretch forth your hand
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.200]   against the wrath of my enemies, and your right hand will save me. Yahweh will accomplish
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.680]   what concerns me. O Yahweh, your lovingkindness endures forever. Do not fail the works of
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.560]   your hands.
