[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   In the following sermon which was recorded on Christmas Day 1961 in the Westminster Chapel,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones is preaching from the first book of Kings, chapter 8, verse 27,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   and from the Gospel of John, chapter 1, verse 14.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Now, there I'm reading out of the account which is given of the real opening of the temple that was built by King Solomon.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   You remember how the children of Israel had worshipped God in that tabernacle, that tent which they had made,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   and according to God's instructions, and which they took with them wherever they went.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Whenever they wanted to worship God or to seek his guidance, they would go to this tabernacle.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   But now David, at the end of his life, had conceived the idea of building a permanent house,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   no longer a movable tent, but a permanent house, the house of God,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   a place in which he and his people could meet together with God.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   But you remember that he was not allowed to do so, but God indicated that this should be done by his son.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And so when Solomon came to the throne, he proceeded to build this great temple,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   the temple of God, where he and the people might worship.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And here in this chapter, this eighth chapter of the first book of Kings,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   we are given an account of how everything having been finished, the great day came,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   when the temple should be dedicated.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And what we find is this.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   that the cloud filled the house of the Lord,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   This temple, you remember, was divided into various sections.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   There was a kind of outer court, and then there was a place called the holy place.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And then beyond that, beyond the partition, was a place called the holiest of all.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And it was there that there was a representation of the visible presence of God.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   God's Shekinah glory was to be found there in the holiest of all.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   There was an ark there, with a cherubim over the ark, and this glory overshadowing everything.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And into that place, that holiest of all, only one person was allowed to enter,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   and that was the great high priest.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And this high priest even was only allowed to go in once a year.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   He went in with the blood offering of the people to make atonement for sins.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And there he sprinkled it in the presence of God's glory as represented by the Shekinah.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Well now, that's the background to this statement that we're looking at together.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   God, as it were, had promised that he would meet with his people there,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   that he would, as it were, come down and meet them when they went there to worship him.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And what we've got in this verse is the expression of astonishment on the part of King Solomon.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   The great thing at last has come to pass.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   But in a sense he can't believe it, he can't accept it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Will God indeed dwell on the earth?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens can it contain.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   How much less this house that I have built.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Is it possible, he says, that God really is going to come down and to meet with us
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   there in the holiest of all in this temple that we have erected to him and to his glory.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Well now, I want to make use of this in order that we may consider together
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   what is, after all, the great and the central message of Christmas.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   This which we have met together to celebrate today.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It's often a very good thing to approach New Testament truth
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   through one of these Old Testament adumbrations,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   through one of these old prophecies, one of these foreshadowings.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Every part of truth is presented in the Old Testament in a more or less material manner.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It's an accommodation to the state of the people at the time
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   there is an element of progression in God's revelation.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And thus it often happens that we are given great light upon this wonderful thing
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   that is recorded in the New Testament by the imagery which we find recorded
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   in the Old Testament scriptures.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And it is in that way that I want to use this this morning.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So let me put it to you in the form of the following thoughts.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The first thing then by which we are confronted is this fact, this astounding fact.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   What happened at Christmas?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Well, what happened at Christmas was that God came down to dwell on earth.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I remember hearing of an old preacher, an old Welsh preacher,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   preaching on this very text that I'm trying to preach on this morning.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And he handled it like this.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   He first of all gave out his text.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And the Welsh translation would go something like this.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   "Is it true indeed that God will dwell on the earth?"
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And he read his text several times.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   "Is it true indeed that God will dwell on the earth?"
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And then he paused and looked at the people and said, "Yes, perfectly true.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Perfectly true."
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And that's really all we can say this morning.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   That is exactly and precisely what has happened.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   God has come down to dwell on earth.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   The little children's hymn puts it,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   "I love to hear the story which angel voices tell,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   how once the King of glory came down on earth to dwell."
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   That's it.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Now here I say we are confronted with a fact.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And you've noticed the hymns we've been singing have already brought it out.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   "Pleased as men with men to dwell."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Jesus.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Well, who is Jesus?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   He's our Emmanuel, which means God with us.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And another of our hymns have put exactly the same thing to us.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   "God shepherds in the field abiding, watching all your flocks by night."
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Listen, said this heavenly choir.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   God with men is now residing.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   That's the thing.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   God has come down to dwell on earth.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   That is why we can think of it in terms of that statement in John 1, 14 also.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   The word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Now the meaning of that word is "tented," lived in a tent, tabernacled amongst us.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   In other words, he has literally and actually come down from the realms of glory
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and has come to dwell on earth.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Now I'm concerned that we should hold firmly in our minds that this is a literal fact.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   This is not a mere story.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   This isn't a fairy tale.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   There have been brilliant men, geniuses, who've got vivid imaginations,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   and they've drawn on their imagination and have pictured wonderful things.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   You can read it in their mythologies and in their various stories.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And the great danger is, of course, that we tend to assume and to think of this mighty event
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   in that kind of term and put it into that kind of category.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   But that's not the thing.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   This is the truth, that God the Son, the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   has literally and actually come down to dwell amongst men.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   It's not a story, not fancy, it's not a figment of the imagination.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   We are dealing here with sheer history, solid fact,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   the same sort of thing as we record when we say that Julius Caesar conquered this country in 55 BC.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Now that's an actual concrete event.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So is this, Stilmarzo.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   That's why you call that 55 BC, before Christ.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We are living in 1961 AD,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Hanno Domini, all because this literal event took place.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   It's not a fancy, it's a fact.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   In the same way, we must point out, and particularly as we are looking at the Old Testament,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   that this is not what is called a theosony.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Those of you who are familiar still with your Old Testaments
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   will know that repeatedly in the Old Testament we are told about the angel of the covenant,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   who suddenly appeared.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   You remember he appeared to Abraham on certain occasions,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   some strange being, the angel of the covenant.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And it's been generally agreed by expositors throughout the centuries
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   that the angel of the covenant is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   But he appeared only in the form of a man.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   That wasn't his incarnation.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   He was able to appear in human form for a while,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and then disappear again, and go back to his glory.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Now that's what's called a theosony, a kind of appearance.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   But what we are dealing with, as we think of what happened on that first Christmas morning,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   is not a theosony.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   It isn't a mere temporary appearance of the Son of God.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Oh no, this is something which belongs, I say, solidly and literally to history,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and it's factual.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   He literally came to dwell amongst men.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   He was truly born as a babe.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   He took on human nature.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   He was a real child, as every other child is a real child.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   That's the thing, I say, which we must hold on to.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Will God indeed dwell on the earth?
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And the answer is, that's exactly what happened.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   That is precisely what took place.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   The second person in the blessed Holy Trinity left the carts of heaven,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and came down on earth to dwell.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   God living on earth amongst men.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Now this, of course, is the fact of all facts,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   which brings me to my second thought, which is this, the marvel of the fact.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   That was the thing, of course, that was in the mind of Solomon.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   That's the thing he couldn't get over.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Is this possible? Why?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Well, he gives the reason.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   He says, "Behold, the heaven, and heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   how much less this house that I have built."
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   He said to himself, and says to God and to the people at the same time,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   "Is it possible that God can come and dwell in this temple?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's a very big building. It's a magnificent building."
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   The instructions were, you remember, that it should be exceeding magnificent.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   But yet, says Solomon, though this is a very great building,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   it's not great enough to contain God.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Why, the heaven, and the very heaven of heavens, can't contain thee,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   for God is omnipresent. God is everywhere.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   God is, well, there's no limit to God. God is.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Is it possible that God can, as it were, come down and localize himself in this way?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   That God is there in the holiest of all?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And that we can meet with God there?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Is this thing possible?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   The thing is so stupendous, he marvels at it.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And here again, of course, we are led immediately
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   to the thing that should be uppermost in our minds
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   as we meet together on this Christmas morning
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   and think of what happened there in Bethlehem.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It's the same thing.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   But in a sense, it's much more glorious and wonderful.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   There was a representation of the glory of God.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   God actually was not there.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   He gave a representation of himself in the Shekinah glory.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   But we've got something truly astounding and amazing to consider.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   What is it?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Well, here it is, isn't it?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Solomon was amazed that the glory of God could be confined, as it were,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   to this temple, this great building.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And he's surprised because God is the creator after all,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   and how can the creator be confined to a building?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Perfectly right.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   You remember how Stephen, the martyr Stephen,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   in preaching to those Jews, he makes the same point.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   He says, "God dwelleth not in temples made with hens."
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   The Jews have materialized all this.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   And God was only in the temple.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   And if you didn't worship in the temple, you couldn't worship God.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   You couldn't worship anywhere else.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   He was wrong in all that.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   And so the argument was a perfectly fair one.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   The God who has made everything can't be confined to temples made with hens,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   because he is God.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   He's the creator, the sustainer of everything, the omnipresent God.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And yet, the thing that brings us together this morning is just this,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   that something infinitely more wonderful has happened.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   God, whom we can't conceive of as being confined to even to a great temple,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   a mighty building,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   has literally and actually been confined to something very much smaller than that.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   The heavens of heavens can't contain thee,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   but the virgin's womb did contain him.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   The virgin's womb.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   The everlasting Son, the Word,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   the one through whom, as we've been reminded, all things were made,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   and without whom was nothing made that is made,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   the sustainer of everything,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   has been confined to the virgin's womb.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   That's what we are celebrating, my friends.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   This is the astounding and stupendous thing.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Solomon was amazed. What about us?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   The Lord of glory in the virgin's womb.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   God confined to a womb.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And then, of course, being born, there he is, a little helpless infant,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   the one, I say, who made everything,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   the one who sustains everything,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   can be held in the hands of people, helpless.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   They put him there.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   There he is, born in a stable.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   God confined to a stable, indeed even to a manger.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Now, this is the thing, you see, that we are reminded of.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Will God indeed dwell on the earth?
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Is it possible that God's going to be there?
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And heaven of heavens cannot contain the how much less this house that I have built.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   But here I say, you have the very Son of God in all his infinity of glory,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   confined to a womb, to a stable, to a manger,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   rarely dwelling amongst men.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Well, let Charles Wesley say it again for us.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   We've just been singing that magnificent hymn of his,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   possibly the greatest hymn in the whole of the hymn book,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   "Veiled in flesh."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   What? The God-hymn, see.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   There he is, the God-hymn.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   That babe, that infant, that helpless child, the God-hymn.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Veiled in flesh.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Confined, as it were, to flesh.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Hail, he says, incarnate deity.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Now, that's what the authorities like to call the paradox, and it is a paradox.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   This is God, and this is God's way of salvation.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   This is God coming down.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   The Word was made flesh.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Tabernacled amongst us, and the tabernacle was his flesh, his body.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   This thing in which he was veiled, and all his glory was conceived.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   It's all there, but it's veiled in the flesh.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   It's confined, as it were, by these earthly conditions.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   He had become man.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   This is the whole essence and meaning and glory of the incarnation.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Well now, let us try to ponder and to work out at leisure for ourselves
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   something of all, of what all that involved and meant for him.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   You've got a perfect commentary upon it all in the Apostle Paul's statement
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   in the second chapter of his epistle to the Philippians.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   "Though he was equal with God."
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   He counted it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   There it is.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   He was equal with God. He was in the form of God.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   He had been that from eternity, in the beginning was the Word. He always was.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Co-equal, co-eternal with the Father, sharing the same substance, part of the same triune Godhead.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   But he didn't hold on to that.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   He didn't count this as something to be held on to, at all cost, to be clutched at.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Instead of that, he humbled himself.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And he made himself of no reputation.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   No, that doesn't mean that he emptied himself of his Godhead.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   That's inconceivable.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   God can't empty himself of Godhead. That's something that God cannot do.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   God is God.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   There's no such thing as emptying of Godhead.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   No, no. What it means is this.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   That he took on another form.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   He's still the same, but he appears in a different form.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   He's always been in the form of God, in the glory everlasting from eternity.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   But now, he enters into time, and he comes in another form.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Takes on just another form, same person, same God the Son, but in the form of a man.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   In the likeness, in the form of a man, in the likeness of a servant.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And you see what it meant was this.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   That he had to lay aside the signs and the manifestations, the insignia, if you like,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   of his everlasting and eternal glory.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   If he had come as he really is in all the glory of the Godhead, no eye could have seen him.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   No man had seen God at any time, and no man could stand the sight.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   To see God would shrivel sinners to nothing.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   So he came in this form in which we could look at him and see him.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And enable him to say later on to a man like Philip,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Because he is the Son of the Father, and the express image of his person,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   the brightness of his glory, but it's veiled in flesh.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   It's veiled in flesh while he was here on earth, and it has to be.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Otherwise the sight, I say, would be too much for all mortal men, and especially men in sin.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   So this is what happens, this is what is involved.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   For God to be able to come down on earth to dwell amongst men,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   he has to come in this other form.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   But not only that, he had to make himself of no reputation,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   which means that he didn't come announcing who he was.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   He came to share life with men as men.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And so we read of him as being helpless, as I say,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   of growing in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and men.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   We read of him as a little boy.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   We read of him working as a carpenter, unknown and recognized.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Not worshipped, not adored, being buffeted by people,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   sharing all the vicissitudes of life.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   That's a part of it all.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   In order to come down to dwell amongst men,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   God to come down to dwell amongst men, it involved all that.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   He had to humble himself and make himself of no reputation in this way,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   and share the lot of ordinary men and women.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And that is exactly what he has done.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   So we are not only confronted by the fact itself,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   we are confronted by what it involved.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   This self-abnegation, this self-humbling,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   bringing himself down, as it were, to our level.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Asking John the Baptist to baptize him,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   identifying himself with us and with our sin.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Now, there is this glorious mystery.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   This is what happens all along.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   He is still God, but he is dwelling on earth as man with man,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   sharing temptations, tempted in all points,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   like as we are yet without sin,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   all that is involved in the story that we can read for ourselves
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   in the pages of the four Gospels.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Well, there it is. I leave it at that.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   I'm just giving you some thoughts to work out for yourselves
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   and to meditate upon at leisure.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   The fact and the marvel and the wonder of the fact
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   that God indeed has come down to dwell,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   and not in a great temple, but in the Virgin's womb,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   in the stable, in the manger, in the carpenter's shop,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   sharing ordinary life with ordinary men and women.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   But come, let me make another point.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   The purpose of the fact.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   What's the object? What's the purpose?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Well, that's where this Old Testament illustration is so helpful to us.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Why did they build their temple?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   What was the object and the purpose of the Shekinah glory?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Well, I've already answered the question by saying this.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   The whole object and purpose of the temple was
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   that it should be a place of worship.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   It should be a place where the people could meet,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   not only together, but to meet with God.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   They went there to meet with God.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   That's the object, that is the ultimate purpose.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   That they might have communion with him,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   and that they might pray to him,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   that they might confess their sins to him,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   and above all, that they might receive blessings from him.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Now that's the object.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Listen to it, let's put in verses 29 and 30 of this 8th chapter of the first book of Kings.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   "That thine eyes may be opened toward this house night and day,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   even toward the place of which thou hast said,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   'My name shall be there,'
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people Israel,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   when they shall pray toward this place.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   And hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   and when thou hearest, forgive."
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Now then, that is the ultimate object and purpose of it all.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   They made the temple for that reason.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   God came to meet them there.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   They went in knowing that they would meet him there at the mercy seat,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   over this ark and the cherubim,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   and the glory of God,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   a meeting place with God.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   What's the object of the incarnation?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Why did the Son of God ever come down on earth to dwell?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Why was Jesus ever born at Bethlehem?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   What's the object of this?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   What's the purpose?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Why did God send his only Son here into this world?
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And the answer, you see, is still the same.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   This is the object, that we might meet with God.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   This is stated abundantly in the New Testament.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Our Lord himself said it.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   It is only in him and through him that you can meet the Father."
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   The Apostle Peter, in writing his first epistle in chapter 3,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   verse 18, says exactly the same thing.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   He says that he died in order to bring us to God.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   The Apostle Paul is full of the same teaching.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Listen to him in Ephesians 2.18.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   "By him," he says, "by the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   we both, Jew and Gentile,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   by him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father."
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Now, here is the essential message of Christmas.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Our Lord didn't come into this world merely to give us a teaching.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   He didn't merely come to give us an example.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   There are so many people today who seem to think
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   that the sole message of Christmas is the message of pacifism.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   And I've no doubt many will be preaching about bombs and war
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   and things like that this morning,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   but the sole message of Christmas is pacifism.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   My dear friends, if you stop at that, you haven't begun to see the glory.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   No, no, he didn't come on earth merely to talk politics
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   or to give us general teaching, philosophic or social or anything else.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   He came and this was the one grand object and intention,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   to bring us to God.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Man is estranged from God.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Man by nature is under the wrath of God.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   That's why our world is as it is this morning.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   The wrath of God is upon it.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Has a world like this any right to ask God's blessing?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   It's sinned against him, it's spurned his commandments,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   it's broken them deliberately, it's God-hating.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   And yet it expects God to look down, smiling upon it and to bless it.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   It's impossible.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   The holy nature of God cannot do that, I say.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   God is holy and of such a pure countenance that he cannot even look upon sin.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Oh no, the great need of the world, the great need of every individual
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   is to know God, is to be brought to God,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   is to find some place where he can meet with God
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   and speak to him and pray to him and be blessed of him.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   And there's only one place in which it can be done.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Has God appointed that they should go and meet with him there
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   in that old temple that was built by Solomon?
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   And especially in the holiest of all?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   So he has done this.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   That was but a shadow, that was but an indication, that was but a type
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   just pointing forward to the coming of the Son of God himself.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   It is in him alone that we can meet with God.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Because something must be done about our sin.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And he alone can do it and he alone has done it.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   He was born to die.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   He was born to sacrifice himself for us and our sins.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   He was born for the suffering of death, that he might taste death for every man.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   He was born that he might be made the Lamb of God
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   And that's the only way whereby we can meet God.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   "Oh," says Job, "that I knew of some daysmen who could come between God and myself."
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Oh, that there were some daysmen?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And here is the daysmen.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   It is in Christ that man alone is able to meet with God
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and have communion with God
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   and bring his prayers and his supplications and his petitions to God.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Now, if you read the remainder of this eighth chapter of the first book of Kings,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   you will find that Solomon dealt with the whole thing in detail.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   He says, "Now we thy people are going to find ourselves in trouble."
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   So he says, "If any man trespass against his neighbor
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   and the oath come before thine altar in this house,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   then hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy servants,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   He lists the possible needs of men.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Here they are.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Men need protection.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Men need help in defeat.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Men need help when there is drought and when there is no rain
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   and when there is no food.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   He needs help in famine.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   He needs help in pestilence.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   He needs help when the mildew comes.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And then he's got a wonderful statement here in verse 38.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   "What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   or by all thy people Israel,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   which shall know every man the plague of his own heart
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   and spread forth his hands toward this house,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   the plague of his own heart."
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   That's what a man needs,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   not only when circumstances go against him,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   not only when there's war or pestilence or famine
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   or disease or defeat by enemies,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   oh, but when a man knows the plague of his own heart,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   when he realizes he's a sinner,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   when he knows he's vile,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   when he realizes that his nature is twisted and perverted and hopeless,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   where can he go?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   What can he do?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Men can't help him because they're the same.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Knowledge is inadequate because he can't put it into practice.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   He needs more.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   He needs God.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   How can he find Him?
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Here's the only place.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   It is in Christ.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   That's why he came, my friends,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   in order that we might be able to approach God
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   when we see the need of forgiveness,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   when we fall into sin and we can't forgive ourselves
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   and we don't know what to do.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   There's only one thing to do.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   It is to go to meet with God through this Christ.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Yes, He's dealt with the sin.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   He's borne its punishment.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   He's died for us.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   God has punished us in Him.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   We can meet with God and we can be given absolution.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   We are assured of forgiveness.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   We fly to Christ and there we know we meet with God
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   and we have forgiveness and pardon,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   new life, new nature, sustenance, blessing,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   everything we need.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And it's all in this blessed person.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   That's why God came down on earth to dwell with men.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   That's the answer to the problem and to the enigma.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Heaven, the heaven of heavens cannot contain this.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Yes, but He's been contained in the womb.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   He's been contained in a body of flesh.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Why?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   The answer is that you and I might meet with God
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   and receive those blessings that can come alone from Him.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Very well, that leads me to my last word, which is this.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   What is our response to this?
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   What should be our response to this?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Well, surely it's prefigured in this Old Testament.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   It should be amazement.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Will God indeed dwell on the earth in order that I may meet with Him?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Is it possible? Can it happen?
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Amazement.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Solomon was amazed that God should meet in the Shekinah glory
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   with His people in the temple.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   My dear friends, let's test ourselves in this chapel this morning.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Do you call yourself a Christian?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Well, if you do, this is the way that I can test your profession.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Are you filled with amazement this morning?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Is that your supreme feeling?
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Amazement at the fact that God has so loved you
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   that He has come down into the Virgin's womb
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   in order to meet with you.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Come to the cross, fixed, nailed to the cross, immovable,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   the One who created everything and who controls everything.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   He can't move. Nailed. Why?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Oh, that you and I might meet with God
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   and might know the forgiveness of sins
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   and might know that we are the children of God.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Amazement.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Are you amazed at it?
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   What else? Worship.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   I read here in the 14th verse,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   "And the king turned his face about
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   and blessed all the congregation of Israel."
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And then in brackets,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   "And all the congregation of Israel stood."
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   They stood in worship, in praise, and in adoration.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And it is the only adequate response to the message of Christmas.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Amazement, worship, adoration, praise, and above all, rejoicing.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   You remember the first people who went to see Him.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   They were the shepherds, weren't they?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   They had heard the news.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   The angelic host had given them the information.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   They said, "Let us go to Bethlehem
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   and see this extraordinary thing that has happened."
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And they came and they found Joseph and Mary
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   and the babe lying in the manger,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   everything exactly as it had been told them.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   And what happened?
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Oh, they worshipped Him.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And I am told that they went back to the fields
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   and to their sheep, rejoicing
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   that all the things which the angels had told them
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   had surely and truly come to pass.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Have we seen these things, my friends?
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Do we really understand them?
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   That's the way to test it.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   If you do, you'll be filled with amazement.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   You'll be filled with worship, adoration, praise,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   and you'll go out of this chapel rejoicing,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   rejoicing that God hath visited and redeemed His people,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   rejoicing that you know God is your Father,
