[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   All right, so what I want to talk about today is how to get organized in a world where all
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.300]   of the digital incoming, this email, the Slack, the digital meaning invites seem to be doing
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.400]   their best to drown you in obligations.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.200]   Now, this is a common topic on the show, but what's different, what I want to focus on
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:28.600]   right now that is different is what to do on the very first day on your journey from
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.000]   disorganized to organized.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   So it's the day one steps I want to focus on today.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.100]   My plan is I have five steps to go through.
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.940]   The first four steps are highly technical.
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.480]   What to do in the first four to six hours on the quest to become a more organized person.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.080]   The fifth step will then give you the maintenance activities to do for the 30 days to follow
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.680]   to make sure that everything you do this first day actually sticks.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.720]   So this is not about having the most advanced ongoing system, but instead taking the biggest
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.620]   possible steps on the very first day.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.560]   Before we get into those details, though, let's start by briefly discussing the psychological
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:20.000]   obstacle that we have to get past before we can hope to succeed in this quest to become
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.560]   more organized.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.040]   Here is what I think the main problem is that people have is a misperception about the reality
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.040]   of their workload.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.760]   So I'm actually, again, with great trepidation, going to draw a picture here for those who
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.320]   are watching instead of just listening.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   I want to draw a picture about how most people think about their workday.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.240]   This is just sort of implicitly in their mind.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.560]   So we have here a very happy stick figure, and he's sitting, I don't know, he's sitting
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.640]   at his desk, and there we go.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.760]   He's sitting here at his computer, expertly drawn.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.440]   So let's draw a little computer here.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   Perfect perspective.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.560]   All right, so there he is, happy at his computer.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.440]   Because in the world of the way most people just sort of imagine their work is, what's
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   going on?
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.400]   Well, there's maybe a couple phone messages to return.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.200]   I have three little phone messages over here, and there's two projects.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.240]   Let me choose one of these projects to make progress on, and there's a few phone messages
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   that you might want to return.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.240]   And in fact, our happy person here, I'm going to give them a notebook.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.880]   And in this notebook, with colored pencils, kind of have this nice little plan for the
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.880]   day.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.600]   Work on project A, and then return these calls, and go for a nice walk, and then take lunch.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.240]   This is sort of the implicit assumption people have about what their work life is like.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.600]   I have some stuff I'm working on, some things I have to get back to people.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   All right, what's the reality?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.160]   Well, I'm going to draw a picture of what I imagine, this is what I think the reality
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.880]   is for most people.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:13.520]   So what I have here is our same person, now very unhappy, running as fast as he or she
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.920]   can, because there is a giant cloud of an overwhelming quantity of projects, and requests,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.040]   and tasks, and things that people need from them.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:34.200]   And it's chasing him or her, I'm going to say, for whatever reason, it's shooting lightning
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.880]   bolts at this person.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.320]   Huge cloud chasing after the running person, there's lightning bolts.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.640]   For some reason, things are on fire, because I don't know, that's kind of what it feels
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.920]   like, so there's just flames everywhere.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.080]   This is the reality.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.760]   Most people think, "Oh, I use my color pencil, so that I can differentiate my phone call
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.360]   from when I work with a nice cup of tea on project A."
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.800]   Reality, running from fire as there's this giant swarm chases after you, firing lightning
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   bolts at you.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.960]   All right, why is it important that we have this misconception?
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.160]   It's because when you think, "It works not so bad," two things happen.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.360]   One, you don't think you really need to do much to get more organized.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.120]   Work is not that hard.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.080]   I just need to maybe draw out a to-do list in a nice format, be a little bit careful,
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.960]   or just buy, like I bought this nice-looking Japanese paper planner online, and we'll write
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.640]   it, and it's going to make our lives a little easier.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.680]   You don't see the urgency of actually taking major action.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.680]   The second issue that's generated by this misconception is that if you do begin wandering
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.480]   towards some more systematic organization, it's you open the door to this reality, and
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.400]   my God, it's so terrible that you just slam that door shut and say, "Let's just pretend
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   that doesn't exist."
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   Denial.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.720]   "I don't want to confront the reality of how much stuff is going on."
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.400]   Here's the thing, though, and this is the first step of the five steps I want to talk
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.920]   about today.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.080]   The very first step on your very first day of becoming organized is preparing yourself
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.760]   to face this reality.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.400]   So it is a psychological preparation step.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.360]   There is a term of art that I used to use in the early days of this show, and that was
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.360]   called "facing the productivity dragon."
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.400]   The idea behind facing the productivity dragon is that you confront the reality of everything
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.880]   that is on your plate, even if it is terrifying and overwhelming and shooting lightning bolts
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.120]   at you and lighting the world around you on fire.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.420]   It is better to confront the reality than to pretend it doesn't exist.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.240]   So step one is to prepare to face this productivity dragon.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.520]   Now this is not a new idea.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.120]   If we go back to the OG of digital age productivity, that is David Allen, he wrote about what was
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.540]   involved in trying to get your arms around for the first time, the step of getting started
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.540]   on being organized.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.720]   He wrote very clearly in his 2001 classic, Getting Things Done, how much is involved
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.640]   in taking that first step from chaos towards calm.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.800]   I'm going to read you from chapter five of his book here.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.400]   Here's a short excerpt.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   Just gathering a few more things than you currently have will probably create positive
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.800]   feelings for you.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.600]   But if you can hang in there and really do the whole collection process 100%, it will
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.520]   change your experience dramatically and give you an important new reference point for being
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.880]   on top of your work.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.440]   When I coach a client through this process, the collection phase usually takes between
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:45.040]   one and six hours, though it did once take all of 20 hours with one person.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.120]   All right, so what Allen is teaching us here is this very first step of confronting the
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.640]   productivity dragon takes time.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.760]   It takes hours because there is more in there than you probably want to admit.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.000]   So the concrete advice that comes out of this first step is that you need to put aside a
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.600]   full day for this day.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.160]   When I say, what do you do the first day of becoming more organized?
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.140]   I don't mean here's something you can do for 30 minutes in the morning and then you'll
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.320]   be more organized.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.680]   You actually are going to need a full day to do this right.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.840]   So you could take a put aside a day that was otherwise quiet or put aside a weekend day
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.600]   or a vacation day if you need to.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.080]   We have plenty of those coming up.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.640]   But you need to prepare yourself that you're going to need something like a full day to
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.160]   actually make the transition I'm going to talk about right now from chaos to calm.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.840]   All right, step two, let's get technical.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.140]   You need to set up your first storage system.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.780]   The place that is going to gather and make sense of all of these things that you actually
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.780]   have to do.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.360]   Now, if you go back and read David Allen, one of the things you're going to notice is
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:57.680]   that he relies a lot on a embodied physicality in the obligations in people's lives.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.800]   So he sort of imagines that many of the obligations in people's lives have a physical embodiment.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.520]   There's a receipt that has to be submitted.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.640]   There's a phone slip for a call that has to be returned.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.640]   There's a printed report that was given to you that you have to do your revisions on.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.320]   And so his process of collection from getting things done is all about having these physical
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.460]   inboxes, literal boxes.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.040]   And you're going around your space and collecting these artifacts and putting them into these
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.040]   inboxes.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.620]   You're building piles of your stuff.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.280]   And for the small number of things that don't actually exist in the real world, he says
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.360]   you write down a pointer to it and put that piece of paper in the physical box.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.720]   So it's a very physical process.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.800]   I'm going to suggest something different.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.440]   I think that the difference between the late 90s and early 2000s when Allen was putting
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.560]   together this methodology and now in the 2020s is that the vast majority of professional
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.840]   obligations in your life as a knowledge worker are digital.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.240]   Very few of them are embodied.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.600]   Maybe you printed something, but the thing you printed has a digital counterpart for
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.040]   which it began.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.080]   Most stuff is actually implicitly in an email somewhere.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.880]   It's a request that was in a slack.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.840]   It's a, it's a appointment that's lurking on your digital calendar for which work has
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.600]   to be done.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.720]   So to try to translate now that the vast majority of our obligations are digital, to try to
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.280]   somehow translate those into the physical world, the gathering back into the digital
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.380]   would be inefficient.
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.680]   So our storage systems is going to, we're going to start digital and we're going to
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.680]   remain digital.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   All right.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.200]   So no physical inboxes.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.800]   What is going to be the digital system in which we're going to store everything?
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.880]   It's going to require three things, a collection of lists, the ability to rapidly add, update,
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.480]   or move items between these lists, and the ability to efficiently append information
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.840]   such as links or notes or texts copied out of emails to individual items on these lists.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.560]   These are the three capabilities we're going to need in our storage system.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.120]   This clearly is going to have to be digital.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.640]   You're not going to be able to get all of those features in a purely analog system,
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.560]   the quickly moving things with back and forth, the pending information and things.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.960]   So we're going to need a digital system here that can satisfy those three things.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.140]   Hey, quick interruption.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:19.340]   If you want my free guide with my seven best ideas on how to cultivate the deep life, go
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:25.520]   to calnewport.com/ideas or click the link right below in the description.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.520]   This is a great way to take action on the type of things we talk about here on the show.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.520]   All right, let's get back to it.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.280]   I'm going to give you three options here from simple to most complex.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.320]   The simplest way to implement a system that has those three properties would just be with
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.020]   word processing or text files.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.200]   So just imagine you have a text file, you can just have a bold header for each of the
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.520]   lists that we're going to find, and then just write below it, separated by white space,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.040]   different items of the list.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   If you want to append information to an item in this particular implementation, you can
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.880]   just put a bullet point or a collection of bullet points under the item and just copy
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.160]   and paste whatever information you need.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.220]   It doesn't have to be neat.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.040]   So you could just get going with Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.400]   Any number of online task programs let you do this easily as well.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.360]   A favorite of mine is WorkFlowy.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.120]   All it is, is list that you can indent.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.040]   Press enter, you get another item, press tab, it indents over.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.200]   What's nice about this is you can hide indentations.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.560]   So if you have a bunch of things, extra information, there are tasks, you can click assign to have
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.560]   it all collapse, and then you can just open it again when you want that information.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.360]   So for our three properties, text files will be fine.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.920]   Next more complicated solution for implementing this system is going to be something like
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.840]   Trello.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.080]   This is what I use.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.980]   It's just very well set up for what we're talking about here.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.800]   Each list can be a column on a Trello board, each item can be a card on a Trello board,
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.880]   extra information can be appended to the back of the cards, and the cards are easy to move
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.660]   back and forth between different columns.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.160]   The more advanced solution would be to build something more custom, perhaps using a task
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.840]   view database system like Notion.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:14.520]   I would not start here for your very first day of becoming organized, unless you're already
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.920]   a pro at one of these systems, and it's as easy for you to put together as it is for
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.280]   someone else to set up WorkFlowy.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.480]   This is the type of thing you can think about down the line.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.240]   Once we've made this initial leap from chaos to control, chaos to calm, down the line,
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.760]   you might think about if you're more tech oriented, building a more advanced system,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.000]   but I wouldn't start there.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.200]   Okay, so we now know what a system broadly speaking needs these lists that you can update
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.240]   and move stuff behind between an append information.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.000]   We know what tech tools you can use to actually store these lists.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.620]   What are the actual lists we need in our initial system?
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.040]   I'm going to suggest six for your starter system.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.920]   Again, whether this is in Docs, Trello, or Notion.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:11.280]   Ready, Backburner, Waiting, To Discuss, Clarify, and Scheduled.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:17.640]   So in fact, I'll even write these on the screen so we can be on the same page.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:24.020]   I want to talk a little bit about each of these.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.580]   I always try to type on here, Jesse, but it always just creates, makes the world just
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.260]   fall apart.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.020]   By the way, see that issue with the trying to type on here?
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.980]   That's why I had to stop using this in my classroom.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.420]   When you're in projection or screen sharing mode, in Notability, the text does, the typing
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.420]   doesn't work very well.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.420]   All right, I can just write though.
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.420]   I got beautiful handwriting.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.780]   All right, so what are these things?
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.240]   Ready was number one.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.580]   What we mean by ready is going to be, think of it as like a ready for action.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.820]   These are things, items that need to be worked on as soon as we can get to them.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.780]   I typically think about something under a ready list as something that I want to try
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.260]   to complete in the given week.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260]   Different people do that slightly different ways.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.100]   Next we had Backburner.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.380]   These are things that they need to get done.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.300]   You've committed to them, but you're not working on them right now.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.980]   So we have them on the Backburner, so we're not going to forget about them.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.220]   We have a place, and here it is on this list.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.280]   If we get more information about this thing that we've committed to, but it's not coming
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.900]   up yet, we have a place to put that information.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.880]   Someone emails us more details about the workshop we've agreed to set up, and we're not really
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.060]   working on that yet.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.300]   We can copy that text from the email and put it on the back of this Trello card or an indentation
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.300]   under this item.
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.580]   So that's what's going on the Backburner.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.580]   Waiting, this is critical.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:47.500]   I think this is the most important type of list that people do not typically keep.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.020]   This is things that you are waiting to hear back about.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:54.260]   All right, so this is I'm working on this workshop.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.820]   I sent an email to the administrator about trying to get a room reservation.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.660]   I am waiting to hear back from that person about whether or not we can get that room.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.040]   That item can be now under the waiting list.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.340]   So it's waiting as in waiting to hear back.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:16.540]   Another critical list that most people don't use in their systems, but is very efficient
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.540]   is to discuss.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:23.100]   So it's where you keep track of things where I'm going to be meeting with this person or
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.540]   team at some point in the near future.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.380]   What do I want to discuss with them at that next meeting?
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.940]   Now you have two options here.
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.460]   You can just have one list to discuss and every item on it, the very first thing in
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.500]   the title of the item in bold is to discuss with Jesse.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.820]   So you can clarify for each item, who is this for?
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.420]   So it's for people or teams you meet with on a regular basis.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.700]   And the idea here is if you have things you need more information on, instead of just
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.800]   throwing an email into the ether, you can kind of collect lists of, okay, next time
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.000]   I talk to Jesse, I have four things on here to go through.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.540]   If there's people you have a lot of things to discuss things with and you talk to them
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.220]   on a regular basis, they can get their own to discuss list.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.740]   You might have multiple to discuss lists with team, with boss, with department chair.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.260]   That's fine as well.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.220]   Clarify these are placeholders.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.740]   All right.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.780]   I have this obligation, something I'm supposed to do something about this.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.460]   I don't yet know what that means.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:26.300]   In other words, like, I don't know what I should do right now to make progress on this
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.300]   thing.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.300]   I just know I'm committed to it.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.540]   I need to think through or learn more about what this actually means.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:36.500]   You know, I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll handle the secret Santa in the office this week or
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.500]   this month.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.740]   And I don't really know what that means.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.820]   Like, I don't know how that works or what I need to do, but I just committed to it.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.820]   I don't want to forget it.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.980]   It can go to the clarify list.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.660]   So that means this is an obligation that is pending more clarification on what it actually
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.940]   is going to require us to do.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:55.460]   So we have a place for it and then scheduled.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:02.360]   So if there's a non-simple task that is scheduled on your calendar, so it's a task that requires
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.220]   some explanation or maybe has some information that gets appended to it.
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.680]   Here's what people emailed me.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.820]   Here's the list of steps I need to do on this.
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.620]   I'm supposed to file this report.
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.500]   I put aside time to do this on Friday morning, but here's the step someone told me about
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.300]   how to do this or how to submit it.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.500]   This gives you a place for that item to live in your system.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.760]   So all that information can live somewhere.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:29.980]   So a item under scheduled is also on your calendar somewhere, but the item on your list
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.780]   can hold all the extra information you need.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.660]   Not everything on your calendar needs to be under the scheduled item.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.840]   You don't need appointments for the most part under there.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:43.580]   You don't need small things under there, you know, pick up whatever, someone from the train
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:48.860]   station, you know, you probably don't need an item there, but if it's complex, there's
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:54.300]   information you need to remember about it, then it can live there under the schedule
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.300]   item.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.700]   All right, so you have six lists and that's your initial collection system.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.180]   So we've set up six lists in some sort of digital system.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:08.000]   All right, step three, here's the face in the productivity dragon part made real, dump
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.980]   everything on your mind, in your inbox, in the world, everything that you are obligated
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.260]   to do gets on these lists.
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.820]   All right, so what does this mean?
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.820]   Everything you can think of.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.040]   So just start, like, what can I think of that I'm supposed to be working on or I should
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.420]   be doing?
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.420]   Maybe I told someone I would do it, or I've just been thinking to myself, this is something
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.820]   I should make progress on.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.740]   I should update the website.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:39.040]   Get everything you can out of your head, get it onto an item in these lists.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:44.460]   Go through your inbox and process every single email.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.780]   Get the inbox empty.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.020]   This doesn't mean reply to every email.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.860]   This doesn't mean take care of every email.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.600]   You're translating these emails into task items that go into your system.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.140]   So for this initial collection phase, you want to clear everything out of your inbox.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.260]   And it might mean you might have things showing up on your list.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:11.700]   It's just like reply to send Jesse the information he requested about skeleton manufacturing,
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.700]   right?
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.580]   Like just whatever it is, you're just translating emails and items on this list.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:22.260]   You're, you are denying your email inbox to be a secondary task management system at this
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.460]   point.
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.780]   You're putting all your faith into this collection system.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.060]   Look at your calendar, they're complicated things on there, reminders that should be
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.260]   translated into tasks that are on this list.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.620]   Then go back and think some more about what else am I forgetting?
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.560]   What else is just in my head?
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.780]   Let me give you a couple advanced tips for going through this collection process.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.900]   Number one, it does help sometimes to use a working memory dot txt file as an intermediary
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.400]   in this process.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.140]   So just have a plain unformatted text file on your computer.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:56.260]   As you're going through one of these categories, you can just dump things into that text file
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.140]   and then go from that text file into your system.
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.120]   It helps, right?
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.500]   It feels like this is an extra step, but it actually helps, especially if you're cleaning
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.700]   out an inbox because you can type really quickly into a text file and you don't have to be
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.040]   organized or really think it through like reply to Jesse about this, send back dates
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   to so and so.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.660]   You can just type really, really fast and just fill in this text file really fast.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.780]   I call it working memory dot txt because this text file is like an extension of your working
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.780]   memory.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.780]   Our brain can hold five or six things at a time with a working memory dot txt file.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.180]   You can have 20 or 30 things.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:35.100]   It's like you're extending your working memory and then you go from that text file into your
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.100]   system.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.060]   It takes a little bit more time to put things into your system.
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.500]   You have to choose the list, you have to create the card or do the font formatting if you're
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.580]   using something like Microsoft Word.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:51.500]   More importantly, as you go from this very fast to fill in plain text file to your system,
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.100]   you see things to consolidate or to simplify.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:59.860]   Actually, I don't really need to respond to these people or now that I look at this, I
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:05.340]   have eight different emails on here from Jesse about merchandising Jesse Skeleton.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:13.440]   I could just combine this into one item on my list, which is set up intervention to talk
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.960]   to Jesse about his obsession with Jesse Skeleton.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.220]   You actually get some on the fly organization and consolidation simplification as you go
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.340]   to this extended working memory and then into your system.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.060]   Advanced tip number two, when you're going through this initial dumping of everything
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:34.260]   in your life into this system, lean heavily into the clarify list.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.100]   Don't try to work everything out during this process.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.220]   There's too many things.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.020]   Don't try for everything you come up with like, well, what's going on with this project?
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:48.500]   Well, let me follow up with so and so about this and let me look at this a little bit
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.760]   of when might I be able to do this.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.820]   You don't have the time or energy to actually clarify all of the ambiguous obligations that
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.820]   are on your plate.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.280]   Right now, we're just trying to get everything into our system.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.500]   So at first, your clarify list might be really long.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.980]   You just don't want to forget it.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.340]   So you just have, you know, workshop plan.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.860]   God, I don't even know what that means, but I'm not forgetting it.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.940]   I'm just throw it in the clarify list for now.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.420]   We'll deal with this in the next step.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.660]   So don't worry about that.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.740]   The key role to maintain as you're initially populating your list in your system, and this
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.740]   is the rule that you should maintain going forward, is that every obligation gets one
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.140]   item in the system.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.500]   It can move between lists.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.240]   It cannot exist on multiple lists.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:37.340]   You do not have, okay, under ready, workshop, you know, next steps for this workshop project.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.860]   And then if that generates an email to an administrator, you don't keep that item under
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.620]   the ready list and add a new item to the waiting to hear back list.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.760]   You move that full item over to the ready, the waiting to hear back from list and just
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.380]   update the status up top.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.900]   I'm waiting to hear back from so-and-so about this.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:59.100]   All of the information about a given obligation lives in the system, but it moves around to
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.060]   what is the status of this obligation right now?
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:07.780]   So think about these lists as the statuses of various obligations.
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.740]   If you are actually building a notion-based system to keep track of this stuff, this would
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.380]   be a lot more explicit because it's, these are database entries that can have a single
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.420]   status.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.740]   It's here, then it's there, then it's here.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.380]   So everything just lives in one place.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.900]   All right.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.400]   This will take a while, one to three hours probably.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.380]   We've really spent a lot of our day here getting everything into this list.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.620]   But now symbolically, when you're done, everything is captured.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.420]   Your inbox is empty.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.780]   There's nothing in your head.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.020]   There's nothing just sitting there in your calendar.
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.020]   You don't know what it means.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.780]   It's all in this one place, this collection of lists, this system of yours.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:52.660]   That brings us to step four, to do your initial configuring.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.540]   Moving forward, configuration of your list, of your system is something you're going to
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.740]   do on a semi-regular basis.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.820]   We'll get to that soon, but we're going to do our very first configuration step during
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.060]   this very first day that you're making your leap from chaos to calm.
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.260]   This is a big thing that was always missing from David Allen's methodology, but I think
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.580]   is really important.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.900]   This is where you make sense of all of the things in your system and you clarify and
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.140]   optimize, remove redundancies.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:24.020]   It's where you sit and move and work around and make more sense of this huge mess of stuff
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.140]   that's on your plate.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.700]   This means a few things.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:32.300]   One, start going through your clarifying, the items under the clarify list and try to
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.500]   clarify as many as you can.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.580]   The stuff that's not particularly urgent, you can skip for now, but the things you think
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.180]   like, "I need to do something about this," now you can clarify it.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.580]   You don't want to clarify as you're filling in your list and doing your dumping everything
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.740]   in your life because that's too much friction.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.980]   But now that you've done that, now we can focus just on moving through this clarify
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.940]   list and say, "What are the things that really I should be making progress on?"
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.940]   And start doing the clarification.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.820]   Now, this might mean you discard it.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.660]   "I don't really need to do this."
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.380]   Or it might mean you're sending a clarification email.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.460]   This is often the case with stuff that ends up on clarifying when you go through a configuration
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.460]   step.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:14.420]   Often the reaction is, "I got to write this someone to say, 'What the hell does this mean?'"
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.180]   How do I set up the secret Santa?
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.700]   You did it last year.
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.700]   Can you tell me about it?
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.700]   That's fine.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.060]   You moved over to the waiting to hear back from list.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.700]   Other things that might be obvious, "Now that I think about it, what I need to do is
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.580]   set up a meeting with my team and we need to make a plan."
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:36.060]   So either I can send that doodle pool now to do that, or move this over to the ready
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:42.340]   list and change the actual description of the item to set up meeting with team to discuss
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.060]   this project and all the information about it is attached to this card.
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.980]   This is what I mean by clarify.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.940]   So it's moving things off of that clarify list to where they should go.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.900]   This is also a good time to triage.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.580]   Go through and triage the back burner.
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.700]   Do I really need to do this?
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.340]   I was excited about this, but I'm thinking now I don't need to do that.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.580]   So you can kind of go through like what's on the back burner.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.580]   Let me triage things out of this.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.500]   What do I really want to stick with?
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.500]   This is where you might send some sorry triage messages.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.580]   "Hey, sorry.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:19.140]   I know I said before I could help you with this, but actually I think my schedule is
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.140]   too crowded."
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.380]   That creates like seven seconds of annoyance on the recipient's end, but for the sender
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.060]   that email, it can create seven hours of freedom.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.300]   So those are very powerful.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.180]   Whenever I get those type of messages from someone, not right before something is due
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.060]   or after it's due, "Hey, I didn't do this.
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.940]   I can't really get to this," but like three weeks in advance, "Hey, you know how I said
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.020]   we should record this thing?
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.180]   Honestly, I was misreading my schedule.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.500]   This is probably not the right time for it."
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:49.780]   I know that someone who has their act together, that someone who's looking and configuring
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.380]   their whole schedule and seeing what makes sense and what doesn't, you'll actually earn
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.380]   respect if in advance you're stepping back from things.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.820]   Now, if you wait until it's due and just don't do it and then step back, that's a different
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.900]   thing when you look out of control.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.460]   Another part of configuring is adding things to calendars that need to be on calendars.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.620]   "Okay, this is pretty urgent.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.700]   Let me find time for this and get that on my calendar."
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.980]   If there's information associated with this task, I'll move this over to scheduled.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.980]   If it's a one-time thing like set up doc dentist appointment and I get it on my calendar, then
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.740]   I just delete the item from my list.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.240]   I don't need it there.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:26.660]   It's also a good time, and this is an advanced tip, to look for batching opportunities.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.580]   I have this, this, this, and this.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.700]   All of these things I could really make progress on if I talk to Jesse about them.
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.180]   So what I really want to do is take all of these five things and put them all on the
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:46.020]   back of my Trello card for the item of set up meeting with Jesse to discuss many things.
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.460]   And you kind of have these things below.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.860]   And then I send the email to Jesse saying, "Let's do this meeting."
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.180]   And that whole card gets moved to waiting to hear back from.
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.020]   Or I'm like, "Oh, we meet every week when we record our podcast.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:02.860]   Let me batch a bunch of these things and put it under the to discuss list, Jesse's to discuss
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.860]   list."
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.420]   So it's in this configuring step, you get all these great batching opportunities.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.660]   Let's wait to do this here.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.260]   Let's do all these things at the same time.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.100]   I'm going into work on Friday.
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.540]   And so let's put aside a big group of time and we're going to squash through 20 things
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.580]   that need to get done.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:24.300]   This is really productivity ninja stuff when you begin to do these batching opportunities.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.820]   Something that really doesn't happen when you're just reactive and chaotic.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.880]   "Oh my God, what do I need to do next?
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.880]   My inbox is on fire.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.300]   Oh my God, this thing is due."
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.500]   You're never going to see those type of opportunities.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.700]   All right.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.220]   So at this point, you have your system fully set up.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:42.220]   You're about four or five hours into your first day of trying to be more organized and
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:48.380]   you have everything in a intelligently designed digital system in the six optimal list.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.180]   And you've done your initial configuring.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.340]   So stuff that's important has been clarified.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.260]   You batch stuff, you remove stuff, you've moved things where it needs to go.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.260]   Some things are on the calendar.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.820]   So you kind of have your arms around what's on your plate.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:07.380]   The fifth and final step is how do we then make the use of this system stick?
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:12.980]   If you stop trusting this system, it will fall apart.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:18.000]   If you find yourself unwilling, for example, to move something out of your inbox and onto
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.940]   an item in these lists, that means you don't trust yourself for this system.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.940]   It means you say, "I know I'll check my inbox."
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.060]   Because I get yelled at if I don't.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.700]   I don't trust myself to look at this system.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.440]   So let me just keep this in here.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.260]   If you're writing notes to yourself, you're not trusting your system.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.100]   So how do we actually get you into the habit now of actually making this system part of
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.820]   your workflow?
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.380]   Well I'm going to suggest two things you do daily and one thing you do weekly for the
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.940]   next four weeks after this very first day of getting organized.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:51.060]   So the first daily thing, review this system every morning when you look at your calendar.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.340]   Use it to help make your plan for the day.
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.700]   I won't even get into now how you're making your plan for the day.
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.900]   This is more advanced stuff.
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:02.340]   But however you make your plan for the day, and again, the brightly colored pencils on
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.340]   your fancy planner or you're just jotting stuff down on a text file, I don't care.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:10.540]   For now, I look at my system every day before I make this plan.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.100]   I see what's on that ready list.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.420]   I remind myself who am I waiting to hear back from.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.780]   I remind myself on the to discuss list, "Hey, do I have a meeting coming up today that I
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.780]   need to discuss things on a to discuss list?"
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.940]   We're talking five minutes, but you see it all.
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.740]   You see the mess of stuff in Clarify that you haven't got to.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.540]   You see the big back burner.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.120]   You see everything.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.540]   Number two, at the end of every day, when you're finishing the shutting down your work,
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.740]   you have to go back and review the system again.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.860]   Here the goal is to make sure that anything that is floating gets nailed down back into
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:45.860]   the system.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.420]   "Oh yeah, you know, I said in this meeting I would do this.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.740]   Let me make sure that's written down in my system.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.940]   This thing came in, this request in a Slack.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.980]   Let me get that into my system."
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:03.220]   You're closing the loops, making sure that there's nothing just in your head.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.500]   Should you at this point empty everything in your inbox into your system like we did
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.700]   on the day one?
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.140]   It's probably not practical because it just is too time consuming.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.340]   You might not always have that time.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.900]   So let's put that aside for now.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:18.300]   But otherwise, anything else that's loose or urgent, you want it in your system.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.820]   You look at your system, make sure there's no obvious changes or updates to do.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.380]   Typically, if the day moves fast, there's updates you need to make to your system you
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.700]   haven't gotten around to.
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.500]   "Oh, I sent that email about this.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.380]   I need to move that over to waiting to hear back.
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.420]   Or I heard back from this thing.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.100]   So I need to move this back from waiting to hear back to over here and then copying what
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.100]   I heard about it."
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.260]   So just do that final cleanup so your system, everything is back in it and the system is
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.740]   up to date.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.520]   Do that every day, first four weeks.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.300]   The weekly thing I want you to do for the first four weeks is return to that step four
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:55.100]   configure step at the beginning of each week for the next four weeks.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.220]   You can do it Monday morning, you can do it Sunday.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:01.300]   Some people do it at the end of the day, Friday, so they can go into their weekend, less stressed.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.220]   I don't care when you do it, but go back and do something like that configure step, which
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.460]   remember, it means you're going to the clarify items and trying to like, "Okay, which ones
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.180]   can I actually make progress on?"
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.400]   You're triaging, you're batching, you're moving things, your calendar are off.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.700]   This is like a 30 minute process of just getting the system fully up to speed.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.620]   Critically, when you do that configure process, this is a time to return to your inbox and
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.620]   empty it.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.260]   That's why it's good to do on the weekend or before the week really gets going.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.780]   The stuff that's piled up to my inbox that I didn't really have time during the days
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.140]   or my daily reviews to get to, I want to get that back down to zero and everything back
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.140]   into my system.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:41.420]   So it's a more thorough configuring than what you're doing at the end of each day.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.260]   Do this thing, you're going to be much more organized and you're going to be ready for
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.460]   the much more advanced ways we talk about of maintaining depth in a world of these increasing
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.780]   digital distractions in the workplace.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.700]   There's all the more advanced stuff we talk about.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.380]   This will give you the foundation.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.140]   Those first four steps will take you two to four hours.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.340]   You put aside a day to do this.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.860]   You'll be exhausted after this, not want to do much else work, but that is worth it.
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:08.220]   Two to four hours, you have a fully set up and configured task collection system.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.140]   That's a huge difference.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:14.740]   And then do the twice daily, once weekly routine for four weeks and your use of this system
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.980]   is going to stick.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.520]   That alone, even if you do nothing else in my advice and have completely idiosyncratic
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.300]   ways of planning your day or doing long-term planning or anything else, or how you do your
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.860]   email communication, all the other stuff we talk about, even if you ignore everything
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:31.420]   else I say, this will be a night and day difference.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.020]   You will no longer feel like there is this cloud of ambiguous, overwhelming obligations
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.860]   chasing you and shooting lightning bolts at your head.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.700]   You will say, I've got this.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:46.300]   And even if what you've got is difficult and impossible and you're completely overloaded,
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.900]   you're facing the productivity dragon, you know exactly how overloaded you are.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.100]   You know, what is the very best thing I can do given my circumstance?
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.700]   I can't get this all done.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.480]   Something's going to have to change until then though.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.600]   What can I, what's the best I can do with my time?
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.600]   It gives you confidence.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:05.260]   It gives you a sense of efficacy and it can really reduce that sense of stress that comes
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.260]   from my God.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.860]   I know I'm forgetting things.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.900]   So there's my five steps.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.460]   It's not going to make you the most organized person in the world, but it's going to make
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.460]   you more organized than 99% of the people who work in this world.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:20.220]   So it's a great place to get started.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:24.140]   Do you have those six lists in every board in Trello?
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.620]   So that's a more advanced tip.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:32.780]   So as you get more advanced in the system, what you then do is clone the six list system
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.500]   for the different roles in your life.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.460]   So we've talked about this on the show.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:43.740]   Sometimes I have different roles in my life, writer, researcher, teacher, professor, media
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:44.740]   company related.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.580]   Each of those has its own board.
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.440]   All six of those lists are in each board.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.580]   So that's one of the more advanced things you can get to.
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.540]   And there, if you have multiple roles, like so many of us in complex jobs do, you can
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.020]   just deal contextually with one role at a time and not mix together tasks from different
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.020]   things.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.220]   Like I don't want to think about Jesse Skeleton at the same time that I'm thinking about
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:10.180]   grading, get my grading post for my discrete mathematics class.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.900]   So sort of having those worlds separate is one of these advanced tips you can get to.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.140]   But just start with the six list.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.140]   All right.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.140]   So there we go.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.140]   Nitty gritty.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.740]   I like to balance the big picture with the nitty gritty.
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:29.020]   We got now some practical questions to get to about these type of ideas and how you put
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.440]   them in practice in real people's lives.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.780]   But first let's hear from our sponsors.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:39.180]   I want to start with our longtime friends at Hinson Shaving.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.580]   This is the razor that I use.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.820]   Here's what I like about Hinson Shaving.
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:51.020]   It is a family owned aerospace parts manufacturer that uses the equipment they have that can
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:58.340]   do incredibly precise milling of metals to make these fantastic precisely milled metal
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.180]   razors.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:07.300]   The Hinson razor, which is made on their aerospace grade CNC machines, allows the blade to extend
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:13.940]   just .0013 inches past the edge of the blade body that's housing it.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.620]   That's less than the thickness of a human hair.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:19.020]   That means the blade is secure and stable and you don't get that up and down diving
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.660]   board effect that causes clogs and nicks.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:26.500]   Now what I like about this is not just that a Hinson shaver is a beautiful object.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:31.260]   It's in a sort of, I think it's aluminum and it's milled in a really aesthetically appealing
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.860]   sort of shiny way.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.460]   It's cost effective.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.460]   Here is how this works.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.580]   You pay more up front for this really nice artifact, this tool, but because it's so precisely
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:47.060]   manufactured you can use it with very cheap 10 cent safety razor blades.
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:52.220]   And so over time this becomes much cheaper to operate than buying the expensive blades
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:56.580]   at the drugstore or joining one of the subscription services.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.820]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:07.760]   Visit hinsonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use the code CAL to get two years
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.120]   worth of blades for free with your razor.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:14.140]   Just add the blades to your cart and when you check out use that code CAL and the cost
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.360]   of the blades will drop to zero.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:24.700]   That's 100 free blades when you head to h e n s o n s h a v i n g.com/cal and make sure
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.700]   you use that code CAL.
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:35.700]   I also want to talk about our longtime friends and oh so easy to pronounce Zocdoc.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:40.980]   Zocdoc is a free app where you can find amazing doctors and book appointments online.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.540]   We're talking about booking appointments with thousands of top rated patient review doctors
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.740]   and specialists.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:50.220]   You can filter specifically for ones who take your insurance, are located near you, and
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:55.160]   treat almost any condition that you are searching for.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.980]   This is a service that makes so much sense that I don't know how we dealt with medical
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.540]   care before this.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.040]   Look here's the scenario.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.280]   You need a doctor for something that you don't already have an existing doctor for.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.600]   How do you find that?
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.540]   Before Zocdoc came along you were just randomly asking friends and they would recommend someone
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.020]   and that person would be completely booked and you would look up something randomly on
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:23.740]   Google and they would take you but they don't take your insurance or it turns out that they
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:28.060]   use some sort of weird methodology involving leeches and needles and it wasn't what you
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.980]   thought it was going to be.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.980]   Zocdoc solves all that problem.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:38.260]   You say let me search for this type of specialist in my area, takes my insurance, is looking
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.260]   for new patients.
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.700]   Oh here's one.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.300]   And I can read reviews from other Zocdoc users.
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.020]   Is this someone good?
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:50.360]   It simplifies the task of getting medical care.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:55.060]   It simplifies that task and makes it much easier.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.260]   A lot of times you can even then book your appointment right there from the app.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.340]   A lot of times you can then do, this is what my dentist does this, the pre-appointment
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.060]   paperwork using the Zocdoc service.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.140]   So it's all there ahead of time.
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.140]   You're quicker when you get there.
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:12.180]   It really just makes medical care so much easier to find and get moving with.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:16.740]   So go to Zocdoc.com/deep and download the Zocdoc app for free and find a book, a top
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.220]   rated doctor today.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.220]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.220]   Zocdoc.com/deep.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:28.100]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.100]   Sounds good.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.260]   Who we got first?
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.860]   First question's from William.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:37.500]   I find it much more feasible and fulfilling to create and stick to a plan for my personal
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.900]   life than my job.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:43.180]   I love working towards these daily and big picture goals as they seem to give me purpose.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:47.100]   I do love the company that I work for and feel that engineering is a good fit for me.
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.900]   So how can I make my career a more important part of my life?
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:56.320]   Well, William, there's three things I'm going to suggest because you're heading down from
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.380]   a psychological perspective, a somewhat dangerous road.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:06.780]   This idea of my work is not what I'm excited about, these other things are.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:12.900]   That can really lead you to despair or job hopping or radical changes that are not well
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:13.900]   justified.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.340]   Well, why don't I just make canoes full time as my job?
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.340]   I don't need to be an engineer.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.540]   And then you realize that for the most part, people don't want to buy canoes.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.460]   So I have three things to suggest for you.
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:29.060]   One, and this is not going to surprise longtime listeners, lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:33.160]   So when your job, what you're doing in your job, and more importantly, what you're trying
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:39.100]   to get to in your job is part of a vision of a lifestyle that resonates with you, you're
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:44.860]   excited about and feel really strongly about, your motivation for what you're doing professionally
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.100]   raises because it's not just an arbitrary thing.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.100]   I just have this job.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.540]   It's no, no, here's what I'm doing.
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.780]   I work at this engineering firm.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:56.020]   This income is part of this larger vision we have for our lifestyle.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.100]   And I have goals for what I'm trying to do professionally.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:03.660]   I want to actually move over to this type of work within engineering.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:09.700]   And once I master this, then move to contract basis, which will allow us to move over to
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.660]   this small town in Cape Cod, which is actually part of this bigger lifestyle vision we have
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:19.180]   of sort of living in Truro in the pine forest and working remotely and living cheaply.
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.820]   And we have this whole plan.
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.220]   And my work is building us towards that in a very concrete, tangible way.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.740]   Now you're going to be motivated about work.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.620]   Because your episodic future thinking center of your brain is saying, yes, this is leading
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:35.100]   us towards this bigger vision that we have really inculcated in ourselves, psychologically
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.020]   speaking as being highly resonant.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:42.580]   So you need to have that bigger plan and see how work fits into it.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:47.500]   I think a lot in this case, when I think about these examples, I think a lot about Mike Rowe
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:52.380]   from that old Discovery Channel job that showed dirty jobs where he went and spent time with
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:55.620]   people doing "dirty jobs."
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:03.460]   So these were more not knowledge work jobs, but more manual jobs, manual but non-knowledge
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.460]   work.
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.260]   So, you know, septic tank cleaners or roadkill picker uppers.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.780]   And he gave this great talk.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.860]   It's a TEDx talk.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.660]   This was from years back.
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:20.060]   And he gave this great talk about the people he profiled on dirty jobs.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.700]   And he said about him, a lot of these people are very happy.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:28.020]   He said, you know, I knew a roadkill picker upper who would whistle on his way to work.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:33.860]   He knew multiple, he had spent time with multiple septic tank cleaners who are incredibly fulfilled.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:34.860]   And why was this?
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.340]   It's because they own their own business.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.340]   They were making good money.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.020]   They had their arms around their finances.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.300]   This was supporting their family.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.660]   They had a nice house by the lake.
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:49.900]   They were, they had a vision of their lifestyle and how they fit into their family, their
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.860]   community life, that this work and this business they created was part of.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:58.260]   The content, and this was his big point, the content of the work is not what's important.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.460]   It is the role of the work in their lifestyle, the role of their work in the life that they
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.660]   think is worth living.
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.060]   When what you're doing fits with that, it can be incredibly fulfilling.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:12.780]   It is much more of a recent conceit, a conceit, conceit.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:13.780]   Talk to the Jesse.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.020]   I thought I was going to look that word up.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.020]   More recent conceit.
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.460]   Well, you always use a lot of like, a lot of vocabulary.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.860]   So I'm always like looking stuff up.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:23.860]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.860]   In this case, I'm just mispronouncing things.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:30.780]   It's a more recent conceit that the content of your job really matters.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:31.780]   This really emerged.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.140]   I mean, I wrote a whole book about this.
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.140]   So good they can't ignore you.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.620]   It came out in 2012.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.180]   This really emerges in the 1990s with the whole follow your passion movement.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.420]   It's not a timeless movement.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:45.660]   It's a movement that arises in the 1990s that suddenly puts a lot more emphasis on the content
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.780]   of your work.
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:50.940]   The content of your work matching intrinsic passion is the source of happiness.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.660]   This was the idea here.
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.140]   And Mike Rowe was saying that's nonsense.
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.020]   The content of your work is often not important.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:00.180]   It's not that I like the physical act of cleaning the septic tank, but I like running my own
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.620]   business and the flexibility and the money and the respectability and the ability to
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.220]   support myself and my family.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.340]   And I like the people I work for.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:12.700]   So lifestyle-centric career planning gets you away from just, do I like the specific
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.300]   task I'm doing today in my job?
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.340]   Because there be dragons.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.380]   That's not anywhere good.
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.180]   Number two, you need to connect more with the people you work with, connect more with
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.460]   the mission of the company.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.460]   Extroverts tend to be happier in their jobs.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:29.740]   They're really into the life of the different people they work around.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:34.120]   Those of us who are introverts have to do this work systematically.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.120]   My dad was an extrovert.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.420]   So when I would go to his office, he knew the life story of every single person who
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.860]   worked for him and was legitimately interested into it.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:46.180]   That makes a big difference in your experience of work when you're really connected to all
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.420]   the people around you and what's going on.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.660]   Us introverts have to make that effort, especially now in the era of these higher level jobs
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:57.940]   give you huge autonomy in terms of when you want to come in or not.
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.100]   And it's possible to barely come into your office.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:04.540]   You can completely isolate yourself from other people and you have to fight that systematically.
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.940]   I'm going to go into the office.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.220]   I'm going to talk to multiple people.
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.180]   I'm going to put time in my schedule, get lunches with people.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.420]   It really changes your relationship to your work.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:16.620]   I mean, I can feel this difference even in my own life.
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:24.660]   The sort of pre-pandemic, there's an era where I was going to Georgetown five days a week.
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:28.060]   I just would go every day like a normal job because I don't want to be at home.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.220]   When we had young kids, we had a nanny and I was like, I don't want to be home with the
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.220]   nanny.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.700]   I just went in every day and I was like, let me commute.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:35.700]   And this is what I did.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.540]   And compare it to like now post-pandemic where now I'm coming in more, but there was definitely
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.500]   a period where it was like people just weren't coming in that you're coming in to teach.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.500]   That was kind of it.
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.500]   It's a huge difference.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:49.780]   I have all these nostalgic memories of that earlier time at Georgetown where I was not
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.660]   just connected to the people there, connected to the campus.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:58.380]   Just I knew, hey, they decorate the courtyard behind Healy.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:02.940]   This is when like the Christmas decorations go up and here's the view of the river, just
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.020]   walking the campus and working in different libraries.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:12.100]   And it had a real strong connection to place that in say 2021, I didn't feel because it
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:14.020]   was almost, you know, how elite universities were.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.900]   They're almost apologetic about being open.
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.140]   And it was like, you don't even want to be here.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.140]   And just was very different.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:20.260]   It was very transactional.
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:24.980]   And now we're coming in much more and it's, it feels a lot better again.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.020]   So these things make a difference.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.700]   Three, get organized.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:33.300]   So the stuff we talked about at the deep dive of this episode also makes a difference.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.080]   When you have your arm around work, you feel efficacious.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.420]   When you feel efficacious, you actually feel more motivation and satisfaction about your
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.520]   work.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.980]   Having your act together makes work more enjoyable.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.380]   Not having your act together makes it seem like an impossible intrusion.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.380]   You kind of hold other people responsible for why is everyone bothering me?
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.020]   I'm too busy.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.380]   And it is a negative force in your life.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.700]   Whereas if you act together, like, man, I'm on top of this, it becomes a positive force
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.700]   in your life.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.660]   So I think that's kind of that key word out of motivational psychology, efficacy, sense
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.180]   of being effective and actually making progress towards your goals.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.820]   You feel efficacious, you feel much better, more motivated.
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.340]   Being organized makes you feel more efficacious.
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.860]   All right, William.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.660]   So let's get hardcore about lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.300]   Let's start connecting to our work and the people who work, who are there and the mission,
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.120]   like get more involved in the company.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.860]   And let's get your act together organizationally.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.380]   I think all of that is going to help you feel more motivated to do your actual work.
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.860]   All right, who do we got next, Jesse?
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:37.860]   Next question is from Esteban.
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:43.540]   I've been struggling with the Z garnic effect in college due to group work projects.
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:47.300]   I'm a software engineering student and it is common that almost everyone leaves everything
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.540]   to the last minute.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.100]   I've tried to tell my friends about time management, but they don't seem to hear me and I always
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.660]   have to correct what they did.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:57.960]   The situation takes up incredible amounts of time that I could spend doing other things
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.160]   more valuable to me.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.820]   How can I solve this problem?
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.860]   Oh, Esteban, I feel your pain.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.900]   Welcome to my, welcome to my college experience.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:13.140]   Imagine this, that the guy, the kid who was writing books about time management and being
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:17.100]   organized in college while still in college.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:21.920]   Imagine how I felt whenever group projects came along.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:27.380]   College students are terrible at being students.
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:33.460]   If people worked in other jobs the way that college students worked at their jobs, we
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:36.540]   would be living in a Mad Max hellscape.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:41.100]   The power system would shut down, animals would be running wild.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.940]   College students are very terrible at being college students.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:48.220]   Now this has been to my advantage in two ways, if I can digress into my own stuff.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.220]   I'll come back to you, Esteban.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.980]   But in two ways, this was to my advantage.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:55.980]   Number one, by being someone who was not really, really bad at being a student, I could really
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:56.980]   dominate.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:01.740]   Because you don't have to be brilliant, you just have to be like, in the world of work,
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.500]   what you would be considered to be a generally organized person.
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:11.540]   In the context of college, you're Thor, you're Wonder Woman.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:16.460]   It's like, my God, this is someone who can move things with their mind.
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.300]   When I got more organized over the summer between my freshman and sophomore year, I
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:25.860]   went from mixed grades to 4.0 every quarter, except for one quarter I got A-.
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.860]   It makes such a big difference.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:31.500]   It was also to my advantage because I've sold hundreds of thousands of copies of books
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.580]   to students about how to be more organized because it makes such a big difference.
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.940]   So I feel your pain.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:41.220]   I hated group projects too because college students are terrible at doing work.
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.500]   You kind of have to grin and bear it.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.420]   You get away from group projects when you can.
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:51.340]   If you're looking for groups informally, like to help you work on your problem sets,
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.100]   be incredibly selective.
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:55.540]   This happened at college.
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.460]   I actually heard from this guy a couple of years ago.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.660]   He heard me somewhere and was like, "Hey, do you remember me from college?"
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.340]   I was a pretty good computer science student, as you might imagine.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.460]   MIT, went on to do all this other stuff.
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.420]   I was a pretty good computer science student.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.340]   There was one kid that I could do problem sets with that was useful.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.940]   I found the one guy.
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.020]   We worked on our algorithms problem sets together.
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.620]   We worked on our theory of computation problem sets together.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.500]   We could keep up with each other and it was useful.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.140]   I realized, be in no other groups because it just wasn't that useful.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.940]   You got to find the people that you should actually work with.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.820]   When you're stuck doing group projects, it just kind of sucks, but also it's college.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:35.820]   What do you do?
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:40.020]   You try to set things up so that the work is kind of clearly set up.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:45.140]   Give yourself the work, even if it's more work, that you can get it done ahead of time
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.660]   and not have much to do.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:51.460]   Then finally, you got to stay up the day before projects are due.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.500]   This is just college life.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.300]   It's like fraternity hazing.
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.100]   We're going to stay up late to work on this thing.
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:51:00.420]   We could have got this done before, but just assume that's what's going to happen.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:05.700]   Trust me, as you get older, the standards for organization go up and things will get
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:06.700]   somewhat easier.
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:09.180]   >> Yeah, you never would have done a problem set with me.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.380]   I always had to track down.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:16.940]   I had this one guy that I would use for the first couple of years and he pretty much dumped
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:17.940]   me.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:18.940]   Then I had to find a new one for the software.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:22.580]   >> He dumped you because you were too lazy or because you were too smart?
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.980]   >> No, I wasn't too smart.
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:24.980]   He was really smart.
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.540]   I just needed help with a lot of stuff.
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:31.900]   >> You got to find someone who's right at your level.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.980]   Then you're pushing each other a little bit.
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:35.980]   And that are willing.
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:36.980]   For me, it was the organization.
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:42.260]   They're willing to, I'm saying, I know this problem set is due on Friday, but in my autopilot
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.020]   schedule Tuesday afternoon is the right time to work on this.
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.260]   They're willing and able to say, "I'll work on this Tuesday afternoon."
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.060]   Some people just can't do that.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.060]   >> I was good about maybe doing that.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.700]   So I helped to a certain degree.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:56.660]   And I needed to see them work through some of the problems so I could do them.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:57.660]   And then.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:02.580]   >> So here's my just outright brag.
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.260]   And I loved working with this guy.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.260]   And he wrote me a few years ago.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.100]   It was like, "Hey, remember we used to work together."
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.540]   >> Yeah, you mentioned him in the show before.
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:12.620]   And his thing was, it was something like working with you on those problem sets.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.700]   It was something like, whatever.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.700]   It was very complimentary.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.500]   That's why I realized maybe he was like, "I'm not going to go to grad school."
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:24.020]   Or whatever it was, like, "I thought I was really smart on this stuff and then working
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.020]   with you."
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.380]   So it was like some big compliment of like, he should have told me that at the time because
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.460]   it would have gave me more confidence.
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.800]   But anyways, I thought he was very smart because.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.780]   >> But then it's pretty wild because then when he went to MIT, you're like, "Oh my God,
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:36.780]   I'm in a different game."
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:37.780]   Right?
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:38.780]   >> They're so good.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:39.780]   >> I know.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:40.780]   >> They're so good.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.780]   Now I will say I aced MIT.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.500]   So from a class perspective, I did ace MIT and I did pretty well.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.500]   But man, there was people there that were beast.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:51.900]   >> The beast at MIT, especially among the faculty.
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.100]   Faculty in particular, but there are just some real beast.
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.100]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:53:00.860]   So it's, I mean, I see it completely like you're playing high school ball.
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.860]   >> Yeah.
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:02.860]   I was just, I was thinking about like a draft pick.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:04.900]   I was like, you're around all in like top 10 draft picks.
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:06.140]   >> You're playing high school ball.
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.020]   You're like, "I'm, this is, come on, I'm dominating these games."
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.100]   Like basketball or football is not so bad.
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.100]   You're playing football.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.420]   You're like, "It's not so bad.
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:14.420]   I like this.
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.420]   I like this game."
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:18.580]   And then, you know, Alabama recruits you.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:23.380]   And you're like, "These guys are 350 pounds and they can jump over me.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:24.780]   Like what the hell is going on?"
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:25.780]   Right?
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.100]   It's like a completely different, it's a completely different game.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:32.620]   And then like a few people percolate up to be the stars in that game and, you know, become
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:33.620]   famous.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:38.100]   And it was like, I'm the guy who got drafted, got picked at Alabama, but did not go on to
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.980]   be the star NFL quarterback.
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:41.340]   That's like the way, the way I see it.
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.300]   There's always like a level up.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.300]   Always a level up.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.300]   All right.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.460]   Enough, enough, humble bragging without the humbleness.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:49.460]   Let's move on.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.460]   What's the next question?
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.460]   All right.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:52.460]   Next question is from Felipe.
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.060]   How should I organize my deep work time?
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.420]   Should I spread a big task over four days for one hour each day versus blocking off
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.740]   a four hour block on a single day?
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:07.740]   Ooh, Jesse, I'm going to consider this our slow productivity corner.
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:12.660]   We get some sound effects, please.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.660]   Beautiful and professional.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.660]   I love it.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:19.180]   So as, as listeners know, in honor of or in celebration of my book, Slow Productivity
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:23.100]   that's coming out in March, in every episode, I like to have one question that is somewhat
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:25.140]   related to concepts of slow productivity.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.620]   We call it the slow productivity corner.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:32.260]   I'm going to count Felipe's question as today's slow productivity corner because he's talking
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:37.100]   about should I spread out deep work?
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:42.980]   What seems to be relevant to principle two of slow productivity, which is work at a natural
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:48.740]   pace, ups and downs of intensity, taking more time, et cetera.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.140]   Now this is a reverse a roo, if I can use the technical term here, because what we're
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:57.820]   seeing is something that seems like a good example of this idea of working at a natural
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:02.420]   pace, but is actually organizational foos gold.
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:03.740]   There is a trap here.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:09.780]   It is a, uh, an artificial slowing down that I think actually makes things worse.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.000]   So let me explain.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.820]   So in Felipe's case, I would say work one four hour block.
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:20.700]   Don't spread that out over four one hour blocks.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:21.700]   Now why is that right?
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:25.340]   If I'm, if, if the slow productivity mindset says be more, let's chill out and be more
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.380]   natural at our pace.
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:27.380]   Why is that?
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:30.900]   Well, because when we get to the details of this type of artificial slowing, what we have
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:34.760]   to account for is the cost of overhead.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.220]   So when I look at my time block planner and I say, I'm about to do one hour of work on
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:44.220]   this larger project, I don't just flick a switch and now I am all in on that project.
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.300]   And over the next 60 minutes, I get 60 minutes of intense work done.
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:48.540]   No, there's huge overhead.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:49.540]   All right.
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:50.540]   What am I working on now?
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:53.260]   I got to clear out of my head what I was working on before.
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:57.740]   I got to bring in the context of what's happening here and remember all the different things.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:01.540]   And where was I when I was last working on this, then I have to build up that intellectual
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:06.500]   head of steam where you sort of get that intellectual momentum and your mind is focusing in more.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.740]   You get those first initial results, which gets your motivational system going, which
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:13.460]   allows you to actually capture more energy into your cognition.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:18.620]   And you get that head of steam going and now you're working all cylinders, but you're 30
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.780]   minutes into your block.
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.820]   So then you end up getting about 30 minutes of all high cylinder work and then you're
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:26.560]   done.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:30.740]   So when you spread this work out over four sessions, you're paying that overhead cost
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.080]   on each of these sessions.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.460]   You're not getting four deep hours of work out of those four sessions.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:40.360]   It maybe is going to take six sections to get that same amount of work done.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.680]   Not only does it take longer, because again, slow productivity is not about just winning
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:47.240]   the game of in the end, how many total minutes were required.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.040]   Those are worse minutes.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:53.860]   It's like the ratio of sort of, I'm not in the zone to time I am in the zone.
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.920]   That ratio is not very good on the project.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.720]   And that's just mentally more difficult and taxing.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:05.040]   You do the four hour block, okay, 30 minutes into it, you're going full cylinders.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.680]   And then you get three and a half hours at full speed, you can start to do some damage,
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:12.760]   especially if this is really creative or interesting type of work.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:17.160]   So this notion of sort of slowing down and working at a natural pace scale really matters
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:18.160]   here.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:21.400]   So we are talking about like a particular chunk of work, just getting after that chunk
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.520]   of work might be the right thing to do.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:27.720]   If you're talking about at a bigger scale, many, many chunks of work.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:31.720]   So the difference between I want to finish a draft of this book chapter, and I want to
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.840]   write this book.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.080]   Now you want that pacing to be more natural.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:39.440]   Now you don't want it's just every day, six hours for six weeks, we're going to write
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:43.280]   this book, it's like now spend the year to write the book and, and work on it and then
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.000]   take breaks and come back to it and let that let that be more natural in the pacing.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.680]   So the idea of natural pacing works at a bigger scale, when you get to the small scale, you
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.480]   have to be careful about these nitty gritty details, like the overhead involved, like
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.080]   the cognitive reality of working on specific things.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.280]   So Felipe, that is our slow productivity corner of the day.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:06.960]   I appreciate the question, because it allowed us to talk about this common trap when it
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.880]   comes to work pacing.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.320]   We still need our music, Jesse.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.440]   I was just thinking that I got to get the music.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.440]   We need slow productivity.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:15.440]   People have been sending in suggestions.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.840]   Oh, they Oh, can you send me?
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.240]   I should people have been emailing not songs, just suggestions for like what the music should
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.240]   be like.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.760]   Okay, so no mp3.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.760]   No mp3s.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.280]   Send if you have an mp3, by the way, you think we should use as our slow productivity corner
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.000]   of the theme music, send that to Jesse at calnewport.com.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.080]   Yeah, just make sure it's like, you know, five seconds.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.720]   Yeah, but you do not send a well, but slow.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:41.400]   So we should have like, three minute song, a Brahms concerto.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   It takes 17 minutes.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.400]   Let's keep rolling.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:47.760]   What do we got next?
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.680]   Next question is from Martin.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.720]   Currently I'm enrolled in a part time online program and due to various issues, I do not
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.600]   know yet if I'll be continuing with the program during the next semester.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.280]   Consequently, my quarterly plan is somewhat open ended.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.280]   How do you structure your plans to accommodate such situations?
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.600]   Well, Martin, write two plans.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:13.360]   One that makes sense if you end up continuing with this online education program the next
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:20.400]   semester and one plan for if you do not, and then you can just switch to whatever one fits.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.480]   So I wouldn't overthink it two plans and switches needed.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.480]   All right, let's roll.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:26.640]   What do we got, Jesse?
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.480]   Next question is from Tracy.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.880]   I'd love to know where the book where your book reading fits in your day.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:32.880]   Is it time blocked?
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:36.840]   Or do you just keep a book near you at all times when you get some free time?
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:41.760]   I have an ever increasing list of books I'd like to read, including now the ones that
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:42.760]   you just mentioned.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.840]   It's a good question, Tracy.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:48.840]   I don't time block reading for the most part because I'm doing my reading outside of my
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:52.800]   work day and I don't time block my time outside of my work day.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.960]   I have a few things I do.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.360]   I do keep books around.
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.760]   So I do have downtime, like a meeting lunch, for example, to have a book to read.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.740]   I will do that.
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.840]   Our family often has a reading block in the evening.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:11.440]   It's just not every day, but it's not an uncommon post dinner activity.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.600]   Like let's let's all go do some reading.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.640]   I will sometimes add an impromptu reading block during the workday itself, not necessarily
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.520]   a time block, just if something got done earlier, if I have some time to kill.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.920]   And I read every night after the whole family goes to bed.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:31.200]   And so depending on how into I'm in a book, I might stay up later than other days.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.560]   That gets through a lot of books.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.840]   And then I combine that with finishing sprints.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.320]   Hey, I'm into this book.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.120]   I did this the other day.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.200]   It was 100 pages into a 300 page book.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.480]   I'm like, you know what?
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.480]   I have some time.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.840]   Let's just go for it.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.040]   And I read for like two hours that evening, another hour that night after I went to bed
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.480]   and just like this, knock this book out.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.880]   So finishing sprints also help there.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.400]   My fastest book reading recently, actually, Jesse, is I got a book to thirst.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:04.060]   Someone recommended it to me on a Thursday at a two thirty meeting.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:11.080]   So as a meeting at two thirty, someone mentioned this book and finished it by Friday, Friday,
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.080]   Friday evening.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.440]   So sometimes I just go for it.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.040]   Like I just stayed up late tonight, got up, read, put aside time to read.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.280]   So sometimes if I'm really into a book, I just rock and rolled.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:25.440]   I had a pretty cool sprint the other day because my loan was ending at the library on Kindle.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.720]   And then so I was like, I got to finish this in a day.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:36.320]   Now, you know, the trick, if you leave that the book open on your Kindle, it will it won't
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.240]   take it back unless you actually leave that book and go somewhere else.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.240]   Oh, really?
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.280]   So if you have a loan from the library on your Kindle, my wife does this a lot.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.240]   If you accidentally click out of the book and go somewhere else, it sucks it back.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.160]   It can't suck it back when it's literally open.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.720]   So just leave it open on your Kindle.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.760]   You can you can buy yourself some extra time.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.640]   How is the technology not advanced enough to be able to do that?
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.640]   I don't know.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.040]   It seems weird, doesn't it?
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.780]   And maybe it's different because you'd be D.C. or Virginia.
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:08.160]   This is Montgomery County Public Library, but they're probably all using Libby.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.160]   Libby.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.160]   Yes.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.560]   And now that we've said that publicly, they're going to close that loophole.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:19.360]   My wife's always bragging to me about, like, I got this from the library and could keep
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.360]   it open.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.360]   I got that from the library.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.520]   And I'm like, you know, you're married to a writer who makes his money off people buying
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.520]   his books.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.440]   Like, why are you always bragging to me about how much little little money you've managed
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.560]   to spend to read books?
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.880]   I am a maximalist.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:38.280]   I buy books just because I I'm not even going to read it.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.280]   I buy books.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.240]   I will on multiple occasions.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.720]   I'll buy a book.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.880]   I'm excited to read like from Amazon and then like, oh, there's not going to get here for
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.880]   four days.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.040]   I'll buy the Kindle version and read it while I'm waiting for the heart.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.040]   Really?
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.040]   Physical copy to come.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.400]   I'm like, I'm into this book and I'll probably want to have a physical copy for my library.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.040]   I've done this twice now in the last two weeks where I bought two copies of the book.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.080]   I'm a book buying maximalist because it was one of the things when I was coming up in
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.520]   grad school, I had no money.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.240]   A lot of student loans, no money.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.600]   I was a grad student and was, you know, starting to make some money from the blog just like
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:14.960]   a little bit to me, like the greatest thing of any financial windfall I've ever have is
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.600]   where the Amazon associate links on my blog at calnewport.com.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.040]   Oh, you mentioned this before.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.000]   Allowed me to basically buy books.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.560]   And we're talking, it was like $200 a month in Amazon credits.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.400]   But I was like, basically I could buy any book I wanted.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.480]   And to me that was the greatest.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.680]   All other financial milestones I've passed.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.680]   The ability to not have to worry about buying the cost of buying books has always been the
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.680]   greatest.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.000]   So because I'm a writer, I'm just always, I just buy books left and right.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.320]   I want the authors to have the money.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.680]   So if you ever have to move, you're gonna have to pack up a lot of books.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.020]   Um, but I, so I, the way I deal with that, I talked about this on the show is I have my
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.880]   various shelves.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.880]   So like my study at my house has a bunch of built in shelves and then our family room
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.880]   has a bunch of built in shelves.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.800]   And then we keep two bookshelves here at the HQ.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.400]   That's my space.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.520]   So things have to rotate out.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.800]   So as new stuff comes in, I'll just take the worst stuff off the shelf to replace it with
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.140]   stuff I like better.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:16.880]   So like over time, the, your number of books, once you reach stasis doesn't increase, but
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.240]   the quality of your collection goes.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.880]   So then you just donate those to the library?
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.880]   Okay.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880]   Or wherever.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.880]   I do the same thing with my closet actually.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880]   You donate it to places that'll take them.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.560]   And then that way over time you get like a better and better collection.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.560]   And so like now I'm in the process of getting rid of books.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.560]   You're like, yeah, I kept this, but like it's not so great.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.640]   Um, all right, let's do a call.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.760]   I always like those.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.760]   Sounds good.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   Hi, my name is Sahil.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.640]   First, I just wanted to thank you for your books.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   Your book, Deep Work has had a profound impact on my life.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.000]   It motivated me to return to school in computer science.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.960]   After having not been a great student for most of my life, I've been able to maintain
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:03.920]   a 4.0 GPA and was recently awarded a job at a Fang tech company, which has been amazing.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.280]   My question now was the way I was able to achieve all these results was through a lot
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.520]   of shallow work where I followed your advice, the removing distractions where I removed
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.840]   video games, I removed social networks, I removed a lot of my friends and hangouts that
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:18.120]   I was participating in and just completely focused on school.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.720]   Unfortunately, I also was not able to focus deeply.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.760]   So a lot of times I was zoned out during class or have to watch lecture recordings three,
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.400]   four times before truly understanding the material.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   So I was just working for ridiculously long stretches of time in order to achieve these
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   results.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.280]   I realized that's not going to be possible going into my career, nor do I want it to
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.800]   be possible because it takes a huge toll on my life.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:46.000]   So my question is how can I actually train those deep focus muscles to actually get tasks
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.440]   done in less time and actually focus deeply?
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   Thank you.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.800]   Well, Sahil, I appreciate this because it's a mix of a case study and a good question.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.560]   It was a nice case study there.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.880]   This goes back to what we were just talking about with students being terrible at being
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.760]   students and how if you're not terrible at being a student, you have this huge advantage.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.360]   Here is another example.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.520]   Sahil said, I was not a good student.
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:15.840]   I returned to work actually caring about the mechanics of being a student and got a began
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:19.920]   getting four O's, perfect GPAs and got a job at a Fane company, Fane company.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:25.680]   These are the big tech companies, so Facebook, Amazon, Google.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.080]   And what's the in in Fane?
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.960]   I think Microsoft, but that's an in.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.960]   Netflix, right?
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.960]   Netflix.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.440]   So see, it works.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.860]   Caring about how you work works.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.320]   By the way, the same thing happens in the world of work as well.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.220]   It's a little bit less pronounced because the floor is higher.
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:47.820]   So in the world of students, of college students, the floor on people's work habits is so low,
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.820]   so low.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:53.260]   Like, I'm surprised that like you aren't walking in the walls low, that if you're a little
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.780]   bit organized, you have this huge relative gap in the world of work.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.780]   The floor is higher.
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:02.540]   If you worked at a normal job, like most college students work at their at their work, you
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:03.920]   would get fired pretty quickly.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.660]   But the floor is not super high.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:11.060]   And a lot of people are just throwing stress and anxiety and just hours at raising the
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.220]   floor.
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:18.140]   So again, being systematic about how you organize yourself in the world of work, it still opens
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:21.620]   up a gap with most people that you can get a big reward out of.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.500]   Let's get to the actual question, though.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:29.000]   So Sahil worries, we're not very comfortable with long periods of intense focus.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.500]   So as a student, he could just take a lot of time doing half focus.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.660]   He's not going to do that in his job.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.800]   How do you get better at actually training your ability to concentrate for long periods
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800]   of time?
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.360]   So I'm going to give you three pieces of advice.
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.300]   One is interval training.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:48.500]   You literally practice hard concentration using a timer.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.060]   So you take a piece of work you're going to do.
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:55.340]   You set a timer maybe for 30 minutes and you say for that 30 minutes, this is full out
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.780]   intense concentration.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:59.020]   If my mind wanders or I zone out, I stop that time.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.220]   I'll come back and try this again later.
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.160]   So you have a clear indicator of success or failure.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:08.700]   Success means I maintained full concentration for basically the whole period.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:13.340]   Once you're comfortable with a given duration, you up the time by 10 minutes.
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:17.840]   You're just straight up practicing hard concentration.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.900]   If you're roughly at a rate, which is what I've observed when I've done this with students
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:25.740]   of increasing the duration roughly once every week or two, you can in about two or three
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:30.040]   months significantly improve your comfort level with intense concentration.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.180]   So practice directly what you want to practice.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.820]   Two, reading.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.020]   That's your cognitive calisthenics right there.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:43.780]   Reading hard books, books that have difficult information or complex theories.
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:50.580]   You could read a complicated primary source like I'm going to read Nietzsche concurrently
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.740]   with a secondary source about that primary source.
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:56.220]   You can kind of go back and forth and have this framework for trying to understand the
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.980]   primary source that you're trying to read.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:04.740]   Reading is just direct exercise with sustained concentration on abstract symbolic concepts.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.740]   Big thinkers are big readers.
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.380]   So that needs to be your training.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:11.780]   And then three, you need to spend a regular time completely away from distractions.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:16.100]   This gets your mind very comfortable with itself.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.420]   Combine this with something interesting.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.620]   I would suggest hikes, walking through nature, long walks.
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.780]   Your phone is turned off in the back of your backpack just for emergencies.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:25.780]   There's nothing in your ear.
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:29.020]   It's just you and the world around you and the world between your ears.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.020]   It's just comfort.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:36.580]   Your mind gets more comfort just being with its own self-generated thoughts and not just
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.380]   reacting to digital inputs.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.380]   That's a slower gear.
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:43.580]   It gets comfortable with that slower gear.
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:46.340]   It gets more comfortable than when it comes time to do concentration on something hard
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:50.620]   because that's a slower gear than what you get when you get a bunch of those distractions.
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.380]   Just combine that then with the digital hygiene you already said you're doing, which is being
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:59.220]   careful about not having too much of algorithmically engineered distraction.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:02.300]   Be sure not to have too much of that in your life.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:06.220]   That is your metaphorical equivalent of smoking cigarettes while you're training for the marathon.
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.300]   It's kind of productive to what you want to do.
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:12.660]   So continue to be very wary about, "I'm on my phone all the time.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.660]   I'm looking at TikTok.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:15.580]   Stay away from TikTok."
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.020]   Use the phone foyer method.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:19.060]   Don't have your phone with you when you're at home.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:20.620]   Have it at the foyer.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:21.660]   You can go there if you need it.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.020]   It's not a constant companion.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.540]   All the stuff we talk about, keep up that digital hygiene as well.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:27.540]   And it's practice.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.300]   You will get better.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:32.300]   You will get better at deep thinking the more you practice.
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.500]   At first, you'll catch up to good deep thinkers around you.
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.700]   Then after a while, you'll be notably deeper with your thinking than other people around
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.380]   you and you'll reap those rewards.
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:45.020]   Before we get to our final segment, I want to do a quick case study.
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:48.580]   This is where someone sends in a brief summary of how they've used my advice.
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.900]   This case study comes from Don.
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:56.860]   Don says, "I just wanted to share details about the end result of deep work and time
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.100]   block planning practices that I learned from you.
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:02.980]   I first heard your ideas on an episode of NPR's Hidden Brain.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:07.020]   At the time, I was beginning the research for a book about the chimpanzees used during
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.020]   the first space race.
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:13.440]   Your approach helped me reframe my expectations for writing and research sessions.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:19.420]   My goal shifted from producing X number of words or finding X new sources to investing
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:23.020]   concentrated time in the work.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.460]   Your time block planner and podcast were regular reinforcers of best practices.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:31.620]   As a side note, the book just received a starred review from Kirkus and the review noted the
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.300]   book's meticulous research.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:37.780]   That meticulous research happened during deep work sessions and I can't thank you enough."
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:41.140]   Jesse, he also sent around the citation.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:46.420]   So the book, which comes out in February, is called The Astro Chimps, America's First
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:47.420]   Astronauts.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:52.100]   Well, Don, I appreciate that case study.
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:56.420]   What that gets to, and I think this is important, is that we have to, and this is one of the
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:57.700]   whole points of the book, Deep Work.
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:03.460]   You have to value the intensity of concentration.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:08.580]   Intense concentration is itself an intrinsically valuable activity and it produces extrinsically
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:13.260]   much more valuable results than less concentrated focus.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:16.820]   So just saying, "I want to make sure I write a thousand words or I spend three hours on
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:21.660]   my book," is not the same as saying, "I want to spend three hours concentrated deeply on
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:22.660]   my book."
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:27.300]   When you're doing high level knowledge creative output, like creating a book, you're doing,
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.300]   this is alchemy, right?
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:33.060]   You're trying to have this brain take in information and congeal it into something that is more
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:35.700]   valuable than the information that came in.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.700]   The harder you concentrate, the better this result is.
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:42.980]   And so the intensity of concentration should be a really key variable when we think about
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:45.900]   doing high level knowledge work, but it's often not.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:51.040]   And we know it's not because in the same companies that we make our money off of people doing
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.300]   high level knowledge work, we also say you should be on Slack.
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.700]   You should be contact shifting the email back and forth.
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:59.700]   You should be doing seven or eight meetings a day because that makes my life more convenient
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:00.700]   as a manager.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:05.660]   A complete disregard for the actual goal of trying to get intense concentration, even
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:09.340]   though intense concentration is behind almost any major value production in knowledge work.
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.460]   So I appreciate that case study, Don.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:15.700]   Not just words, it's not just hours, it's not just task list, it's concentration and
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:18.440]   the quality of the concentration that matters.
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.900]   We should talk about that more.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:24.180]   All right, we have a final segment coming up where I'll talk about the books I read
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:28.100]   in November, but first let's hear from another sponsor.
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:33.260]   In particular, I want to talk about our friends at Blinkist.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:37.900]   The Blinkist app enables you to understand the most important things from over 5,500
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:42.660]   nonfiction books and podcasts in just 15 minutes.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.180]   These short summaries are called Blinks.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:48.140]   You can read them on the app or you can listen to them in your ear if you're doing something
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.140]   else.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.300]   Thousands of these top nonfiction books have these summaries available through the Blinkist
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.820]   app.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:14:01.180]   The way that Jesse and I use Blinkist is to triage what we want to read or not read.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:05.780]   The back jacket of a book gives you a sense of what's in a book, but it's typically not
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:08.060]   super detailed.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:12.380]   Reading a blink of a book, a 15-minute summary, which covers the actual main ideas, gives
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:17.540]   you a much better sense of what is this book about and is it really worth reading.
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.620]   It's very effective.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:23.740]   You get a really clear intuition if you listen to a 15-minute summary of like, "Oh, I see
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:24.740]   what type of book this is.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:25.740]   Never mind."
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:26.860]   Or, "Yes, yes, yes.
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:30.020]   I want to hear details on all of those ideas."
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:33.260]   So if you're a reader, if you're a believer in deep work, you should be.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:41.780]   Blinkist is a great, think of it as an assistant or booster to the reading life.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:42.780]   Here's the good news.
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:45.860]   Right now, Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.

[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:03.020]   That's Blinkist.com/deep.
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:09.040]   And now for a limited time, you can use Blinkist Connect, a special promotion that will allow
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.780]   you to share your premium account.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:15.500]   You will be able to get two premium subscriptions for the price of one.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:22.260]   We also want to talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:26.140]   If you do not use a VPN, you should.
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:31.540]   If you don't use a VPN, people can see what websites and services you're communicating
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.020]   with.
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:36.540]   If you're at a wireless access point, people nearby can sniff those packets right out of
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:37.540]   the air.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:40.580]   If you're at home, your internet service provider can see your packets and gather this data
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.980]   and sell it to advertisers, which they do.
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:48.660]   So even if the content of your messages is encrypted, the headers that say who you're
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:51.020]   talking to, what website, what service are not.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:55.420]   And so everyone can know what you're using with your internet time.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.460]   VPN saves you from that and gives you privacy.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:04.220]   The way a VPN works is that you write down who you really want to talk to in an encrypted
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:05.220]   message.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.820]   You send that to a VPN server.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.260]   The VPN server then talks to that site or service on your behalf, encrypts the response
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.260]   and sends it back.
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:14.860]   So the people who are watching you know nothing beyond the fact that you're using a VPN.
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:18.060]   They have no idea what site or service you're using.
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:21.700]   If you're going to use a VPN, I recommend ExpressVPN because they make this process
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:22.700]   so simple.
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:26.380]   You put their software on the devices you use, you click one button, it turns on and
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.340]   you use your apps just like you would normally.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:32.380]   All this happens in the background seamlessly.
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.980]   They have servers all around the world.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:38.060]   So wherever you are, there is probably an ExpressVPN server nearby.
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:44.460]   So you can have a very fast connection or a little hint, you can purposely choose to
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:49.620]   connect to an ExpressVPN server in a part of the country that a country that's different
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:55.340]   than yours in order to access information that's only available to people in that country.
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:17:00.180]   I know people for example, who will in the US connect to an ExpressVPN server in the
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:05.740]   UK and then watch Netflix because there's shows like The Office that are on Netflix
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:06.820]   in the UK.
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:11.020]   As far as Netflix is concerned, because they're just hearing from the VPN server, you're from
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:12.020]   the UK.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:14.660]   So there's these little hints you can do with it as well.
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:17.620]   ExpressVPN also has good bandwidth.
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:21.220]   So again, very fast, very fast connection.
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.820]   So if you're looking to gain some privacy, or maybe check out some shows that aren't
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:32.700]   available in your country, give yourself the gift of a VPN, go to ExpressVPN.com/deep right
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:37.740]   now, and you will get an extra three months of ExpressVPN for free.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:43.140]   That's ExpressVPN.com/deep ExpressVPN.com/deep to learn more.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:52.140]   All right, Jesse, let's do our final segment, where I talk about the books I read in November.
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.660]   Those who don't know, I try to read five books a month and the first podcast or so of each
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.700]   new month, I talked about the books I read in the month before.
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:07.940]   All right, so the first book I read in November was The Identity Trap by Yasha Monk.
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:11.540]   Interesting, I talked to Yasha more recently after I read this book.
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:16.500]   It turns out when I was up at Dartmouth last summer on a fellowship, he was also up at
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:19.100]   Dartmouth on a fellowship, but we never crossed paths.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:20.100]   We didn't realize it.
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:21.780]   We're both from the DC area.
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.860]   At some point, some of my students talked about, "Oh, I just went to see Yasha Monk
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:25.860]   give a talk."
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:29.180]   I didn't realize we were both there simultaneously, and we just didn't know it.
[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.620]   He doesn't listen to the show?
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:31.620]   I guess not.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:32.620]   Dude.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:34.020]   Yeah, that's on you, Yasha.
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:35.020]   You should have known.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:37.100]   That's how we know you don't listen to the show.
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.620]   Yasha's an academic.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:44.380]   He's at Johns Hopkins, works a lot in international relations.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:48.620]   The Identity Trap is taking a look that has two goals.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:58.660]   Goal number one is to try to just give a scholastic history of the modern progressive thought,
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:04.540]   the collection of theories that will sometimes be crudely summarized as woke, what I often
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:07.140]   call on the show postmodern critical theories.
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.960]   The first half of his book is academic history.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.740]   Where did the particular collection of ideas that make up this collection of beliefs that
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:19.360]   the modern progressive left have, where do they come from?
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.220]   Yasha calls it the identity synthesis.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:26.980]   The second part of the book is then him making an argument for, "Do these ideas work for
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:31.060]   accomplishing the goal that they have, which is justice?
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:32.300]   And if not, what works better?"
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:38.140]   So we've heard of history, then an analysis of what we have, is it actually working?
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:43.140]   I know these histories pretty well because I've been an academic my entire life.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:46.260]   I watched a lot of these ideas come together.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:48.060]   I've read multiple books on this as well.
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:49.260]   Yasha's was really good.
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:54.420]   I thought it was really accessible, but also really accurate.
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:59.120]   There's a lot of complexities because academic theories are complicated.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.240]   This begets this, and this is similar to this, but not quite this.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.340]   It's easy to get lost in that complexity.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:08.780]   I think Yasha did a great job of saying, "Let me cut through.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:12.900]   Here's basically, here's the through lines you need to care about."
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:18.340]   So if you're wondering about where did all these ideas we hear today from modern progressives
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:22.140]   that are everywhere, where do they come from?
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:29.260]   This book is the best one I've read to give a sort of objective story.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:37.020]   The short version of his story, and I think this is probably right, is that the two big
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:42.340]   theories emerging in the '80s and '90s on which a lot of the current, what he calls
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:46.580]   identity synthesis came from, is he really says the two main ones that begat most of
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:52.100]   the other important ones would be post-colonial theory, as in particular initiated by Edward
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.100]   Said.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:21:00.700]   So when I was in grad school in the early 2000s, post-colonial theory was the thing.
[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:03.980]   Everyone was choosing, all the humanities students were choosing Arabic as their language
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:10.740]   so that they could do Edward Said-style studies of post-colonial theory.
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.460]   And then the other big progenitor of the modern thinking would be Derrick Bell's critical
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:16.700]   race theory.
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:23.260]   Most of these drew heavily from postmodernism, and in particular Michel Foucault's notions
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:30.700]   of postmodernisms and the way various discourses create and maintain power imbalances.
[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:34.220]   Now there's this, and I won't go too long on this because I'm an academic and I'm a
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:37.980]   nerd and most people aren't nerds and don't like nerds, I won't go too long on this, but
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.100]   I just love academic theories.
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:45.140]   There's an irony in this because the postmodernism of Foucault was a reaction to the grand theories
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:50.340]   of Marxism and basically these French intellectuals were disillusioned.
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:53.540]   Marxism kind of fell apart because it turned out like, "Eh, the Soviet Union wasn't so
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:54.540]   great."
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:58.860]   So like the ideas, these radical ideas got put into action in a lot of places and it
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:01.580]   didn't go well.
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:06.620]   And so a lot of steam fell out of Marxism as a sort of foundational theoretical family
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.060]   that a lot of academics were drawing from.
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:11.240]   And the postmoderns were very nihilistic and existential.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:15.240]   And they didn't think that any sort of grand political theory of like, "This explains
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.040]   the world and it's going to improve the world if we just do this."
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:21.960]   They gave up on all of that and they talked about, so it was a deconstruction, right?
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.120]   It was all about deconstructing these theories.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.520]   They hated the idea of grand narratives.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:29.880]   Well, you get Sayeed, you get Bell, they're taking these ideas from the postmoderns in
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:34.360]   particular about how language can construct and be used to reinforce power dynamics.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:38.520]   And they said, "Let's use this to create grand narratives.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.880]   Let's use this to actually create political movements, explain the way the world works
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.160]   and suggest actual action."
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:48.440]   So they're using postmodernism to do the exact opposite of what the postmoderns thought that
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.440]   you should do.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.880]   So there's a little bit of irony embedded in that.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:55.720]   But anyways, from postcolonial theory and from critical race theory, you get a lot of
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:02.480]   branches of related descendant theories and connected theories and almost all the ideas
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:10.600]   that you would hear today in a DEI seminar or in a march at a college campus, where you're
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.120]   like, "Where do these terms come from?"
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.120]   All of it comes back there.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.400]   So it was a really, I think, focusing on postcolonial theory and critical race theory, in particular
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:24.960]   Sayeed and Bell's initial movements in these worlds and all the ideas they collected afterwards,
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.960]   it's right.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:26.960]   I think it reads right.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:27.960]   It is a good history.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.200]   So it's a really good book and it's accessible.
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:34.360]   He writes it much more accessible than even I just talked about it there.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.360]   What is his analysis?
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:40.820]   Well, he's a big believer in what he calls philosophical liberalism, which is not sexy.
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:43.080]   It doesn't have complicated theory.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.040]   It doesn't draw from Foucault.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.960]   Its core ideas have been around for three millennia.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:54.720]   Its core ideas have been at the core of essentially every major justice movement in the history
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.560]   of humanity.
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:00.880]   We're thinking just even more recently, the civil rights movement, the gay rights movements,
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:06.480]   a lot of these recent, even the recent big wins we've seen in the fight for justice all
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:09.360]   came from philosophical liberalism.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:15.760]   It's not exciting and it's in opposition to the ideas in the identity synthesis, which
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:21.760]   actually try to deconstruct a lot of the key ideas behind philosophical liberalism.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.960]   It's more utopian and dystopian at the same time.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:28.360]   And Monk makes a pretty good argument of like, I know it's not exciting, but philosophical
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:33.360]   liberalism, which is, it's flexible, but also matches our moral intuitions that go back
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:40.000]   to our very earliest emergence of ethics in the very earliest books of the Hebrew Bible.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.200]   This idea is what works.
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:45.440]   So there's this nice sort of polemic as well of, let me analyze these.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.440]   I don't think the identity synthesis is going to lead us to more justice.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.440]   I think we have these, these older ideas do.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.080]   So I think it's a great treatment.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.560]   It's not that long.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.400]   It seems very informed.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.520]   It seems very even handed.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.560]   And so I think it's useful, especially if you're young or sort of new to this, like
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.640]   something that happens with grand theories is the problem is if you're like 19 and you
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:13.200]   go to college and you encounter whatever grand theory is big at the time, the dialectic in
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:16.840]   your mind is, or the binary in your mind is no theory in theory.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:20.640]   And so you just think of it as like, most people just don't realize that there's theories
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.000]   that explain the world and we can use these theories to figure out better ways of living.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.360]   But I do understand that.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.960]   So you just see it as this binary between no theory and theory.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.840]   The good thing about books like monks is it steps back and says, no, there's many different
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.840]   theories.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.720]   So you can't just look at the connection between, I see the world theoretically, or I don't,
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:43.600]   you have to say, why do I see it through this theoretical framework?
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.440]   There's other ones.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.860]   Like for example, if you're on a college campus, this is something I think people get wrong
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:55.000]   about the modern identity synthesis or postmodern critical theories, outside observers think
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.840]   that, oh, everyone on a college campus is just completely locked into this and thinks
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.960]   that's the way the world works.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:06.160]   It's how you get the sort of Ron DeSantis of the world being like, we have to just like
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.320]   defund colleges and it's all crazy.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:13.240]   If you go to a college campus and go to a philosophy department, philosophers hate that
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.240]   stuff.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.240]   They're like, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.320]   Well, hold on, hold on.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.220]   We have been studying philosophy forever.
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.220]   This is our expertise.
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:22.660]   Like these theories, these are wonky.
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:24.900]   It's not good philosophy.
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:25.900]   They're intellectually inconsistent.
[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:30.500]   It's like philosophers don't tend to like the identity synthesis.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:34.780]   And these are people on the same campus, professional ethicists don't tend to like it.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:41.980]   So it's not, you have to evaluate these things and not just say it's binary verse, no theory
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:42.980]   or theory.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:45.340]   But when you first go to college, so if you went to college 50 years ago, it would have
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:49.100]   been classical economic class-based Marxism was everywhere.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:52.260]   Every professor seemed like they were talking about it and that would be the big thing.
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.260]   But then that fell out of favor.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:57.900]   And so now we have the identity synthesis and some other things are competing with it
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:59.420]   and those will fall out of favor eventually.
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:05.300]   So you have to have some epistemic humility when thinking about theories and not just
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:09.180]   see it as dumb people don't know about theories and I know about the capital T theory.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.260]   There's lots of different theories.
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.900]   So it's important to step back and say, where did this one come from?
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:14.980]   What does it say?
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.260]   What are the alternatives?
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:18.180]   How do I feel about these different alternatives?
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:20.820]   Why is this the right one versus the other right one?
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:26.600]   And of course, be very suspicious if the proponents of a particular theory say, wait, asking questions
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.780]   about it is that's wrong.
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:30.100]   Don't don't don't ask questions.
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:33.860]   Always be nervous about that with any particular theory.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:37.980]   Of course, you can ask those in Soviet Russia who ask questions about does this make sense
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:40.060]   and found themselves quite cold in Siberia.
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:44.640]   So you have to be, you do have to be careful about that particular strain.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.400]   So anyways, I like these type of discussions.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.700]   What I told Yasha about is when I was up at Dartmouth, there'll be a final thing I'll
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:51.700]   say on this.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:57.380]   When I was up at Dartmouth, I was reading books from people who had had the same fellowship
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:58.820]   over the decades earlier, right?
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:03.260]   The Montgomery Fellowship had been around for a long time and they buy the books of
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:05.160]   the fellows and put them on the shelf.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:10.980]   And so they had a copy of John Kenneth Galbraith's The Affluent Society, which he wrote in the
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:12.380]   late 50s, early 60s.
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:15.500]   And so I was reading that just because it was there on the shelf.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:18.940]   And Galbraith had come through in the 70s or something like that to be a fellow.
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:21.940]   And I have to go back and find this quote, but he has this.
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:26.260]   He was writing this at a time when Marxism was really big on college campuses.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:29.620]   It was like the unifying framework of a lot of different departments on campus.
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:35.020]   And this is sort of the classic kind of class-based Marxism.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.020]   And it was really big.
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:39.740]   And there was a sort of Marxist critical theory from the 1930s.
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:43.500]   It greatly expanded where you could apply Marxism, not just economics.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:44.980]   It was everywhere.
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:47.660]   So that was the big theory of the time.
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:51.340]   And Galbraith has this throwaway line where he's like, "This is really popular right
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:52.340]   now."
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:55.980]   And he didn't, obviously he was not a Marxist, but he's like, "This is really popular right
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:56.980]   now on college campuses.
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:59.260]   Why is this so popular among so many thinkers?"
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:04.620]   And this interesting line, he said, "I don't think most of these thinkers are fully on
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:07.540]   board with all of the actual implications of these theories."
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:12.060]   Because a lot of them, when it goes back and studies, it can be kind of kooky.
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:16.700]   He says, "The real issue here is that these theories are complicated.
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:19.320]   To understand them means you're smart.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:24.420]   The fear is that if you don't demonstrate you understand them, people might think you're
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:25.860]   not smart.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.860]   And that's a huge motivator."
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:29.460]   And it was John Kess, Galbraith's analysis.
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:30.540]   So why did this theory spread?
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:34.180]   It's not because all of these anthropologists and all these economists and all these social
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:38.980]   scientists, they all were really on board with the really intricate proposals of Marxism,
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:41.020]   but it was complicated.
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:44.840]   And to be involved in that theory meant you're with the smart kids table.
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.220]   And to not meant that maybe people would think you couldn't keep up.
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:53.780]   So that's just something to keep in mind whenever a grand theory is sweeping through intellectual
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:54.940]   worlds.
[01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:58.100]   It could be that everyone has studied this thing and read Yasha's book and said, "This
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.100]   is right."
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:02.180]   It could also be that people want to seem smart.
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:04.420]   Simple questions, all were raised by a book.
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:05.540]   That's the sign of a good book.
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:06.540]   So good work, Yasha.
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.060]   Definitely worth checking out.
[01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:10.060]   All right.
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:11.060]   So then moving on.
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:16.540]   The next book I read was Israel by Martin Gilbert.
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:20.820]   Really steering towards a controversy in my books this week.
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:21.820]   What else?
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:27.940]   The next book we read is Apple Pie is Bad.
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:32.540]   And a book that is, I think like what all the, oh God.
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:34.340]   Anyways, Israel by Martin Gilbert.
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:36.540]   This was part of my, I mentioned this last week.
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:42.540]   I got three books about that part of the world to read back to back to back after October
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:43.860]   7th.
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.180]   This book's written by Martin Gilbert.
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:46.740]   This is not an Israeli book.
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:50.160]   This is a book written by a British historian.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:55.140]   So it's just more of, I just wanted a TikTok view of like 1850.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:58.380]   This goes up to about, I think the second Intifada.
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:01.660]   So like early 2000s, just TikTok history, right?
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:04.020]   This is not someone, it's not a Palestinian writer.
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:05.100]   It's not an Israeli writer.
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:06.460]   Just like, let's get the six.
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.180]   This is a tome too, as you might imagine.
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.180]   Big tome.
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:14.100]   Hard book to write just because it's a lot of history to fit in the six or 700 pages.
[01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:18.540]   And I thought Gilbert did a really good job in his redaction.
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:21.140]   What things to talk about and how not to get lost in the details.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:24.220]   So just as a work of history, I thought it was good.
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:28.660]   I mean, it's not edgy or seed excitement.
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:29.660]   It's long.
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:35.220]   We're talking about like, it's straight up history.
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:39.600]   But I thought it was, you know, I do now have the TikTok history of this happened in this
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:40.600]   year and that happened.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:47.020]   And here is who this person was and who that person was and how the rise of the PLO and
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:52.580]   Arafat and how that changed the PLA and just getting the on the ground details.
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:57.780]   So if you're looking for a sort of non-polemical history of that part of the world, I learned
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:02.340]   a lot, especially as compared to Noah Tishbe's book, which is much, much more, I think, polemical
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:07.140]   and has an actual goal, like a sort of pro-Israel goal.
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:11.500]   This book just felt comparably speaking, let's just get the facts.
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.500]   So it's useful.
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:13.500]   I know a lot more about that history.
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.180]   I know a lot more about those names.
[01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:17.180]   Moving on.
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:24.180]   I also read letters to my Palestinian neighbor by Yossi Klein Halevi, who I really like.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:26.660]   Actually, he went on Ezra Klein's podcast recently.
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:29.860]   I think that episode is worth listening to.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.860]   This book is interesting.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:36.800]   You need to get the current edition because it's actually two books in one.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:44.380]   So it's the original, the original book, letters to my Palestinian neighbor, followed by a
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:48.140]   bunch of responses from Palestinians to the original book.
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:52.420]   So you read the original book and then you get a bunch of responses that were sent back.
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:57.980]   And so it's almost like a dialogue, though you get this book and then the responses.
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:01.900]   But I thought that was really interesting to get those responses.
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:03.460]   Yossi is a very interesting character.
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:08.100]   Again, I mentioned before, he was someone who was on the Israeli right wing, who over
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:12.060]   time moved to the Israeli left wing.
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:18.860]   So he has sort of an interesting self-reflective view on Israel and Palestine and the peace
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:19.860]   process.
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:24.300]   And so I thought this book with those two parts, his letters and then the letters back,
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.540]   was really interesting.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:27.540]   Also kind of hopeful.
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:28.540]   It was an interesting book.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:33.020]   He has a podcast, by the way, the Hartman Institute produces it called For Heaven's
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:34.420]   Sake.
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:37.020]   And it's every week or twice a week.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.140]   It's him and another host.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:39.660]   It's like 20 minutes an episode.
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:43.980]   And it's if you really want to understand what's happening inside Israel right now,
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:44.980]   it's like really good.
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:48.420]   It's an English language podcast where they're really bring you up to speed on what the mood
[01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:51.100]   is in the country and the dynamics and the political factions.
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.500]   So it's a useful podcast.
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.900]   All right.
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:58.860]   Then I changed gears because that was a lot of hard reading and read two books that are
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:02.820]   maybe a little bit less intellectually sophisticated.
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:07.260]   Be Useful by our friend Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:10.620]   This was, I guess it's a self-help book.
[01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:14.820]   It has like seven ideas and he gives his advice.
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:20.220]   I think my recommendation, I think Arnold is an interesting person and in a lot of ways
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:23.900]   an inspiring person and has good advice to give.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:29.740]   My advice would be to instead of reading this, read his autobiography, Total Recall.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:34.180]   And you will extract for yourself a lot of these same ideas, but it's just his story
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:35.500]   is so interesting.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.620]   When you read Be Useful, you're just going to want more of his story.
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:40.140]   So just read his story.
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:42.900]   Total Recall is a fantastic autobiography.
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:48.420]   And I would say every lesson in Be Useful, you will extract for yourself as just a consequence
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:50.300]   of reading his autobiography.
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.300]   So that would be my recommendation.
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.540]   And then finally, I read John Grisham's newest book, The Exchange.
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:56.900]   It was okay.
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:57.900]   Not much happens.
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.060]   It's a follow-up to The Firm.
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:03.220]   It mainly just helped remind me how good The Firm was.
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:04.220]   It's interesting.
[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:08.060]   I mean, these hit books early on, the books that follow don't have to be so good.
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:13.420]   Like there's no way, The Exchange is a fine book, but if this was a debut book, there's
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.980]   no way it would grab a lot of attention.
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:19.260]   I mean, not that much happens in it.
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:20.900]   It just reminded me of how good The Firm was.
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:27.220]   So I'm not giving that my Roger and Ebert two thumbs up, I suppose.
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:31.940]   Which by the way, I'm thinking about because I'm reading a book about Siskel and Ebert.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:34.780]   I'm reading a book about Siskel and Ebert right now, which is kind of interesting.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:35.780]   But it was fine.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:39.340]   If you like Grisham, it's fine, but it's not The Firm.
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:40.340]   So there we go.
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:45.700]   Those were my books, a real mix of high and low this week, from academic theories to political
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:49.380]   conflict to Arnold Schwarzenegger giving-
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:53.540]   The identity trap explanation was spot on.
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:55.020]   That was good.
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:57.140]   I love academic theories.
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:58.620]   I love academic theories.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:06.780]   I just, well, it's probably not a fair hope for the world that everyone has time to, not
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:12.940]   everyone's professional academics, to deeply engage in ideas and theories.
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:17.980]   But it's water for me, it's deeply engaging with ideas and theories.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:21.820]   Yasha did a great job of summarizing these particular theories, what's good, what's
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:22.820]   bad.
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:25.060]   He makes a pretty compelling case for philosophical liberalism.
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:31.140]   I've made a case for philosophical liberalism in so many words, many times before on the
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:33.180]   show as well.
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:34.180]   So he's an interesting guy.
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.980]   I want to go up there and spend some time with him.
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:37.340]   Is he up there full time?
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:38.340]   Yeah, he's at Hopkins.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.340]   Oh, right.
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:40.340]   Yeah, it's not far.
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.340]   Yeah.
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:42.340]   Baltimore's not far.
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:43.340]   Yeah.
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:44.340]   I was thinking about Dartmouth for a sec.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:45.740]   No, he was just up there for the summer.
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:49.340]   You know, because everyone who lives in the mid-Atlantic, if we're given the excuse to
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:53.220]   go to New England during the summer, we'll go to New England in the summer.
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:58.660]   We could be like, "Hey, we want you to be a fellow at our water park outside Durham,
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:04.420]   New Hampshire, where what we mainly need you to do is help make sure we don't have people
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:07.940]   go down the slide too soon after each other.
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:11.540]   But also, you can lecture on artificial intelligence."
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.540]   We'd be like, "Yeah.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.260]   Durham, what's the average high in July?
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:15.260]   All right, we'll be there.
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:18.740]   We all want to get out of the swamp town for the summer."
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:20.620]   All right, speaking of which, that's enough time.
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:22.620]   I think we've spent enough time talking today.

[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:42.700]   So if you enjoyed today's episode about how to get started on being more organized, I
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:50.380]   think you will also like episode 272, where I go on to list the essential tools for having
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:53.580]   a sustainable organizational system.
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:57.580]   My friend, David Epstein, joins me halfway through that episode to help as well.
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:59.340]   So it's definitely worth watching.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:00.340]   Check it out.
[01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:07.100]   The goal for today's deep dive is to go through four essential tools that you need to build
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:08.260]   your productivity toolkit.
