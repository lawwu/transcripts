[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:38.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.840]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.520]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520]   of Bogle Heads-On Investing.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.840]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.280]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.780]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.640]   that can be found at boglecenter.net.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.440]   Today, our special guest is Sarah Newcombe.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.800]   Dr. Newcombe is a behavioral economist for Morningstar
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.120]   and the author of the book Loaded--
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.240]   Money, Psychology, and How to Get Ahead Without Leaving
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.320]   Your Values Behind.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.000]   I think you're really going to enjoy this podcast.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.680]   It focuses on the fear of money.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.860]   And even though you may not have a fear of money,
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800]   you know people who do.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.400]   Today, we're going to find out why that is
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.120]   and how all people along the economic spectrum
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.400]   are overcoming their fears.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.400]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Sarah Newcombe.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.120]   Welcome to the podcast, Sarah.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.800]   Thanks, Rick.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.000]   Great to be here.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.400]   Well, thank you for doing this.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.940]   You're an expert on psychology and money.
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.720]   And today, we're going to be doing a deep dive
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.560]   into the psychology of people and how they approach money.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.000]   Some people are afraid of money.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.960]   Some people don't want to deal with money.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.400]   And this podcast is devoted to those people who do not
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.480]   have a good relationship with money,
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.200]   even though they may have a lot of money.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.280]   So Sarah, with that in mind, start the conversation,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.440]   if you will, with how you and your background
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.200]   got to the point where you studied this phenomenon,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.680]   the fear of money.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.040]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.440]   Well, so one of my favorite definitions of expert
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.880]   is someone who has made all the mistakes that
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.240]   can be made in a certain area.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.720]   That's how you get to be an expert.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.320]   And that is absolutely how I got to be an expert
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.680]   in financial psychology.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.000]   I found myself in my late 20s with a degree in math.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.560]   I love numbers.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.440]   I will work on logic puzzles and number puzzles
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.240]   for an inordinate amount of time,
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.000]   and I have such a good time with it.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.840]   And yet, I still, with a degree in math,
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.520]   could not get my finances together.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.920]   And at that point in my life, having grown up
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.240]   in a situation with no or very little money
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.600]   and having to put myself through undergraduate school
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.840]   starting at 24, really starting from zero in survival mode,
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.840]   I was having to wrestle with my finances.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.560]   And you would think that if I could
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.000]   handle the fundamental theorem of calculus,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.120]   then I should have been able to get my finances together.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.160]   And I couldn't.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.800]   I was still living pretty much hand to mouth,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.160]   and I was married with a child with a math degree.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.320]   And I thought, this cannot be about numbers.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.480]   It just is not about numbers.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.200]   And I started to get really curious at that point.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   I had been frustrated with money and with my--
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.040]   what I thought was just an inability
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.760]   to manage my own money.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.040]   I just thought of myself as, I'm not good with money.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.720]   And that was part of my identity at that point.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.200]   When I started to get curious, I started to think,
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.120]   wait a minute.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.760]   If I can handle calculus, I should
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.520]   be able to handle money.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.360]   What is it that's going on here?
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.720]   There's something else going on.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.560]   So that curiosity-- and it was a combination
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.360]   of the curiosity, intellectual curiosity,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.360]   but also just exhaustion.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.120]   Because the reality is that when money is tight,
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.320]   life is stressful.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.920]   And I had spent my entire life up to that point
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.040]   always in a situation where money was tight,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.920]   whether it was my parents' finances or my own.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.800]   The stress of not having enough had always
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.960]   been hanging over me.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.160]   And it's exhausting.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.240]   And I was tired of it.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.080]   I was tired of being poor.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.920]   So at 28, I gave it a lot of thought.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.680]   And I decided to leverage my math degree
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.120]   and turn it into an intellectual exercise.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.200]   I will learn how the pros do this.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.520]   I am going to go to graduate school
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.480]   for personal financial planning.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.520]   I will learn how to master money.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.280]   And I will get out of this poverty trap that I'm in.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.920]   And so I did.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.120]   I started going to Bentley for personal financial planning
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.240]   and started studying tax and estate planning and portfolio
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.760]   management and all the basics.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.480]   And I found a lot of it to be somewhat boring
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.440]   because I was hoping for more.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.000]   Oh, God, to hear you say that, I can't believe it.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.640]   But I was surprised because I thought
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.720]   that financial planning was going
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.800]   to be a lot more interesting.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.120]   I thought I'd be picking stocks.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.160]   I didn't realize I'd be scanning people for their risk profile
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.720]   and then putting them in one of various buckets based on that.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.120]   I thought there'd be more to it.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.960]   But what really got me interested in thinking
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.800]   about money differently was when I took this elective.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.320]   It was led by James Grubman.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.280]   It was the first class of its kind that we know of.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.520]   And it was on psychology in financial planning.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.320]   And it just struck me as interesting.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.960]   I thought it was good to understand how psychology
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.880]   connected to financial planning.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.560]   And in that class, for the first time,
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.640]   we did not discuss interest rates or risk or asset
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   allocation or the capital asset pricing model.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.400]   We didn't talk about any of that.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.440]   We talked about classism.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.500]   And we talked about cultural tensions.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.560]   We talked about how each of us has a personal relationship
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.000]   with money that is largely inherited and usually
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.440]   unexamined and will then affect the decisions that we
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.320]   make with our money, whether we are conscious of that or not.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.520]   And it was in that class that I started
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.760]   to really finally get power in my own relationship with money
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.120]   because I started to examine and then challenge
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.880]   the deep beliefs I had about money that
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.360]   had been creating knee-jerk responses around earning
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.120]   and spending that I had not ever examined before.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.860]   And so for me, the light bulb went on.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.360]   And I realized my issues with managing money
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.400]   weren't numeric.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.760]   They were psychological.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.840]   There were reasons why I hated and feared money.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.920]   And that was causing all sorts of unconscious decisions
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.800]   that I was sabotaging myself financially.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.840]   Sarah, you mentioned the word "inherited."
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.720]   You say you inherited these ideas.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.080]   Can you expand on that a little bit?
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.880]   Yeah, well, so interestingly, another thing
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.980]   we talked about in this class was the three-generation
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.720]   problem, the shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.320]   in three generations, how money and wealth tends
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.680]   to be built up by one generation,
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.600]   spent by the next generation, and then the third generation
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.280]   is left to start over.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.000]   Well, my parents, each of them in their own right,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.600]   happened to be that third generation.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.640]   Their grandparents had great wealth
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.040]   on both sides of my family.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.280]   Their parents inherited that wealth and squandered it.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.120]   And they themselves were left to start over.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.520]   And so both of my parents had complex relationships
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.660]   with money that involved a little bit of hostile envy
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.720]   of those who had it, for lack of a better term,
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   and some really critical attitudes
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.680]   toward wealth and the wealthy.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.400]   And without ever explicitly saying
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.040]   that they looked down on the wealthy,
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.040]   I sure got that message in lots of little ways.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.240]   My upbringing was anti-wealth.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.400]   There was also a deep religious vein in my upbringing,
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.880]   very deep religious vein, that glorified poverty
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.880]   and demonized money as being the root of all evil.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.360]   And so there was a fear that I had inherited
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.440]   that if I were to focus on making money
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.860]   and focus on financial security as a goal in my own life,
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.780]   that would mean that I was materialistic and greedy
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.840]   and therefore failed as a moral human being.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.000]   - Wow, wow.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.960]   How did you resolve this?
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.060]   - Well, it wasn't until I started to dig in
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.340]   and write my own financial story
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.520]   and start to uncover these things
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.400]   that helped me have that moment to realize
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.280]   how unhealthy my own attitudes toward money were
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.800]   and how that in the natural effect
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.160]   of that unhealthy relationship with money
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.860]   was a myriad of bad financial choices.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.040]   - I think you sum it up well in your book,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.640]   Loaded, Money Psychology and How to Get Ahead
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.920]   Without Leaving Your Values Behind.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.800]   You say in the introduction that you were brought up
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.840]   with the belief that either you cared about people
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.780]   or you cared about money.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.800]   - There was no in between.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.520]   - Yeah, and I don't think I'm the only person
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.460]   that got that message.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.920]   I think that's a message that's rampant out there.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.280]   Take our service industries, for example.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.840]   People who love serving others, teachers, social workers,
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.520]   they have notoriously low salaries
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.680]   and so they're asked to make this choice
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.960]   between serving people or serving themselves financially.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.920]   Because that's there and because we moralize
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.360]   all these things and we justify our systems to ourselves,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.560]   it's become almost a badge of honor among some
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.160]   to not earn money or not focus on money.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.000]   And that was the environment that I grew up in
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.120]   where the people that I knew and loved and respected
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.560]   had a deep disrespect for wealth and those who had it.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.860]   And I think that it was a cultural defense mechanism
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.360]   we tend to like to put down the other
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.640]   in order to feel okay about ourselves.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.640]   But this demonizing of wealth really caused me
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.680]   to fear earning and to fear money and to demonize money.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.680]   There was this little distinction I needed
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.360]   to learn how to make in my mind
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.760]   where I had conflated money itself,
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.800]   which is an inanimate object
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.320]   that you can use to any purpose,
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.720]   but I had mistaken money itself
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.000]   and was blaming money itself for the choices
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.400]   that individual people make with their stores of money.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   I looked around and I saw inequality, lots of injustice
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.360]   and money being used to exploit,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.200]   capital being used to exploit.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.680]   And it's easy to blame money and the financial system
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.760]   because it's almost easier to do that than to recognize,
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.000]   no, there are human actors making choices
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.240]   and it's more productive to deal with the human actors
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.480]   and the social systems that we have set up as human actors.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   That's where our frustration and our efforts at change
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.280]   are really actually productive.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.140]   But if we just blame money, which a lot of people do,
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.080]   they just decide not to have anything to do with money
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.600]   or the financial system.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.620]   They just say, well, money corrupts people
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.200]   and I don't wanna think about money.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.800]   I don't wanna be the kind of person that focuses on money.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.120]   I wanna focus on something else.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.560]   And it may be a very easy decision to make in the choice
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.040]   or in that moment.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.080]   It relieves the psychological pressure in the moment
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.440]   and you feel better.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.920]   But the problem with dismissing the world of money
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.760]   in that way is that you never learn how to use it
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.760]   to create the world you want.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.360]   And so you are left with fewer resources
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.600]   to make the world you want.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.080]   And I think that's just a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.560]   Then the only thing we have is a whole bunch of people
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.240]   who are materialistic handling all the money.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.840]   That's not good for everybody either.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.480]   - You took this course.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.120]   It was sort of a life-changing course
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.960]   as you were going through
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.320]   the personal financial planner master's program.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.680]   Where did it go from there?
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.320]   - Once I was able to recognize the things in my own mind
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.040]   that had been tripping me up
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.640]   and keeping me from being comfortable with earning
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.480]   and managing money.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.240]   Then I was able to get my own finances under control.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.760]   But like I said, I wasn't really fascinated
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.440]   by the job of financial planner.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.080]   And a lot of people are, I'm not dismissing the job.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.080]   I got really curious at that point
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.000]   about what are the ways I know how I got in my own way.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.800]   But could I look at research in general
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.640]   on consumer psychology and look at how are the ways
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.920]   that we tend to systematically get in our own way?
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.440]   And you have to know, you have to remember
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.200]   that this is 2007, 2008, but I'm thinking about this
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.760]   and behavioral finance wasn't really a thing yet.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   And so this was just me off in my little bubble of my mind
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.560]   saying, look, I cannot be the only person
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.040]   who was smart and ambitious and motivated
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.400]   and fab with money because of unexamined beliefs
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.120]   that we're getting in my own way.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.360]   And so I decided I wanted to pursue a doctorate
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.920]   where I combined economics and psychology
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.520]   to really examine the psychological barriers
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.840]   to sound money management and look at,
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.360]   do a survey of the literature of what do we know
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.640]   about how we tend to get in our own way
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.400]   when it comes to money and then from there,
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.280]   how we can step out of our own way
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.600]   and iron out our relationship with money
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.880]   so that we can be better with it.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.840]   - You had this epiphany and you started
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.760]   really working on this and eventually you ended up
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.200]   at Morningstar, could you tell us about that?
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.000]   - Yes, when I left academia with this degree
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.640]   in psychology and economics where I had focused
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.920]   on the psychological barriers to sound money management
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.200]   and specifically financial education
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.560]   and a real passion to help other people like myself
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.880]   get out of their own way and get unstuck
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.880]   so that they could start using their resources
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.080]   to support the lives they want to live.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.800]   So I went to Morningstar because Morningstar
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.600]   had a subsidiary, Hello Wallet,
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.880]   which is a personal financial management application.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.600]   And the goal there was to try to teach people
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.320]   who were pre-investors in the saving
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.000]   or maybe even pre-saving stage of their financial life
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.920]   how to make those choices and focusing
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.520]   on trying to get people to think longer term,
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.640]   contribute to their savings and learn how to invest.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.440]   And so my career from there has taken a different arc
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.640]   than I had originally thought it would,
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.320]   but I'm still very focused on the principles
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.880]   of personal financial planning,
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.760]   really demystifying the complex,
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.200]   helping people realize that they can take control
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.720]   of their finances, that it's not too complex
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.680]   for them to be good enough at it,
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.040]   and also recognizing not just the simple things
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.360]   about money management that they need to know
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.960]   in order to manage it well,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.560]   but also how to maybe detect the things
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.840]   in their own mindset that could be tripping them up
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.840]   if they don't examine those.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.200]   And so this blend of basic money management principles
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.840]   combined with knowing yourself
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.720]   and that intersection between your mind
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.960]   and knowing money and how it works
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.120]   is that sweet spot for being really good with money.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.880]   - There are some studies that show that financial education,
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.840]   financial literacy doesn't work.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.600]   - There's a lot of mixed results
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.080]   when it comes to the success of financial education programs.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.600]   And some people will go so far
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.360]   as to say financial education doesn't work.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.160]   Well, I have to disagree with that
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.400]   because it's demonstrably true
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.600]   that when you know more about money,
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.520]   you do make better decisions with your money.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.120]   If learning about money didn't help us make better decisions
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.600]   then we'd all be sunk.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.080]   But what's also true is that if you learn an abstract concept
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.840]   and you have no way to apply it
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.280]   and it's not relevant to your life,
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.520]   you will forget it almost instantly.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.560]   And so most financial education transfers knowledge
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.360]   that is immediately forgotten.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.840]   And that's the problem is we're teaching a math class,
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.640]   we're not teaching a life skills class.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.800]   And I think we need to be speaking to people's minds,
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.760]   not to their wallets, for one thing,
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.240]   and talking about the financial decisions
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.120]   that matter to them.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.560]   So just in time financial education
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.120]   has been shown to have some really good results.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.880]   And financial advisors do just in time financial education
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.760]   because people come to you when they have a question,
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.320]   when they have a decision to make,
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.840]   they're ready to learn because it's relevant to them.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.600]   So just in time financial education is great.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.760]   But then where we get tripped up
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.040]   is that we start teaching the equations
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   and we start hitting people
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.800]   with the fire hose of information
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.040]   that just makes them shut down
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.640]   because they don't need to know the calculus.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.040]   - I completely agree that when someone is ready to learn
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.560]   that they learn a lot faster.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.600]   What I have found true after 30 some odd years of doing this
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.440]   is that the amount of money you have
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.480]   doesn't make you any more comfortable working with money.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.200]   I don't think that the level of wealth you have
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.600]   actually addresses the problems that people have.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.280]   - No, it definitely doesn't.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.240]   And I think that while mindset can contribute
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.400]   to whether or not you're able to do the things
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.920]   that help you build wealth,
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.320]   there is definitely certain factors of mindset
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.520]   that help you build wealth
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.760]   and certain factors of mindset
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.440]   that will stand in your way of building wealth.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.720]   But the other part of mindset that I think matters
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.400]   is just simply confidence.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.760]   Confidence with money, confidence with numbers,
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.680]   and just money is the most taboo topic of conversation
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.600]   in our culture.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.080]   More than sex, more than death, more than politics,
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.760]   we do not like to talk specifically about money.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.760]   - It is difficult for people.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.920]   The thing that's coming to mind is this program
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.400]   that I listened to where a woman had gone
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.000]   and she wanted to interview people about money
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.440]   and they were more than willing
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.520]   until she asked them to actually tell her
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.640]   how much they made.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.000]   And then people got so offended.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.920]   It's just something that we don't feel comfortable
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.040]   talking about.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.800]   And it may be that we find it uncouth.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.560]   It may be that we just don't understand it well enough
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.720]   to feel confident talking about it.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.680]   For whatever reason, we are pretty clammed up
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.120]   when it comes to talking about money.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.160]   And the result is that most of us end up
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.600]   with a pretty poor excuse for a financial education.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.080]   And so we are left to try to figure all this stuff out
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.320]   on our own.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.840]   And you can be incredibly educated, very smart,
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.160]   very successful, high earner, high net worth,
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.400]   and still not understand the basics
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.760]   and mechanics of money.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.240]   And at that point, it can be very embarrassing
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.640]   to even mention to someone,
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.560]   who are you gonna tell?
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.200]   Who are you gonna ask for help?
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.960]   Financial planners, I think, know very well
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.400]   that one of their biggest jobs is financial education.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.640]   But I think that we really underestimate
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.240]   the level of financial illiteracy,
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.280]   even among very talented, smart, educated,
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.080]   and successful people.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.680]   - Let me just tell you a story in this.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.560]   I've been a financial advisor for more than 30 years.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.880]   And it amazes me when this happens,
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.400]   but it happens much more frequently
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.920]   than I would have ever expected.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.640]   By the way, as a financial advisor,
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.880]   there's an old saying
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.720]   that if you really wanna get to know somebody,
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.760]   you either marry them or manage their money.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.600]   One of them.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.440]   (laughs)
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.080]   And people tell you things.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.760]   But I think one of the most interesting things for me
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.520]   in my career as a financial advisor
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.240]   is the amount of very wealthy people who say to me,
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   do I have enough to retire?
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.000]   Do you think I have enough to retire or can I retire?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.880]   And these are not people who don't have a lot of money.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.880]   I mean, these people have five, $10 million or more.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.560]   They're spending maybe $100,000 a year, maybe.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.040]   And the first few times I heard this,
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.840]   I was taken back.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.600]   I would say to myself, can't you do the math?
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.840]   I mean, if you've got $10 million
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.920]   and only spending $100,000 a year,
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.960]   I mean, you gotta live 100 years
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.000]   if you had made no income, spend all of that money.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.840]   I do the math and I said, well, let's look at it.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.560]   You've got the X amount of money,
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.520]   let's divide it by how much you spend it.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.520]   And that's how many years this thing will last.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.440]   And they say to me, and I'm just amazed in this,
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.520]   but I hear it all the time.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.320]   God, I never looked at it that way.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.560]   Yeah, I mean, I really never thought about it that way.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.120]   You know, to me, it's like, wow, really?
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.920]   You've never thought about it that way?
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.000]   - How did you not do this very simple equation?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.440]   Well, the reason they didn't do it
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.560]   is because no one ever taught them how.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.840]   And we know how bad we are
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.280]   at understanding compound interest, right?
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.800]   We just don't think that way.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.120]   But I think we are really, really bad
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.560]   at mental math in general.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.960]   And a lot of people also are just afraid of numbers.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.840]   They just think they are not good with numbers.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.880]   Once you give them an equation, it's like white noise.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.720]   They just stop, stop thinking, stop listening.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.560]   They don't wanna run the numbers.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.720]   But one thing that has been shown over and over
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.840]   is the typical person is pretty bad
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   at translating a lump sum into an annuitized income.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.640]   We're really bad at knowing that relationship.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.920]   You know what they need is a rule of thumb.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.480]   And I know rules of thumb,
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.840]   I heard on one of your previous podcasts,
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.440]   you were saying, "I'm always up against rules of thumb.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.040]   "People come in to my office with rules of thumb
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.320]   "and I need to like fix the rules of thumb in their head."
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.360]   And the wrong rule of thumb can be very dangerous,
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.920]   but the right rule of thumb in the right circumstances
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.400]   can be an incredible cognitive device.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.080]   And so the general idea of a rule of thumb,
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.960]   it's a big idea.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.840]   You learn it's flexible knowledge.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.280]   You can use it in lots of different circumstances.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.520]   It's different from an equation
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.120]   because an equation you need to really know
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.040]   when do you use that formula?
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.320]   What are all the inputs?
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.080]   How do you do it exactly?
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.960]   The rule of thumb,
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.440]   you can bring into lots of different scenarios.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.200]   I'm trying to think of just what's a really good,
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.880]   simple rule of thumb for people.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.440]   - Your agent bonds.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   - Yeah, you know, something like that.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.680]   It's not exact.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.280]   Obviously it's not optimized.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.040]   It's a starting point and it's a conversation starter.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.360]   - Yeah, usually I started by saying ignore it.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.280]   So it does come up.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.640]   And when it does come up, I say,
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.720]   "Well, let's talk about why that doesn't apply to you."
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.520]   But at least it's a starting point.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.000]   - So a rule of thumb I love is the rule of 72.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.960]   And the reason I love the rule of 72,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.560]   you have to understand why we invest.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.680]   And we invest because really rough rule of thumb,
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.000]   but using the rule of 72 under 3% inflation
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.440]   costs double every 25 years.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.160]   Your lifestyle will cost double
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.600]   what it does today in 25 years.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.680]   - But before we go there,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.040]   let's just define what the rule of 72 is.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.600]   - Yeah, so the rule of 72
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.480]   is this great little mathematical phenomena
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.760]   that if you take a growth rate or a shrinking rate,
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.960]   a growth rate or a diminishing rate,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.960]   you divide 72 by the growth rate
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.040]   and that gives you the number of years
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.600]   that it will take for an amount to double.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.960]   It really just comes down to,
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.960]   there are a few simple concepts about how money works
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.560]   that most people don't learn.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.400]   - Well, the way that we used to talk about the rule of 72
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.760]   back in the good old days was that
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.600]   if you get a 10% return on your money compounded,
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.800]   it will take 7.2 years to double.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.400]   Or if you get a 7.2% rate of return on your money,
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.960]   it'll take 10 years to double.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.440]   So it's like one or the other.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.880]   But that was in the good old days
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.640]   when of course everything went up by 12 or 13% a year.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.440]   - Right, I mean, it's flexible, right?
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.920]   So you can use the rule of 72
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.840]   to teach the impact of inflation on the cost of living.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.080]   72 divided by three is about 24 point something.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.120]   That means that prices double roughly every 25 years,
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.960]   every 24 point something years.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.680]   And so why do we invest?
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.760]   Because we want to beat inflation.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.680]   Not because we want to beat our neighbor
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.440]   or because we want to beat the market,
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.720]   but because we want our money to, at the very least,
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.760]   maintain its value, if not grow in value over time.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.040]   That's why you have to invest.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.560]   That's why saving alone is not enough
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.320]   because the dollar's value is constantly being eroded.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.160]   - Of course, if you believe that there's going to be
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.760]   a 2% inflation rate, which is the Federal Reserve target,
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.760]   then you take two into 72 and you're at 36.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.560]   - 36, okay, it's not as bad.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.720]   - Well, it becomes really important
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   if you want to retire early, say in your fifties,
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.320]   and what is the amount that I can withdraw
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.080]   off of my portfolio to live happily ever after?
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.600]   You do have to do this calculation to say,
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.080]   well, you want to live off of $80,000 a year now,
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.960]   you'll be needing $160,000 a year
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.520]   by the time you're in your eighties
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.280]   to have the same spending.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.920]   Now, I wouldn't know, it's questionable whether or not
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.000]   people actually have the same spending
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.440]   when they're in their eighties.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.680]   - Right, and again, the exactness of the math,
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.200]   I think when someone is hiring a financial advisor,
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.800]   a lot of times they want the advisor
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.760]   to do the exact math for them,
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.280]   but giving them the rule of thumb
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.240]   so they can understand the concept,
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.720]   so they can understand the general macro movements
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.600]   that are happening with their money,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.960]   I think really helps them get a sense
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.760]   of knowing what's going on.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.960]   You can do the equations that get down to the nitty gritty,
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.240]   but showing them the general relationship
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.920]   between time and money as it relates to cost of living,
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.200]   and also as it relates to compound interest,
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.800]   helps them understand why we're doing what we're doing
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.520]   and why we're translating something to a future value
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.840]   rather than the present value.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.920]   Why we care so much about inflation.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.280]   Why do these things matter?
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.320]   Because they really affect the bottom line
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.080]   of what you need to save in order to be prepared
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.320]   to maintain your lifestyle.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.440]   - I'm gonna circle back a little bit.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.320]   You talked about having a mindset to build wealth.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.200]   So this idea of how much you need
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.800]   to have a sustainable retirement is one part of it
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.080]   and getting people to understand how inflation works
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.600]   and how much money that is
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.760]   and how much they need to save and so forth.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   What other mindsets do people need to build wealth?
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.400]   - We each tend to have a mental time horizon.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.440]   So I'm not talking about your financial time horizon,
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.840]   just your mental time horizon.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.400]   When you think about your money,
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:15.080]   how far into the future do you tend to think and plan?
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.520]   And a lot of people who are investing,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.840]   especially long-term investors,
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.040]   they're thinking 20 or 30 years ahead.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.960]   And that's one of the reasons why they are long-term investors
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.280]   because they have a long-term mindset.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.160]   But many, many, many people don't think more
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.920]   than a few months ahead.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.040]   And then other people think just about a year ahead.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.520]   When I did a survey, I've done several of these surveys
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.920]   and what I find is that a good 70% of people
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.080]   are thinking less than 10 years ahead
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.280]   when they think about their money.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.160]   Less than 10 years ahead,
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.760]   majority of people, about 70% of people.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.360]   What I found was this almost one-to-one relationship
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.760]   where the further ahead people were thinking
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.040]   when it came to money,
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.200]   the more money they had accumulated.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.800]   And this relationship was still significant
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.360]   when I controlled for age, for income,
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.600]   for financial education and financial literacy.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.600]   The point here was that the people who,
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.640]   there was like a breaking point.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.040]   When people who thought 10 years or more ahead
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.000]   had 10 times more saved.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.360]   - Oh, that's interesting, wow.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.320]   - Yeah, and what was really interesting
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.080]   was breaking the results up by income group.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.520]   For example, I had a group of people
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.360]   who were making less than $25,000 a year.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.680]   But those who were thinking more than 10 years ahead
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.960]   had several times their annual income already saved.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.040]   But then the people who were thinking
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.760]   less than 10 years ahead
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.600]   needed to be making well into six figures
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.280]   before they were even saving significantly.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.680]   And so what was really interesting
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.840]   is that yes, income matters.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.000]   If you just look at savings by income,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.280]   yes, people who have higher income do save more.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.760]   But if you break that down and you say,
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.120]   okay, now within each income group,
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.480]   the people who are thinking far into the future
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.080]   versus the shorter term thinkers,
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.480]   short-term thinkers don't save as much.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.120]   Long-term thinkers save significantly more
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.160]   in every income group, every income group.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   And so income matters, but mindset matters more.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.320]   - We talked about understanding
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.960]   how inflation can affect what you have.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.720]   That's a long-term outlook.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.080]   I mean, I just don't think people who think about inflation
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.960]   and really work it into their equation for retirement,
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.440]   they have to be looking out more than 10 years.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.080]   So it's sort of like they go together in a way.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.400]   - Yes, in order to be considering it in the first place.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.920]   Like I said, people who are investors
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.120]   are probably already, especially long-term investors,
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.320]   are probably already long-term thinkers.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.200]   Now let's think about the case of a person
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.840]   who's an investor, but a short-term thinker.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.760]   What kind of investor do you think
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.240]   that person is more likely to be?
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.920]   - A Robin Hood investor.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.680]   - They're more likely to be speculating
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.040]   and trying to get rich fast.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.600]   They're gonna take on more risk
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.560]   because there's a link between our mental time horizon
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.240]   and our discount rate and our patience.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.680]   And if you don't, if you're a short-term thinker,
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.400]   and I say this as someone who,
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.760]   I am naturally a very short-term thinker.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.840]   One of the things I learned
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.280]   is that some of the root of my own mismanagement of money,
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.160]   yes, there's the emotional stuff around money,
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.520]   but I also was a very short-term thinker.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.200]   And so short-term thinkers have special challenges
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.080]   when it comes to building wealth.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.280]   And we have to be very, very deliberate and conscious
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.880]   about retraining our minds
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.920]   because having a short-term mindset
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.000]   leads to more impulsiveness, less patience.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.360]   You're gonna be more likely to take on higher debt lows,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.560]   less likely to save, more likely to overspend.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.880]   And when you do invest,
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.120]   you're gonna be more risk-seeking
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.760]   because you're impatient about the returns.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.680]   And so I think that if there were one aspect of mindset
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.320]   that is really the wealth killer, it's short-term thinking.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.320]   And we tend to be either short-term or long-term thinkers,
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.520]   but it's not a trait level thing.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.240]   It's not character level.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.360]   It's more like they're malleable.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.600]   They're not always easy to change, but they are malleable.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.640]   You can retrain them over time.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.080]   And so if you're a short-term thinker,
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.960]   training yourself to think longer and longer term
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.080]   is probably the best bottom line,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.560]   best thing you could do for yourself and your money.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.760]   - Let me talk again about conversations
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.480]   that I have with clients.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.200]   When I run into this short-term thinking
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   about investing mindset,
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.640]   I tend to talk with people about their careers
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.480]   at that point.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.280]   I said, you know, you are a physician
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.760]   or an engineer or a something.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.640]   And it wasn't as though you just got up this morning
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.480]   and decided I'm gonna be a doctor,
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.080]   I'm gonna be an engineer,
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.000]   I'm gonna be a lawyer or whatever.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.600]   You had to plan this
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.640]   and you had to do it for a long period of time
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.280]   to go to undergrad, go to grad school,
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.560]   medical school, law school,
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.400]   whatever it is that you did.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.320]   And you wanted to get a job with a company
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.400]   where you were able to use your skills
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.840]   and do something great for the world and so forth.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.600]   And this was a very long-term plan of yours
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.360]   that had been going on for years and years and years.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.560]   And generally people will agree with that.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.560]   That's correct.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.480]   Then at that point I say,
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.080]   well, you know, investing is many ways the same way.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.800]   It's not like you could decide tomorrow
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.240]   you're going to be a value investor or a growth investor,
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.880]   or maybe you're gonna get out of the market.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.360]   That's not how it works.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.600]   You have to look at investing
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.080]   just like you look at your career.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.280]   It takes years and decades
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.760]   to get to where it is you want to go.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.560]   And I think that formulating
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.520]   or trying to make a connection
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.920]   between how long it takes to build a career
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.640]   and to become successful in a career
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.600]   to investing in the markets,
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.840]   I think helps to stretch out
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.320]   that timeframe that you're speaking about.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.160]   That mental time.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.040]   You said expectations that, you know,
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.560]   we're not expecting that if you're a good investor,
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.000]   you're going to have a thousand percent return
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.920]   in the first five years.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.480]   We're looking at a thousand percent return
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.880]   over a 25 year period.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.600]   One study that was done showed that people with,
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.240]   you know, more impulsive people,
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.920]   actually time, actually the pain of waiting is greater.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.840]   Time does actually seem to take longer.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.920]   So inpatient people literally pay
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.240]   a higher psychological cost for waiting
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.320]   than patient people.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.920]   And so to me, I think it kind of throws a wrench
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.280]   in the works of the idea of us being irrational
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.880]   because actually what's happening
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.320]   is there's a mental cost benefit analysis going on
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.360]   and people who are short-term thinkers
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.560]   pay a higher cost for waiting.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.000]   And so therefore their utility equation is totally different
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.560]   from a person who is patient
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.080]   and doesn't feel pain
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.000]   or as much pain when needing to wait.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.800]   So when you have a short-term thinking investor,
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.920]   an investor who has a short-term mindset
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.760]   or is just a short-term thinker,
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.680]   you have to be prepared to deal with all the complications
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.600]   that come with the impulsiveness, the impatience,
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.520]   and the risk seeking
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.360]   that goes along with short-term thinking.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.320]   And if you have a long-term thinker,
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.960]   those are the people who are just naturally inclined
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.800]   to be long-term value investors.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.080]   And so they're not gonna give you any trouble.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.320]   It's the short-term thinkers
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.080]   who first have a hard time getting wealth in the first place
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.240]   and then when they get it,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.440]   they have a hard time holding onto it.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.800]   - So I've seen some studies on this.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.600]   Are women better at this than men?
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.520]   - Are women better at this than men?
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.000]   Okay, there are some studies that seem to suggest
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.120]   that women tend to have a longer term,
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.080]   tend to tend toward a longer term view.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.440]   I don't know that I'm really bought in yet.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.240]   I haven't seen enough to really prove to me
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.640]   that women and men are fundamentally different
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.880]   when it comes to investing.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   I do think that if there's any research that I've seen
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.480]   that I find meaningful in this area,
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.520]   it's again in the financial education research.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.560]   What we know about financial literacy and gender
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.240]   is that women score lower on financial literacy tests
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.040]   than men do globally.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.920]   But there's an interesting caveat.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.160]   In all these financial literacy questions,
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.840]   they ask the big five
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.240]   or the big three financial literacy questions,
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.400]   which you can look up, they're the same around the world.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.360]   But the big five and the big three
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.440]   allow you to say, "I don't know,"
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.800]   as an option for every question.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.960]   And if you say, "I don't know,"
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.640]   you will get the question wrong.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.840]   So women have lower financial literacy scores,
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.120]   but are more likely to say they don't know.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.800]   - Well, I know that.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.840]   Men know it.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.000]   I know the answer.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.560]   I mean, that's clear.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.960]   I mean, a man is not gonna say they don't know.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.640]   I mean, we're men.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.680]   - But it's interesting that culturally,
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.200]   the willingness to admit not knowing,
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.880]   and women are also,
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.320]   there's some research that I've seen recently
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.000]   saying that some older women
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.120]   are more likely to seek out financial advisors
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.160]   and admit that they need help there.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.360]   And so women may be better investors,
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:02.080]   partly because of a cultural acceptability
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.080]   of being able to say, "I don't know, help me out."
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.840]   - Well, look, I'd like to get into your book a little bit
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.400]   because you've got some really interesting information
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.080]   and loaded money psychology
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.640]   and how to get ahead without leaving your values behind.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.800]   And this goes with Maslow's "Higher Order of Needs."
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   And you've taken this concept
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.520]   and you've broken it down to personal finance.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.120]   I found it fascinating.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.800]   Can you go through it with us?
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.320]   - Yeah, most of what I've studied
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.200]   and where my knowledge lies
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.680]   is in the area of learning about money
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   and financial education, financial literacy.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.840]   And so often when in the programs that we have
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.600]   that teach us about money,
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.480]   there is a common trope that we hear in
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.120]   when it comes to budgeting.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.000]   And that is, you could probably finish the sentence for me.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.320]   You have to know the difference between a want and--
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.800]   - A need.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.280]   - A need, right?
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.320]   You can hear your grade school teacher saying,
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.440]   "Okay, to make good financial decisions,
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.400]   you have to know the difference between a want and a need."
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.360]   And I hear this all the time in financial education circles
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.760]   and it makes my skin crawl
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.000]   because the reality is
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.040]   that if we really wanna go down that logical route,
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.520]   then what we're saying is,
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.160]   if you don't need it to survive,
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.920]   you can't justify spending money on it.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.080]   And I think that's absolutely bogus.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.800]   When you think about Maslow's hierarchy, right?
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.200]   It is not Maslow's hierarchy of wants.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.360]   It's Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.640]   Yes, they're a hierarchy.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.640]   Yes, you care more about survival
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.960]   than you do about your emotional wellbeing.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.800]   And yet, there are times when we flip
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.720]   that hierarchy on its head.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.240]   Anytime somebody texts while driving,
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.920]   they're putting their need for connection
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.160]   ahead of their need for safety.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.040]   Anytime that somebody goes out,
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.760]   instead of putting gas in their car,
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.800]   they go out for beers with their friends.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.080]   They're putting their need for friendship and for fun
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.320]   ahead of their need for transportation.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.840]   We will flip these all the time.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.280]   And the fact is that they're all needs.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.720]   What really revolutionized money management,
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.880]   personal money management for me,
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.360]   was realizing that all of the things
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.320]   that we do with our money,
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.160]   whether it's paying our mortgage
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.840]   or buying a pack of stickers
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.360]   at a checkout line for our kid,
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.440]   and even the impulsive decisions,
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.520]   every one of them can be traced back
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.520]   to an attempt to meet one of the fundamental human needs.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.800]   And all of those can be found on Maslow's hierarchy.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.760]   So yes, I can survive without friendship
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.520]   and love and meaning and spiritual fulfillment.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.640]   I can survive without those things.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.320]   Do I want to?
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.280]   No.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.120]   So I don't think we should make money management
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.960]   about only budgeting for the things
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.120]   that are down at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.640]   What that is basically doing
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.680]   is turning budgeting into an exercise
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.560]   in how we're going to feel bad.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.800]   Here's how I'm going to deprive myself
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.560]   of the things that I really want in my life, right?
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.520]   That's why budgeting feels like a diet.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.680]   That's why people hate it.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.880]   That's why people make a budget and then can't stick to it
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.880]   because they're budgeting based on this definition of need
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.480]   that if you don't need it to survive,
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.640]   you can't justify spending money on it.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.800]   And I think that makes for very unhappy people,
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.120]   very unfulfilling lives.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.680]   And we will not stick to a budget.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.720]   Like, yes, yes, the numbers need to work,
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.960]   but your life needs to work too.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.240]   And so the goal I think of healthy money management
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.280]   is not recognizing the difference between a want and a need.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.600]   I think that's the wrong framework.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.800]   We need to recognize the difference between a need
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.240]   and a need can be found on Maslow's hierarchy.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.040]   The needs are all human needs.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.800]   They're universal human needs.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.120]   We all need to matter.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.360]   We all need to belong.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.520]   We all need a connection and intimacy and solitude
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.800]   and shelter and food and clothing.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.240]   But we need all of these things
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.360]   in order to thrive as human beings.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.680]   And if we only meet our physical needs
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.240]   at the expense of our emotional and social
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.320]   and spiritual needs, we will be unfulfilled people.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.600]   And so we don't wanna plan our financial lives
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.600]   in such a way that sets us up to be unfulfilled people.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.840]   That's not the point of money management.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.760]   That makes the numbers work at the expense of yourself.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.280]   But instead, what we want is we want to be more
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.560]   fully conscious when we plan our budget to say,
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.240]   how will I meet all of my needs?
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.680]   My need for connection, my need for a social life,
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.680]   my need for fun, my need for belonging
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.880]   and my need for food, shelter and clothing
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.200]   within the confines of my available resources.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.000]   And yes, it's a harder problem to solve,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.600]   but you're gonna get a better answer on the other side.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.920]   You'll end up with a budget that you can keep
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.520]   and not only a budget that you can keep,
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.120]   but one that allows you to enjoy your life now
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.280]   and in the future.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.920]   It's not an exercise in depriving yourself now
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.400]   so that you can enjoy your life in the future.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.880]   It's how do you live the most fulfilling life now
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.600]   and in the future?
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.400]   And that's why I think we need to recognize
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.680]   that Maslow's hierarchy tells us
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.440]   all of the things that a human needs.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.760]   We need self-actualization
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.240]   as well as food, shelter and clothing.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.600]   And so if our budgets aren't allowing us
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.520]   to be driving for and achieving self-actualization now,
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.200]   that's not the right budget for us.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.040]   - Yeah, it's great.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:49.920]   Good stuff.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.760]   You know, it's funny.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.440]   I talk with a lot of retirees and they say,
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.200]   "Well, things get tight and the market goes down.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.640]   "We just won't spend as much money.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.280]   "We just won't go on vacation anymore
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.360]   "or go out to eat anymore
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.880]   "or get a nice bottle of wine anymore."
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.480]   And I said, "Oh, well, I don't know if that's true or not."
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.920]   But what you're saying is it's not
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.280]   because you'll become immediately depressed
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.120]   by not doing those things.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.360]   - Right, right.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.040]   And the thing that's really interesting
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.880]   is once you start to work with your budget,
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.200]   and I make some suggestions in the book
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.520]   of how to do a budgeting exercise
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.840]   where you're reducing expenses
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.920]   while increasing life satisfaction.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.800]   And that's the real beauty of it
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.560]   is being able to come up with a budget
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.560]   that meets all of your needs
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.760]   so that you're really satisfied and thriving
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.720]   without sabotaging your ability.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.760]   Like one of your needs is long-term solvency.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.240]   So you can't meet your need for long-term solvency
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:46.080]   at the expense of short-term happiness,
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.160]   but you also can't have short-term happiness
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.840]   at the expense of long-term solvency.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.440]   You have to find solutions where both needs get met.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.120]   And it is possible.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.320]   It just takes some practice
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.800]   and a bit of deeper, different kind of thinking
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.840]   than we're used to when we just make a list of expenses
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.000]   and make a list of income and expenses.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:09.840]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.680]   The name of the book is called
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.560]   "Loaded Money Psychology and How to Get Ahead
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.800]   "Without Leaving Your Values Behind."
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.920]   Sarah, I got a couple more questions for you.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.520]   And I run into this all the time,
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.440]   and it is with people who just can't stop working.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:28.440]   They just continue to feel like they have to work,
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.080]   even though they know they have enough money,
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.960]   even though they know they can retire.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.800]   They still put in 50, 60 hours a week.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.400]   They do wanna cut back, but they can't cut back.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.360]   They just feel like if they cut back,
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.240]   the whole world is gonna collapse.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.040]   They're going to lose all their money.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.080]   What, first of all, what is this called?
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.760]   - I like to call them the worried wealthy.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.000]   - Okay.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.720]   And how do you solve this problem?
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.880]   Because I run into it quite often.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.240]   - I worked on a framework a year or so back
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.920]   on financial mindset.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.840]   And what I was really trying to drive at
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.120]   is a model that can sort of place people
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.920]   in how healthy is your financial mindset?
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.640]   And there were a couple of key factors
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:14.080]   that contributed to financial well-being.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.000]   First of all, you gotta understand
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.920]   that there's two axes to financial well-being.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.720]   Economic, so yes, you have to have assets,
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.320]   but there's also the emotional aspect
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.000]   of financial well-being.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.080]   And so if you think about this as an X, Y axis,
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.080]   you can have people that are very high on the economic part,
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.920]   but low on emotional well-being.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.680]   So they're stressed, they're worried,
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.200]   they're anxious, they feel helpless,
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.960]   but they have plenty of assets.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.480]   And you can also have people on the other extreme
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.800]   that are feeling completely satisfied and happy
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.480]   and carefree, but they have no assets at all.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.880]   And both of those extremes are unhealthy.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.240]   One, because you're at risk
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.840]   of complete catastrophic financial failure
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.880]   if you have no solvency and you're carefree about it.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.760]   And two, if you have plenty of economic stability,
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.160]   but no life satisfaction, what good is your money anyway?
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.480]   So the goal of wealth is not to be wealthy.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.480]   The goal of wealth is to be happy.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.160]   I mean, I love Brian Portnoy's "Funded Contentment."
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.560]   That's what it's all about.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.280]   So if you don't have the contentment,
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.280]   even once you have the funding, there's something wrong.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.160]   So I like to refer to this as the worried wealthy.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:33.560]   These are people who would be high on the economic scale,
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.120]   low on the wellbeing scale.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.280]   And the drivers that I have found are really linked
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.120]   to the emotional side of financial wellbeing
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.480]   are two things.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.120]   Number one is locus of control.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.280]   And that's just a scientific way of saying,
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.200]   where do you believe the control in your life is centered?
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.000]   So people who have an internal locus of control
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.640]   are the people who say, I create my financial destiny.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.200]   I'm in the driver's seat.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.080]   I can make it happen.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.920]   I'm the one in control.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.280]   People with an external locus of control
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.080]   believe that forces outside themselves
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.160]   control their financial future and wellbeing.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.480]   Imagine a graph where you've got people grouped
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:19.640]   in different income groups from like 25,000 a year
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.800]   all the way up to 150 plus a year.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.360]   And you just ask them,
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.280]   which statement do you most agree with?
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.200]   Either I control my financial destiny
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.760]   or I have very little control over my financial future.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.160]   So I asked people to tell me which statement
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.880]   they most agreed with.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.680]   And then I looked at their emotional wellbeing
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.720]   with respect to money.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:50.240]   So how often were they feeling stressed, angry,
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.680]   sad or helpless?
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.760]   How often were they feeling joy, peace,
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.080]   satisfaction and pride with respect to their money?
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.840]   And what I found was across the board,
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.800]   people who feel that they are in control
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.920]   of their financial future were generally feeling
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.000]   pretty good about their finances,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.920]   regardless of which income group they were in,
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.160]   they felt more positive than negative emotions
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.520]   with respect to money.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.800]   But regardless of income,
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.880]   people who felt that external forces
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.760]   were really in the driver's seat of their financial life,
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.760]   it didn't matter how much money they were making,
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.720]   they were feeling more stress than peace,
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.600]   more depression than satisfaction,
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.720]   more helplessness than pride, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.360]   - And this had nothing to do with how much wealth
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.160]   they actually had.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.800]   - Yeah, this was just whether or not they felt
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.320]   they were in the driver's seat
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.160]   of their own financial future or not.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.480]   So this sense of being able to,
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.520]   having a sense of personal control
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.680]   over your own financial life.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.600]   And you see this in entrepreneurs.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.080]   They can make millions, lose millions and bounce back.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:02.920]   And what do they say?
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.880]   I did it once, I can do it again.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.800]   And they're right.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.680]   They believe they can go and do it again
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.200]   because that's an internal locus of control.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.360]   Whereas the people who are the worried wealthy,
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.720]   they feel out of control.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.600]   They're what if thinking.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.200]   There are so many what ifs that go on in their mind.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.480]   And the thing is, the things we can scare ourselves with,
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.320]   there's no amount of money that can make you feel safe
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.800]   if you're gonna what if yourself all the time.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.640]   - Interesting.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.800]   I speak with a lot of physicians
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.160]   and a lot of them are always worried about
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.200]   Medicare repayment and the health of the medical industry.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.880]   And they're worried so much of that.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.320]   It really kind of surprises me.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.920]   But now the way you explain it.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.040]   - Their attention, yeah.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.480]   Their attention is on what they can't control.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.320]   - That's correct, yeah.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.480]   - Large macro trends that they can't control.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.560]   And if your attention is focused
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.880]   on the things you can't control, you will feel worried.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.440]   But if your attention is focused
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.280]   on the things that you can control,
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.600]   you'll feel more peaceful.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   Or alternately, if you can do what Jim Grubman calls
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.200]   turning the what if into a so what.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.480]   Where you say, okay, what if it really did
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.840]   all go down the toilet?
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.960]   What would you do then?
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.160]   Let's talk about that.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.800]   What would we do?
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.120]   And sometimes getting people to take that extra step
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:23.640]   past the big nebulous catastrophe in their mind
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.440]   to, okay, let's assume that happened.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:28.280]   Let's assume it all went away.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.200]   What would you do?
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   - Right, good point.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.360]   - How would you rebuild?
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.320]   Where would you go?
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.720]   And one of the things that I think is really comforting
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.720]   for people when they do this exercise is to recognize
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.600]   that the thing that really matters to them
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.840]   is that even if they lost all their money,
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.600]   the people who loved them would still love them.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.440]   - Yes, correct.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.720]   - I know that that sounds really simplistic,
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.640]   but it's so real.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.520]   So much of what we're really afraid of losing
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.440]   is our sense of belonging.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.960]   - Let me ask one last question and wrap it up today.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.360]   We're in the middle of COVID.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.800]   We have a lot of young people who are just getting started
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.960]   who have lost their job, can't find jobs.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.520]   Or they fear losing their job.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.320]   They fear that the economy is not coming back.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.240]   But they're out there, they're working at this.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.240]   What kind of advice would you give to them?
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.840]   - I would say, honestly,
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.920]   if you're looking at a 40, 50 year time horizon,
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:22.840]   you are looking at being on the cusp
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.760]   of an entirely new economy.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.600]   How is that not extremely exciting?
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.040]   A lot of uncertainty, but also very exciting.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.200]   And I think as hard as it is to trust your gut
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   when you're young, I think really,
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.400]   if you're looking on, if you're on the job market
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.760]   or you're thinking about,
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.280]   what do you wanna do for a career?
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.200]   Or how do you want, if you're just starting investing,
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.240]   this is an interesting time.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.080]   There's a lot that we don't know right now,
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:54.720]   but we do know a few things on the very macro level.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.000]   And we know the economy of 30 years from now
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.760]   must be lower carbon.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:05.760]   So investment decisions and career decisions
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:11.120]   and real estate purchase decisions and things like that.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.880]   I mean, we're at a point, a moment in history
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.840]   where there are a couple things that we can say
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.640]   we know about the future economy.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.560]   And I think that makes it a very exciting time
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.000]   to be a long-term investor,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   whether you're investing in a career or assets.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.600]   But in terms of the day-to-day,
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.520]   what do I do to make ends meet right now?
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:37.520]   I think that we need to relax the pressure
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:42.520]   we put on ourselves to be hugely independent at all times.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.440]   And right now is a time when people are coming together
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:48.640]   and family groups are helping support each other
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.560]   and friend groups are coming together to support each other.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.440]   And I think that the economics of communities
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.840]   is gonna become more and more something
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.440]   that we hear about and think about.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.280]   So I would say, look to your community,
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:05.640]   your social and economic network,
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:10.600]   and be looking for how you can contribute to that
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:15.600]   and make that both efficient, but also satisfying.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.760]   Because I think it's our small communities and tribes
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:24.760]   that are gonna see us through this really weird time.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.600]   - Well, Sarah, thank you for contributing
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.680]   to the Bogleheads community with your wisdom
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.520]   and your experience.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   It's been a really interesting discussion
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.920]   and I greatly appreciate you being on the show.
