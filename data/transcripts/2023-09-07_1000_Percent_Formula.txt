[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.360]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.000]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.500]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I'm your host.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.860]   And in today's podcast, I would like to share with you
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.040]   a concept that has been extremely helpful to me
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.080]   throughout my life called the 1000% formula.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.600]   This is something that I first learned in high school
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.540]   from Brian Tracy, who was one of my mentors
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.120]   that I listened to for many, many years.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.120]   And I found this to be such a practical and useful outline
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.120]   that I've just never been able to get away from it.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.060]   I've mentioned this repeatedly in podcasts
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.800]   and sometimes I'll get a question from a listener saying,
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.700]   "Hey, what was that podcast that Joshua talked about,
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.400]   "the 1000% formula?"
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.560]   And in the past, I didn't have a standalone podcast for that.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.540]   It's buried in, I talk about it in many of my courses,
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.360]   I talk about it in various podcasts,
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.100]   but I wanted to create a standalone podcast for you
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.400]   to teach you the 1000% formula.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.900]   Now, again, I learned this from Brian Tracy.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.520]   His version was somewhat close to my version,
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.320]   but I've taken it, I've modified it
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.400]   and adapted it to my own needs over the years.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.880]   And I want to share it with you now.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.060]   The basic idea of the 1000% formula
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.840]   is that small daily increases in productivity,
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.100]   repeated consistently,
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.480]   can lead to dramatic improvements over time.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.740]   The way that Brian would ask the question would be to say,
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.400]   "Could you, if you really wanted to,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.420]   "could you increase your productivity,
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.540]   "your performance, your output,
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.080]   "and your effectiveness and your work in business today
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.300]   "by a mere 1/10 of 1%?
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.140]   "Could you get 1/10 of 1% better?"
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.140]   Well, I confess that I certainly could today
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.140]   get 1/10 of 1%.
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.540]   And I believe that you also could get 1/10 of 1% better,
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.980]   more productive, higher performance, more effective, et cetera
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.420]   in your work and in your business today if you wanted to.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.260]   And I think that that can be repeated over time.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.100]   Well, if you do the math,
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.260]   1/10 of 1% improvement per day
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.940]   leads to 1/2 of 1% improvement per week.
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.880]   Over time, that makes about a 2% improvement per month
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.940]   and winds up being about a 26% improvement over the year
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.700]   if we use four-week months.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.840]   And that's about 1,000% improvement
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.620]   in the course of a decade
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.960]   knowing how these things compound.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.100]   Don't get too bogged down in the specific numbers.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.900]   The idea is that 1/10 of 1% per day
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.020]   repeated over a five-day workweek consistently
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.060]   over the years allows you to be about 1,000%
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.120]   more productive, more effective in your work life.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.060]   Now, if you wind up being more effective, more productive,
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.340]   then in a capitalist system, in the fullness of time,
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.020]   your own personal effectiveness
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.540]   will be recognized by higher income.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.580]   And so I think that if you're 1,000% better
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.420]   at your job and at your income,
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.980]   then there's a good chance that you'll be able to command
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.060]   a 10 times higher wage, 1,000% higher wage.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.000]   It's not automatic, it's not linear.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.540]   You have to do some significant career advancement moves
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.540]   in order to fully realize the value of this plan.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.900]   But the foundation is in what you do.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.900]   If you wanna make more money,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.060]   you have to begin by becoming more valuable.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.420]   And so how do you do that?
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.080]   Well, step one is reading.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.900]   Every day, you get up at least two hours
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.660]   before you have to be somewhere every day,
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.620]   and you invest the first hour into yourself
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.780]   by reading something that is uplifting,
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.740]   educational, motivational, spiritual,
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.180]   something that's going to help you and improve you
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.180]   and give you ideas and concepts, inspiration in your life.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.980]   As Tracy puts it,
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.160]   "Reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body."
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.780]   Reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.140]   And so what's cool is that if you spend
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.600]   about one hour a day reading a book,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.420]   by the way, this should include and can include
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.740]   reading a book with your ears,
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.700]   it doesn't only have to be with your eyes,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.220]   but if you spend about an hour a day reading a book,
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.740]   then you'll read on average about a book a week.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.780]   If you read on average about a book a week,
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.340]   you'll read on average about 50 books per year.
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.620]   If you go and you look at the world of academia,
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.300]   a formal advanced degree, a doctoral degree,
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.940]   a master's degree, et cetera,
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.900]   will often require you to read and absorb
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.620]   and synthesize something around 30 to 50 books
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.520]   and then write a dissertation on those books.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.420]   And so if you do this per year,
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.020]   you're getting the equivalent of about a master's degree
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.620]   or a doctoral degree of information, training, et cetera,
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.820]   in your field every single year.
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.460]   Now, I think that you should have a deeper strategy,
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.580]   which I won't go into here,
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.220]   but the basic idea behind what you choose to read
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.140]   is that you should read in your field
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.700]   and read towards your goals.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.600]   So read anything that you want,
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.660]   but I think there should be a good variety
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.100]   in your reading materials.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.860]   You want to choose books that are gonna move you
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.500]   in the direction that you want to go in life.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.460]   This does not have to all be how to become a better manager,
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.860]   but if you are a manager,
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.240]   it should include some books
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.320]   on how to become a better manager,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.240]   but it should also include books on other areas of goals
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.460]   that you have or directions that you want to take yourself.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.520]   Do not keep all of your reading light and fluffy.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.520]   Instead, focus on learning the real meat of your industry.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.880]   Study the textbooks, study the formal textbooks,
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.080]   the deep level content, the fundamental texts
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.540]   that are available in your field.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.100]   I say this because in our modern day,
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.500]   we have access now to so much great information
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.000]   through podcasts, videos, et cetera,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.380]   but this kind of information in any field
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.780]   is often the most surface level information.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.840]   And there are many of us who consume that information
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.720]   and that's a great start, better than not consuming it.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.040]   But if you don't go deeper,
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.200]   you're never gonna wind up being a thought leader.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.680]   So when you consume information and education
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.320]   and learning in an area, you should go a little deeper
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.580]   and say, how can I get back
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.780]   to the core fundamental sources of this area?
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.720]   So make sure that some of your reading is at a deep level.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.840]   Make sure that you are looking up, again,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.520]   the college textbooks that are in use,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.500]   in the classes that are related to something
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.960]   that you want to improve at.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.120]   Make sure that you're going back to the source materials.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.420]   Make sure you're reading the old books and the new books.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.020]   Incidentally, this is one of the things
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.920]   that is most important about making sure
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.000]   that you have habits of reading with your eyes,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.760]   as well as with your ears.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.780]   For modern popular level texts,
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.560]   you can often find an audio book.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.460]   And so I find this a very convenient format
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.100]   to consume books in while I'm out walking,
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.500]   jogging, hiking, et cetera, doing exercise, doing dishes.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.660]   I like to consume modern popular level texts
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.420]   in the form of an audio book.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.420]   But when you go to your serious reading
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.820]   and you're reading a textbook,
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.380]   a college level textbook in your field,
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.720]   or you're going back to the primary sources
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.140]   and you're studying the doctoral dissertation
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.280]   that somebody wrote,
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.620]   or you're reading a book that was written in 1950
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.700]   that continues to be the basic book
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.340]   that explains everything you need to know about a subject,
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.860]   it's unusual to find those books in an audio book format.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.820]   So you need to make sure
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.180]   that you have time to read with your ears,
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.740]   but also that you have a basic habit
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.180]   of reading with your eyes on a daily basis.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.260]   Now, step number two of Tracy's 1000% formula
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.780]   is to make a list.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.820]   You make a list of everything you have to do that day.
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.820]   It's important to have a physical list
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.780]   of the things that you need to do.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.660]   And then you take that list and you organize it
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.000]   and you prioritize it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.260]   You organize your list by priorities.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.820]   You determine which task is of number one importance,
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.860]   number two importance, et cetera.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.940]   As Tracy says, if you will simply plan
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.460]   and prioritize your activities every day in advance,
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.780]   you'll increase your productivity by 25%
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.280]   on your very first day.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.400]   This is a habit that's easy to know about.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.460]   It's harder to do consistently.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.500]   And yet it remains the fundamental action
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.200]   that you and I can take on a daily basis
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.860]   to improve our effectiveness.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.900]   Prioritize the things that we need to do
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.220]   and always do the most important things first.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.340]   Step four, start on your most important task
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.660]   and work on it single-mindedly
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.060]   with concentration, focus, and discipline
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.700]   until your most important task is done.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.600]   As Tracy says, if you will concentrate
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.460]   on your most important task,
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.860]   you will increase your productivity by 50%.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.240]   So the point of combining these things together
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.740]   is that the reading provides you
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.360]   with creative fodder and information,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.640]   but reading is never enough to advance and to be useful.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.580]   Productivity is the key.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.980]   And so notice that listing out what you need to do,
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.980]   prioritizing it, starting on your most important task
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.660]   and working on it single-mindedly
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.300]   with concentration, focus, and discipline
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:00.060]   and until it's done, that's where you get action, action.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.060]   Step number five, listen to educational audio in your car.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.020]   For most people, historically,
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.880]   I haven't seen this data updated in a very long time,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.100]   but back in the '90s and the 2000s,
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.300]   it was said that the average person spends
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.260]   about the same amount of time in his or her car
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.060]   as the average college student spends in class.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.380]   Let's say that's, and how you get there is,
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.460]   let's say that a full-time college load
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.740]   is considered to be 12 to 18 credit hours per week.
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.740]   So 12 hours per week divided over seven days
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:41.500]   would be 1.7 hours per day of time in the car.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.820]   That's probably not too far off of what many people commute.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.460]   Frequently, people commute 35 minutes back and forth
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.220]   to work and then all the other little time,
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.700]   little trips here and there.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.740]   And so if you turn your drive time into learning time,
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.060]   you can spend about the same amount of time
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.460]   learning as a college student does
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.140]   while you're also doing other things.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.180]   And of course, many of us have other activities as well,
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.100]   doing dishes, cleaning up, doing yard work, et cetera.
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.980]   And so you wanna listen to educational audio.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.860]   Now, my answer here is, or my suggestion,
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.060]   is that you choose your learning materials,
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.540]   again, based upon your goals
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.420]   and what is valuable to you in the moment.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.820]   And so your content should include podcasts.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.260]   Podcasts have a lot of benefits
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.420]   and some significant disadvantages.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.060]   A great benefit of a podcast is the access
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.780]   to current cutting edge ideas and conversations.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:41.780]   The problem of podcasts is they're not all very content rich.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.020]   There's a lot of time that can be lost
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.120]   due to the minimal preparation
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.620]   that is put into the production of many podcasts.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.180]   And so you want your listening time to be efficient.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.700]   And so you want to consume the things
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.380]   that are gonna be the most efficient.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.560]   Podcasts are most useful to you
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.820]   to dip your toe in something new.
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.100]   And that's how I tend to consume podcasts,
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.540]   is simply to take an area of interest of mine
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.540]   and go and look for a podcast on it.
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.360]   Because there's no financial cost,
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.100]   I don't have to make a big commitment to it.
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.140]   I don't have to go and buy a bunch of books.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.260]   I just, eh, here's a podcast on it.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.380]   And then because of the way podcasts are often done,
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.900]   in an hour of podcast listening,
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.800]   you can get an overview of a subject
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.500]   that may be hard to get in an eight hour audio book
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.700]   that is trying to provide information
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.540]   in a more comprehensive manner.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.660]   So choose podcasts to listen to that fit your goals
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.960]   and that are based around things
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.460]   that are valuable to you in the moment.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.380]   There are classic audio programs that are available.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.520]   I've been a big consumer over the years
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.020]   of Nightingale Conant programs.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:55.020]   They were a provider of audio programs, self-help programs.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.780]   They're still really good, a lot of the good old stuff.
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.700]   And this is where Tony Robbins got his start
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.740]   and Brian Tracy programs, et cetera.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.180]   And there's lots of other programs
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.660]   that are available from places like that.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.680]   I think audio books are in many ways a superior option
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.320]   to either of these options.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.260]   Because an audio book gives you superior quality
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.740]   and insights into a subject
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.820]   because of the nature of its creation and editing.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.040]   When an author sits down and writes a book,
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.020]   unless it's just a quick $1.99 Kindle book,
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.380]   he generally will invest thousands of hours,
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.100]   definitely hundreds and generally thousands of hours
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.260]   into the actual creation of that book,
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.180]   a systemized research process, preparing for it,
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:46.180]   a very careful organization principle behind the book.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.500]   He will engage in very careful editing
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.660]   to make sure that all of the fluff is gone
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.780]   and the real meat is there.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.460]   This is why books are such a superior option
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.500]   for your learning,
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.820]   because they are giants standing on the shoulders of giants,
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.500]   standing on the shoulders of giants,
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.300]   giving you their insights and education
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.300]   for a mere $10 or $15 or $20, et cetera.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.500]   And so here, your best options are an Audible subscription,
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.100]   as well as something through your local library,
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.180]   such as Hoopla, where you gain access to free books.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.540]   So if you have a local library card,
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.260]   a lot of times most local libraries
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.540]   now have some kind of audio book service,
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.060]   Hoopla, there are others as well,
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.300]   but Hoopla seems to be the leading one at the moment,
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.660]   where now you can listen to audio books for free
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.380]   based on your library subscription.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.040]   It's a really great option.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.100]   Next, I really love YouTube University.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.180]   And by that, I just mean going to YouTube
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.380]   and looking for videos on things.
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.740]   I think that a YouTube premium subscription
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.020]   that allows you to skip all advertisements
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.020]   and to download videos so that they're always available
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.420]   is some of the best money that you can make.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.260]   YouTube is fantastic because of its cutting edge nature.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.300]   You can often get some of the most current insights
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.140]   into a field, get involved with some of the current debates,
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.300]   current best practices, et cetera.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.180]   The downside of YouTube is it can be time consuming
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.340]   and hard to filter for quality.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.700]   There's not a really great quality filter.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.020]   And this is again why I think that something
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.820]   that has been vetted by trusted editors
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.500]   is of higher priority,
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.100]   but because that vetting process is so time consuming,
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.740]   you often don't get cutting edge information.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.820]   So they should go together.
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.900]   And then in addition to YouTube University,
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.860]   of course, iTunes University quite literally leads
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.500]   into free online college courses.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.340]   So iTunes University or Coursera,
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.180]   all of the online courses available from MIT,
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.100]   Harvard, Stanford, et cetera, it's all available.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.460]   You simply go to the website
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.540]   and you can consume the college courses.
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.100]   And I think this is really important to do
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.180]   for areas that you have interest in
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.340]   because you wanna make sure
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.580]   that your learning is not ignorant,
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.020]   that you are not ignorant of what is considered
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:18.020]   to be the general standard of knowledge in a subject.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.700]   You wanna make sure that you're not ignorant
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.060]   of the corpus of information that a skilled
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.340]   and trained person in that area would have.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.060]   And so going and consuming college lectures
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.380]   and consuming all of the college lectures for courses
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.780]   will help you to make sure that your learning
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.940]   is not unduly influenced by the one book you found
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.780]   that you really liked
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.580]   or the author that you latched onto,
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.740]   but rather that you understand what is taught
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.180]   at the college level.
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.780]   And college teachers are,
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.700]   by virtue of their screening process,
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.700]   they are experts in their domain.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.540]   And they have a duty to their students
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.060]   to represent all of the different aspects
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.060]   of their particular course content.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.700]   And so it's a really great way of making sure
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.180]   that your knowledge is compendious
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.340]   and that you yourself have a broad education
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.340]   that complements your deep education
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.980]   in the self-chosen materials.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.860]   So those are all things that are available to you
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.820]   to listen to in your car.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.380]   I would encourage you also to make certain
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.940]   that not all of your learning is autodidactic.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.780]   Consider engaging in formalized courses
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.540]   and credentialization in your field.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.900]   While self-directed learning
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.060]   is the most powerful form of learning
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.180]   because of your engagement with it,
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.260]   self-directed learning is not always recognized
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.540]   immediately in the business world.
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.100]   And so formalized learning that comes with credentials
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.100]   is a really important component of your overall package.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:58.580]   It may be hip to despise a college degree
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.460]   or despise an MBA,
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.420]   but those formalized credentials
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.180]   and the achievement of those formalized credentials
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.380]   is still one of the most reliable way
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.020]   for individuals to raise salaries.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.900]   Pay attention and go ahead
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.620]   and get your formalized credentials as well.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.260]   Now, Tracy's number six in his thousand percent formula
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.820]   is to ask yourself two questions after every activity.
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.580]   And these are two questions that I consider
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:30.580]   to be incredibly useful for self-coaching.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.900]   Question number one is, what did I do right?
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.900]   You can do this every day.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.940]   What did I do right today?
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.100]   You can do this after every meeting.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.220]   What did I do right in that meeting?
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.420]   You can do this after every date.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.620]   What did I do right on that date?
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.540]   Do this after every trip.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.500]   What did I do right on that trip?
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.460]   What did I do right?
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.620]   It's important to take a moment
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.660]   and acknowledge the things that you do well,
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.740]   the things that went well and celebrate your successes.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.540]   Question number two that you ask yourself
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.980]   after every activity is,
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.940]   what would I do differently next time?
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.460]   What would I do differently next time?
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.180]   Notice the wonderful tone, not judgmental, but informed.
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.340]   What would I do differently next time if I had the chance?
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.660]   And if you just ask yourself those two questions
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.660]   after every activity that you're involved in,
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.500]   what did I do right?
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.260]   And what would I do differently next time?
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.220]   You can coach yourself
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.300]   in the direction of your goals and dreams.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.460]   Now, Tracy's point seven of his thousand percent formula
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.700]   is treat everyone you meet and interact with
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.940]   like a million dollar customer.
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.340]   Treat everybody with respect, with kindness, with esteem.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.020]   Treat everyone you meet and interact with
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.500]   like a million dollar customer.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.860]   And if you do that, you go around through the world
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.020]   surrounded by a pleasant haze of happiness
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.620]   and respect and appreciation, 'cause it comes from you.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:54.340]   Now, over the years, I've taken those seven points,
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.380]   which are Tracy's original seven points,
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.620]   and I've just added just a few things to them.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.780]   So again, Tracy's are read two hours a day,
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.260]   sorry, one hour a day, or first thing in the morning,
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.780]   list what you need to do that day, prioritize your list,
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.260]   start on your most important task,
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.700]   work on it single-mindedly,
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.180]   listen to educational audio programs in your car,
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.380]   ask yourself two questions after every activity,
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.260]   and then treat everyone you meet and interact with
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.260]   like a million dollar customer.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.660]   That was Tracy's.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.220]   As I've modified it over the year,
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.420]   I have a tendency to divide it into education and action.
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:28.060]   And so for education, I've always added a couple of things.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.180]   Number one, you have reading and listening,
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.980]   but I've always recommended to people
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.380]   that they also attend conferences.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.300]   I think that having a goal of attending four conferences
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:43.300]   per year in your field is a really useful goal.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.980]   And I've benefited from this so much.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.500]   I have not done this myself over the last few years
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.420]   because of having a bunch of babies in the house,
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.940]   hard for my wife for me to be away,
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.740]   and so I actively avoid being away very much.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.860]   Of course, today we can do online conferences,
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.180]   which are a great option.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.860]   But the point of a conference is that you can have
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:08.820]   in one single conference, a very concentrated exposure
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.220]   to all of the activity in your field.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.460]   You can not only meet the movers and shakers,
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.020]   not only harvest the current cutting edge ideas,
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.540]   but get a broad overview of the topics that are of interest.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.300]   I love to take a brochure from a conference
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.700]   and read through the titles for the talks
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.900]   and the presentations.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.500]   And that'll give me an idea of what are the current areas
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.420]   of focus for this particular industry
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.300]   or this particular movement.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.260]   You also, of course, have access to an expo hall.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.820]   You can go and you can find out who all the companies are
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.820]   and the vendors that are involved in your industry.
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.180]   And these things are the threads that you can pull on
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.660]   to start to push yourself
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.860]   in the direction of new opportunities.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.860]   Conferences are wonderful ways
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.740]   for you to make connections with people,
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.720]   to start to build friendships.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.180]   They are the best way for you to dig your well
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.780]   of friendships before you're thirsty.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.220]   You always wanna dig your well before you're thirsty
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.060]   and you wanna dig your well of contacts and connections
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.540]   and friendships in your industry
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.060]   or in an industry that you aspire to join
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.620]   long before you need them.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.500]   It's difficult to go to a conference
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.260]   with a folder full of resumes
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.720]   and go booth to booth and pass them out.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.980]   That's difficult.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.240]   Not impossible, not a bad idea, but difficult.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.380]   It's much more effective for you to go
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.140]   to an annual industry conference
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.260]   for two or three years in a row,
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.580]   making connections, making friends intentionally
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.380]   while at that conference.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.020]   And then three years from now,
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.860]   let it be known that you're looking for more opportunities.
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.020]   But in order to have the best opportunities,
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.140]   you have to have been digging that well of connection
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.060]   and contact, et cetera.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.140]   I have a whole class that I teach some people
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.860]   on how to maximize conferences.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.740]   They're very under used by many people in today's world.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.100]   And yet as we increasingly are isolated physically,
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.980]   their importance of industry conferences is only rising.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:14.240]   And so making good use of them is really important.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.220]   I want to give you just a hint though.
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.880]   One of the best things that you can do at a conference
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.240]   is use it as a way to gain access to all of the people
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.720]   who were involved in that industry.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.640]   And so your best friend in making good use of conferences
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:35.400]   is for you to take the brochure
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.520]   and systematically write down the speakers of the conference,
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.240]   their names, connect with them in some format,
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.680]   write down the companies that those speakers work for,
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.000]   get familiar with their work,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.900]   and then go through the vendor list
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.540]   and be connected with all the people
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.200]   who are supplying that industry.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.560]   And if you do that and you start systematically
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.360]   making connections at a conference,
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.600]   all you need is one conference
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.440]   to give you your connection roadmap,
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.040]   which can be in a tremendous roadmap for your opportunities.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.240]   Now, another thing that I urge people to do
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.560]   is to learn how to be an effective public speaker.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.240]   I really love still to recommend Toastmasters International
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.520]   as the single best, most available organization
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.240]   for you to practice and polish
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.600]   both your public speaking skills and your leadership skills
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.000]   in a structured, safe, risk-free environment.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.120]   And if you do that,
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.000]   then conferences will ultimately become
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.320]   one of the most important ways
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.840]   for you to gain exposure for yourself and your ideas.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.720]   After all, think of what we've said.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.640]   You've read, if you've read 500 books in your field
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.920]   over the next decade,
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.120]   and you develop polished public speaking skills,
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.880]   how is it possible that anyone at that conference
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.240]   is going to know more than you?
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.320]   And why wouldn't you be one of the most sought-after speakers
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.240]   in that field?
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.880]   If you're doing the hard work of genuinely preparing yourself
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.840]   and you're implementing on a daily basis
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.760]   these ideas into your actual work,
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   thus building a resume of success on a daily basis,
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.520]   why wouldn't you yourself be one of the sought-after speakers
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.880]   on the industry conference circuit?
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.640]   That's the 25-minute version of the 1000% formula.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.440]   Brian Tracy taught that to me in high school.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.200]   I have implemented it pretty decently over the years,
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.040]   and the formula has worked pretty decently.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.880]   And I think that this can be repeated multiple times
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.680]   during somebody's career.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.920]   I think that it's very reasonable
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.320]   for somebody to start off as a young adult,
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.280]   early 20s, mid 20s,
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.880]   make a 10x increase in income
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.160]   over the first decade of his or her career.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.680]   I think it's very reasonable to make another 10x jump
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.000]   over the second decade.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.680]   At that point in time,
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.920]   your selection of an industry
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.280]   seems to make a much bigger difference
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.440]   than some other factors,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.360]   and your willingness to do the hard work.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.320]   So let's put some numbers on this to get an idea.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.880]   Let's say you come out of,
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.760]   let's say that you're 25 years old
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.040]   and you're making $60,000.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.400]   Well, going from 60 to $600,000 is very doable
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.040]   in a decade in many industries.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.760]   Again, there's a lot of strategic shuffling
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.800]   that has to happen.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.360]   You need to be good at promoting yourself
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.200]   and your ideas.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.480]   You need to be good at moving for opportunities.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.960]   You need to be good at choosing companies
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.800]   that are on the upswing,
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.760]   choosing industries that are on the upswing, et cetera.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.960]   It's not automatic,
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.440]   but I think that's a very reliable path.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.080]   I've seen it done again and again.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.960]   Making another jump from $600,000 a year
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.480]   to $6 million a year is very doable, very doable.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.480]   But in order for it to be done,
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.080]   you need to be in an industry
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:01.120]   where you are directly rewarded for your great effectiveness.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.680]   And so you're either gonna be
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.120]   in upper levels of management at a company
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.320]   where you have good bonus compensation, et cetera,
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.600]   or you are gonna be in a place
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.960]   where you have a direct connection
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.080]   between your impact and your effectiveness.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.400]   And that's only possible
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.240]   in certain highly compensated areas.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.200]   So if you are involved in sales,
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.560]   you're involved in marketing,
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.320]   and you have a piece of the action, so to speak,
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.040]   then you can definitely justify
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.600]   excellent multi-seven figure salaries.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.560]   To go by another 1,000% jump
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.560]   from $6 million to $60 million is certainly possible,
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:46.120]   but it becomes very difficult to predict the exact pathway.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:52.240]   So eventually this formula does, I think, break down
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.720]   in terms of its predictability.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.560]   I can't promise this four times over,
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.960]   but there are definitely many people
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.840]   who over the course of three decades
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.840]   have been able to repeat the formula three times over.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.640]   There are a shockingly high number
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.600]   of businessmen earning $60 million a year
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.520]   after a three-decade career, a shockingly high number.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.560]   There's a shockingly high number of people
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.640]   making $600 million a year
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.240]   on the end of a four-decade career.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.560]   But again, this has to do with your willingness
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.400]   to do the work, your willingness to take the risk, et cetera.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.840]   So I don't present this to you
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   as a perfect description of what you can expect,
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.760]   but I think it's a useful and compelling mental model,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.320]   which when combined with other ways
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.720]   of making sure that you're moving
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.280]   in the direction of highly valuable skills,
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.320]   you're working at the highest levels of value, et cetera,
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.160]   I think it's a very useful model.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.320]   And at the end of the day,
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.880]   it helps you and me to focus on what we can control.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.160]   We can control what time we go to bed today
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.280]   so that we can get up tomorrow
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.440]   and read for 30 to 60 minutes in our field.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.960]   We can control the list that we make today
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.440]   of everything that we need to do tomorrow.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.400]   We can take a moment and we can prioritize that list
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.360]   based upon those things that are of the highest priority
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.760]   and those that are lowest priority.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.960]   Tomorrow, we can start on our most important task
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.680]   and we can work on it single-mindedly
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.520]   with concentration, focus, and discipline until it's done.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.600]   Today and tomorrow, when we have time,
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.680]   we can line up some useful and helpful educational audio
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.720]   to put in our ears and in our car
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.520]   when we're driving, walking, et cetera.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.000]   Today and tomorrow, you can ask yourself those two questions
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.920]   after every activity.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.200]   And today and tomorrow,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.320]   you can start treating everyone you meet
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.480]   and interact with like a million dollar customer.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.680]   Hope these ideas in one specific place are useful to you
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.560]   and I hope that you experience great success
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.040]   from the application of them.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.520]   As I close down today's podcast,
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.520]   I want to remind you of the event that I am hosting
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:16.320]   in January of 2024 in Panama City, Panama.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.880]   And I would love to extend to you a personal invitation
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.760]   for you to come to that event.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.720]   I've teamed up with my friends, Gabriel Custodiate
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.200]   and Mikkel Thorup to do a one-week,
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.800]   we're calling it an investment tour,
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.680]   an expat exploration and investment tour of Panama.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.240]   And this will be a one-week tour.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.600]   We're gonna have events in Panama City.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.480]   We've got conference presentations
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.760]   on various aspects of investing, internationalization,
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.440]   banking, taxation, cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, et cetera,
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.560]   wealth protection, family foundations, offshore planning.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.800]   We have several tours planned
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.240]   of a couple of different communities
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.760]   as well as like a gold storage vault
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.040]   that we're gonna be visiting, et cetera.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.480]   It's gonna be an amazing time.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.200]   And not only will it be full of information,
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.760]   inspiration, education, but it's gonna be full of fun.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.760]   I'll be there hanging out with you the whole time
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.880]   as well as 39 of your fellow listeners.
