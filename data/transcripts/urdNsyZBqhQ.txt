[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   The following is a conversation with Rabbi David Wolpe, someone who I have been a fan
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.240]   of for many years, for the kindness in his heart, the strength of his character, and
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.280]   the kind of friends he keeps and talks with, many of whom disagree with him but love him
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.440]   nevertheless, including the late Christopher Hitchens.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.640]   I will have many conversations like these in the future about religion, about Islam,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.320]   Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others, looking to understand and celebrate
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.600]   the culture, the tradition, and the beauty of the people who practice these religions.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.840]   I will of course not shy away from the difficult topics.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.420]   I will talk both about hate and love, about war and peace.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.080]   This conversation was recorded more than three weeks ago.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.640]   Please allow me this time to speak on what has been on my mind.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.200]   If this is not interesting to you, please skip.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.000]   I totally understand.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.280]   Some people asked me to say a few words on the war in Ukraine.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.800]   I think my words are worth little, but perhaps let me try.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.320]   I considered doing a long solo episode on this war.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.120]   I tried several times, but it is too personal for now.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.680]   To give you context, I have been talking to refugees, friends, loved ones, in Ukraine,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.520]   in Russia, in Poland, Slovakia, Moldova, Romania, even UK, Germany, Canada, India, China, and
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.720]   of course the United States.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.560]   Some of them crying, or angry, or confused, or scared.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.040]   I am helping as best as I can privately, and I am hoping to help in the future by traveling
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.640]   to Ukraine and Russia and celebrating the humanity and the beauty of the people in this
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.040]   region.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.600]   This was all set up both for Ukraine and Russia trips before 2022, including conversations
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.840]   with scientists, artists, athletes, leaders, and just "regular folks" who are equally
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.520]   if not more fascinating to me.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.320]   For now, it has become much more difficult, but I will keep trying to find a way.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.640]   I was born in the Soviet Union.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.000]   My roots are both Ukrainian and Russian.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.880]   And today, and until the day I die, I am an American.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.240]   I am proud of all of this.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.080]   I hope to keep celebrating the culture and the incredible human beings that make up these
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.240]   nations and humanity as a whole.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.240]   We are all one people.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.240]   We are in this together.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.440]   That is how I feel about the people of these nations.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.600]   Now let me speak about those in the seats of power.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.840]   I condemn all actions of leaders who play geopolitical games on the world stage disregarding
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.200]   the costs paid in human suffering on the scale of millions.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.160]   For this reason, I condemn Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.640]   And I condemn many of the military interventions by the superpowers of the world, including
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.000]   by my country, the country I love, the United States, that after World War II has intervened
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.760]   in over 40 nations, with many studies finding that the United States is culpable for an
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.440]   unfathomable number of civilian deaths.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.280]   I condemn all heads of state who needlessly wage wars, watching young men and women burn
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.640]   in the fires they started.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.360]   I don't understand how humans can be so cruel to each other, or rather I understand, but
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.640]   I believe in a future world where this is no longer true.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.080]   Let me also say a few words of what I hope to do with this podcast.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.000]   I want to explore the full complexity and beauty of human nature.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.760]   I believe each of us are capable of good and evil, and I want to understand how the mind
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.600]   and the circumstance lead one to choose the former path or the latter.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.400]   And I believe conversation is one of the best ways to work toward this understanding.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.200]   For that, I think I have to not only talk to the most inspiring humans in the world,
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.840]   but also to the most controversial.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.160]   I will speak with many people who I disagree with.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   Politicians, activists, CEOs, heads of state, with very different opinions on the world.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.040]   I will try hard to challenge their ideas without closing my mind to the depth and complexity
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.980]   of their perspective and their humanity.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.640]   My presence in the same room with wildly different people will make it easy for the media and
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.920]   the internet to pick and choose clips and snapshots attacking me for being a shill for
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.080]   one side or the other.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.840]   I can't defend this point, except to say that I'm a shill for no one, and that I hope you
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.880]   see the strength of my integrity, that I won't be influenced by any of them, no matter how
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.560]   rich, powerful, or charismatic they are.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.640]   Like the poem "If" by Roger Kipling says, "If you can talk with crowds and keep your
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.680]   virtue, or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   can hurt you, if all men count with you, but none too much."
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.000]   This is a really, really important thing to me that I try to live by, that all human beings
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.940]   count with me the same.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.920]   People have criticized me for wanting to have some of these conversations, like with Vladimir
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.340]   Putin and Vladimir Zelensky, and for times in the past speaking about them without the
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.600]   seriousness the topic deserves.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.680]   For this, I would sincerely like to apologize.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.200]   I'm disappointed, even ashamed, of my frequent ineloquence on these topics.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.080]   I will work hard to do better.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.860]   When I'm joking, it should be clear that it's a joke, and hopefully actually funny.
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.280]   When I'm being serious, I should speak with care and rigor.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.760]   I've now done many hundreds of hours of podcast conversation.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.480]   Despite my frequent failures in speaking, I hope you know where my heart is.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.200]   Unfortunately, I think people will take clips of me and use them to attack me.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.920]   This will happen more and more.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.040]   I guess there's nothing I can do but send them my love.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.960]   In the meantime, try to be a better person and a better interviewer.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.760]   Let me also say that I like humor, especially dark humor.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.080]   I like being silly and not taking myself seriously.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.180]   I will keep taking risks with that, all with the goal of having fun and celebrating humanity
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.960]   at its most absurd and most beautiful.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.680]   I will occasionally dress up in strange and weird outfits to celebrate the absurdity of
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.680]   life.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.440]   I will hang out, break bread, and joke with all kinds of people.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.920]   I don't have to agree with them to laugh with them, in order to escape for a brief moment
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.480]   the tension, the conflict, the hatred in the world.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.840]   Humor just might save this little chaotic little civilization of ours.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.000]   I love the Ukrainian people.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.080]   I love the Russian people.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.320]   And of course, I love my fellow Americans, Californians and Midwesterners, New Yorkers
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.600]   and Texans.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.880]   I love humans.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   I love life.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.600]   And I want to share that love with others, with you.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.040]   If I messed it up, I'm really, really sorry.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.040]   I'm trying my best.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.160]   I have no agenda and no one telling me what to do.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.200]   I feel like the luckiest guy in the world to have all these opportunities.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.560]   And I'm deeply grateful to be alive and to share that joy with other amazing people around
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   me.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.040]   Thank you for your support.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.240]   For all the love you've sent my way, I will work my ass off to not disappoint you.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.520]   I love you all.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.240]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.080]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.080]   And now, here's my conversation with David Welby.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.760]   Let's start with a big question.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.840]   According to Judaism, who is God?
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:17.900]   It's difficult because Judaism, like any tradition that is thousands of years old and encompasses
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:23.480]   so many different lands and languages and thinkers, it doesn't give a single answer
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.520]   to even simple questions and to large questions, it certainly doesn't give a single answer.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.400]   Although Judaism was responsible for introducing the monotheistic idea to the world, it doesn't
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.600]   mean that it's one idea.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:43.040]   So if you take Maimonides, the greatest sage in the Jewish tradition, medieval philosopher,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:49.280]   he would say that God is an omnipotent, benevolent, intangible, unimaginable God.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.880]   In fact, he said, "You can't say what God is, only what God is not," because you have
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   to emphasize...
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.320]   I could talk more about that, but basically you have to emphasize the unknowability of
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.820]   God.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.040]   You have a modern philosopher like Heschel, who says that God is a God of pathos, a God
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:12.880]   of deep feeling, which probably would make Maimonides shiver if he heard such a description.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.080]   And if you look in the Bible, God is always regretting or having human emotions.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.720]   So there are so many different kinds of depictions and ideas, and there is this tremendous tension
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.960]   between transcendence and imminence.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.920]   That is, in the Jewish tradition, God is exquisitely close, God is imminent.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.600]   In the Talmud's words, God is as close as your mouth is to your ear.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.880]   In other words, whatever you say, God hears it.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.500]   And yet at the same time, God is unfathomably distant.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.420]   Sometimes when I speak to high schoolers, I will say, in the Jewish tradition, think
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:56.500]   of it this way, when you were two years old, you had no idea what it was to be a 15-year-old.
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:02.280]   Not only did you not know, but you didn't know what you didn't know.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.120]   We conceive of God as being more, the distance between God and human beings is far greater
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.080]   than the distance between a two-year-old and a 15-year-old.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.300]   So when we speak about God, we have to acknowledge how limited we really are.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.240]   So okay, you laid out a lot of fascinating things on the table.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.560]   So one, the knowability of God.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:28.760]   Then this idea of deep feeling, which again, can God be operating in the space of feelings
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.760]   too?
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.120]   It's the mouth and the ear of the senses.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.480]   Can God be known?
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:44.240]   Can God be felt by this three-year-old in the analogy versus the teenager?
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.200]   So I will take refuge in a beautiful phrase from Martin Buber, another Jewish theologian.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.800]   He said, "God cannot be expressed.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.040]   God can only be addressed."
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.300]   In other words, you can speak to God.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.360]   You can feel a sense of God, but can you begin to comprehend or know God?
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   No.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.560]   Yosef Caspi, I'm pulling in a couple of early Jewish philosophers.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.080]   He said, "To know God, I would have to be God."
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.120]   But can we get close?
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:20.640]   Is it useful or is it a distraction to visualize things, to embody, to create, to attach to
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.800]   the stories some kind of visualizations in our mind?
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:31.520]   For example, gender, he versus she, things like this, or old man in the sky kind of feeling.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.320]   So it's almost inevitable, but I think ultimately you try to transcend it.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.640]   This was the great...
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.160]   We just read this actually in synagogue, the story of the golden calf.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:51.800]   And the story is that human beings found it impossible to not have a visualization because
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:58.080]   they had just come from Egypt and in the world of pagan worship, everything is...
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.700]   It's not that pagans thought that idol was actually God, but it represented visually
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.560]   what God was.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:11.120]   And along comes this idea that God is actually not capable of being visualized, which is
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:17.320]   very difficult and it stretches the bounds of human comprehension, maybe even breaks
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.320]   them.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:26.120]   So would you say the proper way to operate as a human in relation to God is humility
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:32.360]   in that you're screwed, you're not able to basically know anything, almost anything?
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:39.280]   Well the reason that you're the salvation of this is that you can't...
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.280]   I was going to say the reason you're not screwed, but then I thought somebody might be upset
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.120]   at a rabbi saying that.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.680]   So I didn't say it and have not said it.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:55.440]   But the reason you're not is that you don't have to have a comprehension of God, you have
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.240]   to have a relationship to God, and those are not the same.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:06.600]   I mean, to draw an analogy that is not far from perfect as most analogies are, but this
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.480]   one especially, you have relationships with people who are mysteries to you.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.500]   You're a mystery to yourself.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.620]   You can live and love somebody for 50 years and they can say something that surprises
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.720]   you, because ultimately we are trapped in here.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.680]   And when a child first says, "I," we call that individuation.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:33.120]   But what that really means is, "I now know that I am cut off from the minds of all other
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.000]   children and all other people."
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.480]   And so you have with God a more intimate relationship because you can believe that God is...
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.100]   You are known by God and you have a relationship to God despite the fact that you can't know
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.740]   God just as you can't know others.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.940]   And some would say to have a good relationship, you want to be constantly surprised.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.940]   Right.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.940]   You don't want to know the thing...
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.460]   Well, the world, yes, the world that God created is constantly surprising.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.980]   And by the way, the caveat to this, I had all these debates with Christopher Hitchens
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.340]   and he would always say that God is a greater tyrant than North Korea because it continues
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.020]   after your death.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.580]   And the idea of being known by God is after all frightening if you think God knows what
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.380]   I think and so on, if your image of God is unloving.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.900]   Can we jump to this?
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.820]   You had friendships and conversations with a lot of the fascinating figures of the past
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:36.140]   20, 30 years of the great intellectuals, one of which perhaps one of the greats is Christopher
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.220]   Hitchens.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.300]   What have you learned from your conversation, your friendship?
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.180]   So there are a lot of views he held that I really did not agree with, but he was a remarkable
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.180]   person.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.300]   That was a good line about North Korea.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.300]   He was full of incredibly good lines.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.420]   Well, one of the things I learned was you can't win a debate with Christopher Hitchens.
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:59.780]   One of the reasons you can't win is because he has this British baritone and this ready
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:06.480]   wit that you can't triumph over laughter.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.940]   It doesn't matter if your argument is better.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.120]   If your quip is better, you win.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.660]   And so I remember once we were arguing about free will and he said, "Well, I choose to
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.660]   believe in it."
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.060]   And everybody laughed and that was despite the fact that that's not really an argument.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.780]   Or like, "I have free will because I don't have a choice."
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.780]   Right, exactly.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.540]   And people should watch your conversation with him.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.540]   It's great.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:35.140]   I mean, it's a kind of David versus Goliath situation and you're quite masterful at using
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.620]   charisma and sweet-talking Christopher Hitchens.
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.620]   I also genuinely liked him.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:47.620]   I mean, I spent a three-hour limousine ride with him from one debate to another, from
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:53.580]   LA to San Diego, and the entire time he said, "We just can't talk about religion."
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:59.100]   So we talked about literature and he gave me a long lecture about Scotch.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.980]   He was inexhaustible.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.060]   I mean, not only did he...
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:10.140]   I wrote a couple of obituaries about him and one I began with the historian Keith Thomas
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:15.140]   said there are two ways of achieving immortality, by doing things worth remembering or saying
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.260]   things worth remembering.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.860]   And by that standard, he did both.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.500]   I mean, he went all around the world to all sorts of danger zones.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:28.260]   He knew the best bars everywhere from Kuala Lumpur to Beirut to LA.
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:35.380]   And he could drink all night and write a 2000 word essay on the poetry of Yeats and go to
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.380]   sleep.
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.260]   I remember before one of our debates in Boston, he was at the bar and he said, "Come have
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.260]   a drink."
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.860]   And I said, "I'm not going to have a drink before I go to debate with you.
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.860]   What are you crazy?"
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.480]   And he said, "Just have a beer, it's water."
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:58.980]   So he really was a constant inexhaustible fountain of intrigue and interest.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:04.140]   What kind of things, if you can remember, if you can mention, if you can admit to have
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:09.980]   him enlightening you or helping you change your mind about something in this world?
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.860]   So I think...
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.860]   Unrelated to Scotch.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.220]   Yeah, unrelated to Scotch.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:21.440]   He convinced me that the idea...
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.800]   I mean, I had my doubts about it and have my doubts about it, but he convinced me through
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:31.600]   many debates, and not only he, that the idea that religion makes people better is not...
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:38.160]   It's not ipso facto wrong, but it's a much, much more complicated argument than I wished
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.760]   it to be.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:45.900]   So he is, however you conceive of the term, beauty.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:53.340]   He's one of the more beautiful humans this weird little earth produced.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:18:00.460]   So how do you explain the atheism combined with such a beautiful mind?
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:07.900]   So from your perspective of a man of faith, how do you think about that?
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:17.220]   So of the atheists that I have debated, I think about all of them somewhat differently.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:23.100]   So I think that in some deep way, for example, Sam Harris is a religious personality.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.260]   I don't even think that he would...
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.720]   He wouldn't like the word religious, but I don't even think that he would take issue
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.100]   with that.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:35.660]   I think that he would say his is a purely material-based spirituality, but I mean, his
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:41.300]   orientation towards meditation and appreciation of Buddhism, there's something deeply seeking
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.340]   spiritual about him.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.500]   With Hitchens, I honestly...
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.540]   And I know that some of his fans will really not like this.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:57.300]   It's not that he was any kind of closet believer, certainly not at all, but I almost feel as
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:04.940]   though he was less a passionate arguer against religion than he was, first of all, extremely
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.620]   upset by the forms that religion took in this world.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:15.140]   And then once he trained his intellectual howitzers on a target, he had so much fun
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:23.540]   inventing new arguments and attacking it that I really believe he gets carried away sometimes
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:28.940]   by his own eloquence and intellectual range.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:34.140]   So for example, the idea that you would call a book that religion poisons everything, I
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.620]   think he did that deliberately, provocatively, so that he could defend a proposition that
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.580]   obviously is indefensible, that it poisons everything.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.700]   So I don't know.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.900]   I think he had tremendous joie de vivre.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.900]   That's what sums him up.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:56.460]   This guy loved life in all of its manifestations, and arguing against something that someone
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.940]   else believed was one of his greatest joys.
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.940]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.700]   And of course, the practical aspect of that, he just saw the powerful and he challenged
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.740]   them with humor and so on.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:12.180]   And you could argue perhaps that humor is the highest form of what humanity can achieve.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.780]   Sometimes maybe us little humans take things a little too seriously, then sometimes we
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:21.900]   need to just laugh at it all, laugh at ourselves, and that's probably the purest form of wisdom.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.620]   You know, Auden, the poet, said, "Among the people that I like or admire, I can find no
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.620]   common quality, but among those I love, I can.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.540]   All of them make me laugh."
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.540]   There you have it.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:38.260]   Now, speaking of people that make you laugh, Sam Harris, because he actually has a really
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.260]   great sense of humor.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.260]   He does.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.220]   With a very cold and monotone delivery.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:51.100]   He's another one that you had friends with, you have good conversations with.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.300]   What's your fundamental disagreements and agreements with Sam?
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.500]   Sam believes that religion is intellectually indefensible.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.260]   He really believes it deep in his soul.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:11.940]   And he gets angry at the idea that a proposition should be unchallenged if it offends his sense
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.940]   of logic.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:13.940]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.380]   So he cannot move on until this is dealt with.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.380]   Nope.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:23.540]   In fact, I mean, I did a podcast with Eric Weinstein and then Sam did one.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.580]   And Sam said, "When I heard your podcast with David Wolpe, I learned stuff about what he
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.540]   thinks that I never learned in my conversations with him because I can never let him make
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.540]   those unfounded assertions without challenging them and you just let them go."
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.860]   And I think that there was something to that.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:48.340]   It was like he finds it hard to have a conversation about religion that doesn't arouse his real
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.580]   ire about the harm that he thinks religion does in the world.
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:58.540]   So it's more about the implementation of religion in the world as it is versus the really fundamental...
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:03.900]   I think he also thinks it's fundamentally intellectually shoddy and disreputable.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.900]   Faith.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.380]   Yeah, faith.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.380]   I don't know how to put this.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:13.320]   I mean, they're both capable of separating their contempt for religion from the people
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.220]   that they have sitting in front of them.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.020]   You mean Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris?
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.020]   Yes, both of them.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.260]   Okay, so you mentioned Eric Weinstein.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.260]   People should listen to your conversation with Eric.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.260]   It's a fascinating one.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.260]   It's great.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.260]   It's nonstandard.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.020]   It just goes all over the place in this humor and wit.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.020]   It's great.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.540]   So one interesting aspect that I also learned, perhaps not about you, but about Eric, well,
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:44.340]   about both, but Eric has a similar thing as with Jordan Peterson, which is if you ask
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.060]   them, "Do they believe in God?" I think the answer, they're not comfortable answering
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.780]   that question, or they might say no, but they're usually just not comfortable answering that
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:54.780]   question.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:23:01.180]   But there's a kind of sense that they would like to live life, a religious life, as if
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.460]   God exists.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.960]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.260]   I think, first of all, Eric has a really deep appreciation of the Jewish tradition.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.780]   I don't know Peterson.
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.740]   I've read his stuff and I've reviewed his stuff and so on.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:22.180]   But I think that Jungians are, in their very approach, they believe that myth is the way
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.500]   the world works.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:29.440]   So it's not that big a leap to God, but there's still a distance there.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.820]   Is it possible to have your cake and eat it too?
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:39.540]   Is it possible to have the depth of a religious life without believing in God?
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:45.220]   How do you make sense of Eric Weinstein's devout life within the tradition?
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.620]   I mean, I honestly think he believes in God, but doesn't believe in God.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:54.220]   And it's oscillating like it's a quantum mechanical system of some sort.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.300]   Schrodinger's God.
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:02.380]   So I think that he would probably agree with what Elie Wiesel said, that a Jew can be angry
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:07.580]   at God or be disbelieving of God, but is not allowed to be indifferent to God.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.900]   And I think Eric's not indifferent to God.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.780]   And it's different than Christianity.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:23.020]   I've had this conversation many times because you can be very Jewish and have deep doubts
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.860]   about theological questions because Judaism isn't a religion.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.660]   It's a religious family.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.580]   And so you're born Jewish.
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:36.580]   Like if I said to you tomorrow, if I was Christian and I said, "Oh, I believe in Jesus today,"
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.780]   and then tomorrow I didn't, I'm not Christian anymore.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.700]   But if tomorrow I said, "Oh, I don't believe all this stuff," I'm still Jewish.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.780]   So it's a more complicated system.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:54.420]   Having said that though, I think it's very hard to sustain over generations without some
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.180]   belief that the source of it is beyond ourselves.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.380]   And in that sense, as in many others, Eric is unique.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:10.140]   - Well, he was actually making that claim that we need faith to propagate this tradition
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.300]   through the generations.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.900]   So without that, the traditions crumble.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:23.580]   It's a very interesting idea and very interesting argument for devout faith, which is it's a
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.620]   glue that holds a tradition together.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.940]   Otherwise, traditions fall apart.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.620]   You can't have the intensity of that tradition.
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.500]   I mean, on the other hand, you do see traditions.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.660]   I mean, Thanksgiving, one of my favorite.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.940]   - So I would say traditions that are demanding fall apart.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.660]   Traditions that require turkey might not fall apart, but traditions that make demands of
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:50.540]   you that are counter-cultural or are hard, they fall apart.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:55.660]   - I think I need to introduce you to some Thanksgiving dinners that are quite demanding.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.340]   Getting the family together.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:02.020]   There's a, first of all, I'm a vegetarian, so I'm tough to have a Thanksgiving dinner,
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.180]   but there's a comedian named Kathy Lansman who, one year, I heard this on the radio and
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.500]   it stuck with me.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.540]   She said that holidays are a chance to renew your resentments afresh.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.620]   And that's basically what people do with their families.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:20.060]   It's like, I'm gonna go home and fight with the uncle again this year.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:25.380]   - I apologize to take a dark turn, but you mentioned Elie Wiesel.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:32.260]   I recently saw a picture of Elie Wiesel when he was in the camp, when he was liberated.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.260]   For some reason, that hit hard.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:43.380]   Like, you know, I've seen pictures in concentration camps of people I don't know, or whose words
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.140]   I haven't really felt and gone through.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:54.260]   But for some reason, like, here's just a normal person, like a normal body laying there.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.260]   That was him.
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.180]   I've seen it.
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:03.100]   And you see, you can see his face, but at the same time, you see that this is an amazing...
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:08.140]   And I think what's so disturbing about it is exactly what you were saying, is I've seen
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.900]   a thousand people like this, and I know this one, and I know what he became.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:18.580]   So what about all those other people who look exactly like him, who didn't make it out of
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.580]   the camp?
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:25.500]   I mean, it's projection, but it seemed like, and this perhaps is also just combining with
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:32.740]   Matt's search for meaning, is it seemed like it was a regular day for them in the picture.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.740]   It didn't seem like...
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:40.020]   I mean, I'm not sure what I expect to see, what suffering looks like, but it's almost
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.380]   like there's no celebration.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.140]   - I've never seen a picture of actually liberation be celebratory.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.220]   It's true.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.500]   It's really true.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:53.460]   So what do you make sense, and I apologize to take a step into that moment in history.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:28:04.460]   How do you make sense of the Holocaust, of Nazi Germany, that such things could be committed
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.700]   by human beings to each other?
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.820]   Is it religion?
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.440]   Is it the thirst for power?
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.340]   Is it the madness of crowds somehow carrying us forward?
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.180]   - I mean, for me, it's multi-causal.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.160]   I don't think there's one reason.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.380]   One of the things, especially there, has to do with the special nature of antisemitism,
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.300]   which is, let's put that to one side for the moment.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.320]   The second is, I think human beings are fundamentally split.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.060]   They are mostly good, except when put under certain pressures.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.700]   My first explanation for hatred is as follows.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.500]   Go to a playground.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.660]   What happens when a new kid comes on the playground?
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.420]   Do the other kids say, "Oh, let's go share our toys with the new kid"?
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.420]   No.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.940]   They say, "Oh, who's that stranger?
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.060]   And let's go get him."
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.020]   Because otherness is built into our genetic...
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.380]   I mean, we're tribal by nature.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.700]   And we see people form tribes all the time of different kinds.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.380]   I asked you before if you were a chess player.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.540]   And when I was a kid, I'm playing in tournaments.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.220]   And I didn't do it for that long, and I didn't do it that well.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.940]   But when I was, it was like the whole world was divided into people who could play chess
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.380]   and people who couldn't play chess, which is ridiculous if you think about it, as though
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.040]   that's the way you divide the world.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.340]   But we tend to do that.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.580]   And the Jews were always the identifiable other.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.780]   There were Frenchmen and Jews.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.060]   There were Russians and Jews.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.860]   There were Germans and Jews.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:41.980]   The great blessing of America is that there's no identifiable other quite that way, is that
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.300]   there's all these minorities and no...
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.420]   There's not an American and a something.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:55.240]   But once you have that identifiable other, and you have a long history of blaming that
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.560]   identifiable other for all the ills that befall you...
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.500]   Of course, people still do try to form...
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.540]   You said America, they still try to form other...
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:07.500]   I mean, immigrant versus been here for a generation.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.060]   There's so many ways to slice it.
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.060]   We still try to find ways.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:15.460]   It's just more difficult in America because there's so many sub-tribes, hierarchies of
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.860]   tribes upon tribes.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.860]   You're absolutely right.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:23.300]   And I was moving fast because I didn't want to get bogged down in all the very difficult...
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.700]   It's true, I tried...
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.180]   You're hoping I wouldn't mention that tribalism happens in America too.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.180]   I was skating.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.120]   When you're on thin ice, your safety is in your speed.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.300]   So I was trying to move fast.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:41.840]   But for most of history in Eastern Western Europe, not obviously in Asia, but in Eastern
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.440]   Western Europe, Jews were the ones who like, "They're not like us.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.060]   They're clearly not like us."
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:54.940]   And in addition, there's a peculiar quality, and I don't know, I wonder what you'll think
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.940]   of this explanation.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:00.860]   But there's a peculiar quality to antisemitism that is unlike any other hatred that I know
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:05.460]   of, which is Jews are both superhuman and subhuman.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.700]   They're vermin, the Nazis thought of them as vermin, and yet they control the world.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:15.420]   And there was an English scholar named Hyman Maccabee who said the reason that that's so
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.860]   is the myth that Jews killed God.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.860]   They killed Jesus.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.260]   And to kill a God, you have to be superhumanly evil.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.500]   You can't just be bad, otherwise you can't kill a God.
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:35.260]   So there is some like supercharged evil sense that people got from that about Jews that
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.620]   still inheres.
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.020]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:43.980]   A lot of the way we formulate the other in terms of tribes is often they're subhuman
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:48.140]   and they're here to steal our resources, like on the playground.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:54.020]   But to be both is a fascinating construction.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.740]   Do you agree with Solzhenitsyn that all of us have the capacity for evil?
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.580]   A hundred percent, runs through every human heart.
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.900]   I have no doubt about it.
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:09.980]   And I know, as you probably do, but I probably know more both because of what I do and because
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:16.580]   I have lived a lot longer than you, I know a lot of religious leaders who people thought
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:21.380]   or think are above the human, and they are emphatically not.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.460]   They're not.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.580]   Some of them have done horrible things and they've used their position to do horrible
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.980]   things.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:32.300]   And it's because nobody, there is no perfect saint.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:38.320]   There's no, you know, I mean, all through history you discover all these saintly characters
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.540]   that we worship, the people who actually knew them around them, some liked them and some
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.400]   didn't.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.060]   People are complicated, all of us.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:51.500]   And the tough thing is, the thing that's the toughest for me is it's not very always clear
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.860]   what is good and what is evil.
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:03.420]   Because certainly if you just look at history, and it's not always propaganda, I really believe
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:12.100]   that some part of Stalin thought he was doing good, legitimately.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.740]   And it makes you ask a question of yourself.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:20.100]   For those of us who want to do good in the world, am I actually doing good?
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.300]   And that's a really difficult question.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.700]   So like in the technology sphere, for example, in this dream of creating technology that
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.220]   will do some good, am I actually doing good?
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.620]   - So I have a question about that myself.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.660]   Not about Stalin, I'm sure that Stalin thought so.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.860]   Stalin does not strike me from what I know of him as somebody given to a lot of self-doubt.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:46.580]   But the question with AI to me is actually, it goes back to the God question, which is,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:53.940]   if we have an appreciation of the limitations of our own intelligence, that we know that
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:59.980]   just like we can only hear certain things and see certain colors, how much of the world
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:05.200]   is inaccessible to us because of the way our brains are constructed?
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.060]   How can we possibly have any confidence that we can create things that in certain ways
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:16.260]   are far more intelligent than we are and control them the way we think is best?
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:21.940]   Seems to me a hubris that might end up being destructive.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:22.940]   - Definitely.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:28.660]   Well, any sentence with the word hubris in it is going to end badly when implemented
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.100]   at scale.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.060]   But there is also beauty.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:37.700]   So if you approach it with humility, there is a sense, I don't want to over romanticize
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:43.260]   it, but there is a legged robot right behind you, which is hilarious.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:53.180]   So there's a magic, I don't have kids, I would love to have kids, but there's a magic to
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:59.560]   bringing robots to life that it feels like you are a mini-God.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:04.860]   Because you just breathe life into an entity that operates in this world, especially when
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:10.180]   they have legs and they move in this way that's in the case of the four-legged robots, like
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:15.220]   a dog, that I think, I don't think I'm over romanticizing it.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.860]   The feeling is like you would with a child.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.900]   You just gave birth, like, holy crap, this is a living thing.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.860]   I wonder what he or she are thinking about.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.580]   - By the way, I'm not at all insensible to how remarkable it must feel to create that.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:35.780]   I'm actually worried in part about how remarkable it feels to create that, because to maintain
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:42.860]   humility and perspective when it's such a fantastic thing is what's difficult.
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:50.540]   And I think also because creativity is both part of what it is to be human, and it's very
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:56.380]   much part of the legacy of Western civilization and the legacy of having a creator God.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:02.020]   If you have a tradition where God is known primarily through what God creates, so the
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:06.380]   first debate I ever had, since we talked about humor and God and creating, let me give you
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.420]   my one God-creating joke.
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:14.340]   Because the first debate I ever had on religion and science was with Stephen Jay Gould.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:18.640]   And it was wonderful, 'cause he had a deep interest in religion, and his interest was
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:26.500]   actually not to say religion is terrible, but I started with this joke, and I think
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.500]   it made the debate go a little bit easier.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.900]   So the time has come when human beings can do everything that God can do.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.500]   And a scientist looks up at heaven and says, "God, look, you were great in your day, and
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.420]   we thank you for everything you did, but now we don't need you."
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.660]   And God says, "Really, you don't need me?"
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.460]   He says, "No, we can do everything you did."
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.140]   God says, "Everything?"
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.340]   And the human being says, "Yeah, we can do everything."
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.780]   God says, "Okay, can you create a human being?"
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.780]   And the scientist goes, "Yeah."
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:52.780]   God says, "From dirt?"
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:53.780]   And the scientist goes, "Yeah."
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:54.780]   He says, "Okay, let me see."
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.300]   The scientist reaches down, scoops up some dirt, and God says, "Uh-uh, uh-uh, get your
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.300]   own dirt."
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.740]   But the idea is that a creator God impels us to create, too.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:10.860]   But let me bring up Nietzsche, who proclaimed that God is dead.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.660]   Is belief in God slowly disappearing from our world, do you think?
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.380]   And what kind of impact does that have on society?
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.860]   You wrote that religion is not our enemy.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.860]   Before the Western faiths captured the heart of our world, there was cruelty, carnage,
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.860]   and destruction.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:31.340]   In the 20th century, when religion ceased to be a force of international politics, the
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:36.380]   scale of human slaughter was far beyond anything human beings have ever known.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.500]   What is the world like when we take religion out of it?
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.720]   I mean, I think Nietzsche was largely right.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.180]   It wasn't a statement about God.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:49.140]   It was a statement about God's presence in the world.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:57.100]   And I think that that's largely true, that God is not a force in a lot of Western society.
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:06.780]   And I believe that if the force of nihilism has no clear counter without an idea that
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:12.900]   we're all here for a purpose, and that our lives are inherently meaningful, and that
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:17.540]   there's a God who wishes us to be better.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.700]   So I worry a lot about it.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:24.260]   And I think that the sort of optimism that things are just gonna get better and better
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:28.380]   is what one philosopher called cut flower ethics.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.780]   That is, we're still living off the morals that religion gave us, but now that they're
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:36.860]   separate from the soil that gave birth to them, I see them wilting.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:41.460]   So this kind of optimism for the future of human civilization, you think, is in part
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:45.060]   grounded in a religious society?
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.260]   I really do believe that.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.740]   I mean, it was religion that, the Greeks looked back at the golden age of the past.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.020]   It was the Jews who said, no, the golden age is in the future, right?
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.740]   It's the Messiah.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:39:00.220]   And I think that that idea that we're moving towards something better, which I really believe
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:05.660]   humanity can do, and absent destroying ourselves will do.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:10.820]   I mean, I'm very excited about the technology that I won't live to see.
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.220]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.140]   And that excitement is a kind of religious excitement, 'cause there's a reason to preserve
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.140]   this whole thing.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:22.900]   Absolutely, 'cause I really think, I know this sounds absurdly anthropomorphic, but
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.220]   I really think God is cheering us on.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.940]   I feel like this is why we're here.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:34.900]   We're here to grow in soul and to grow each other in soul.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.820]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.580]   So what do you think the world...
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:47.300]   So if we just think of this force of nihilism that's contending with the force of faith-based
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:54.420]   optimism, what do you make of the atrocities in the 20th century?
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:40:02.140]   Do you think at its core, it's part of human nature and has nothing to do with religion
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.420]   or not religion?
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:07.420]   Or do you think you can assign this kind of nihilistic view of the world?
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.700]   I think it has to do with a religion that doesn't make ethical demands.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:20.580]   That is, for Stalin and for Hitler, they both had religions, in a sense, but they were religions
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.740]   that didn't make ethical demands for the other.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.500]   I mean, 36 times the Torah talks about the stranger.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:33.740]   The point is, it's trying to educate people away from their natural inclination towards
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.420]   distrusting and disliking the other.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.820]   And it's a lot of work.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.020]   That's really difficult to do.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:50.260]   But if you have a tribal passion and not a universal ethic, then you're in trouble.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:54.620]   Well, the Jewish tribe is a very strong tribe.
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:41:00.900]   So how do you make sense of this mention of the stranger versus the power of the tribe,
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:05.140]   which is the whole point, not the point, but the mechanism of tradition propagates the
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.140]   tribe?
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.140]   Well, both.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.260]   I mean, the Torah does not start with Jews.
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.000]   It starts with Adam and Eve.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.900]   That's a way of saying, "Yeah, this is going to be a story about a people, but understand
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.780]   that prior to a kind of people, there are people.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:24.340]   I'm a human being before I'm a Jew."
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:30.700]   And in fact, the Jewish new year, the Muslim new year starts with Muhammad's journey, and
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.100]   the Christian new year starts with Jesus' birth.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:38.060]   The Jewish new year starts with the creation of the world, because the idea is, yes, this
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:44.820]   is a particularist tradition, but it makes a universal statement, which is all of humanity
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:49.820]   is a child, are in the image of God, are children of God.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:57.520]   I think that the idea of Judaism was to try to exemplify a certain way of making that
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.300]   statement over and over again.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:04.580]   And I want to say one other thing about chosenness that's very name droppy, but when I tell you
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.020]   how I got there, it won't be as name droppy.
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:14.300]   So my brother is a professor at Emory, and so is the Dalai Lama actually teaches at Emory,
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.820]   although he no longer does because he's too old to go to Emory, but for many years taught
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:18.820]   at Emory.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.980]   And so my brother brought us...
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.340]   He's the head of the ethics center at Emory.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.340]   He's a bioethicist.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.200]   So he brought a bunch of students to Dharamsala to meet with the Dalai Lama.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.000]   So I went to India, I was on sabbatical then anyway, I met my brother there and we had
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.820]   a chance to meet with the Dalai Lama.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.660]   Okay, that was the name drop.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.820]   So we're sitting in the...
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.620]   Before he speaks to the students, he was speaking to us, but not because I just wanted to make
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.100]   it clear, not because he said, "Oh, I got to talk to that rabbi."
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.260]   We just happened to be...
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.540]   I happened to glom along with my brother.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:52.260]   We sit down, the first thing he says is he points at me and says, "What's this about
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.060]   the chosen people anyway?"
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.060]   So, and he had...
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:02.420]   By the way, he had asked that I give a lecture, which I did later to his monks about how Jews
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.900]   survived in the diaspora.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.420]   So it's not like he doesn't know about Jude, he knows a lot about it, but he says to me
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.420]   right away with...
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.980]   So I said, "Yes, Jews believe that they were chosen for a certain mission in this world,
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.980]   that doesn't mean other people weren't chosen for other sorts of things.
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:16.980]   They certainly...
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:20.140]   I mean, it seems to me that other people believe they're chosen for things too."
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.620]   He burst out laughing and said, "Yeah, we also think we're chosen."
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.620]   So I think it's universal.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.660]   So the idea is that no tribe is better than...
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.140]   Better, no.
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:38.940]   From a Jewish perspective, you're chosen for a thing, but that doesn't make you better.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:39.940]   No.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:44.340]   The only place where the betters came in, honestly, historically, if I'm gonna be honest,
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.660]   was not with the idea that you...
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:53.900]   But it was when Jews were small, persecuted, the way that you take this sort of psychic
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:59.100]   revenge is by saying, "No, we're better than our persecutors even."
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:03.660]   But the idea is, yeah, different people have different missions, which is...
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:08.080]   I mean, there was a Jewish philosopher, Franz Rosenzweig, who used to say...
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.500]   He didn't know very much about Islam.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:15.020]   He used to say, "Judaism is the sun and Christianity was the rays of the sun."
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.300]   Judaism introduced the idea of God and Christianity brought it to the world.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.220]   Can you speak to this difference?
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:28.220]   What is the difference and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.620]   The religious family part is different.
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:38.700]   And the greatest difference, which I talked about in the Eric Weinstein podcast, is that
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:44.220]   Islam and Judaism are more similar in a lot of ways than Judaism and Christianity.
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:52.340]   The reason that that is so is Christianity in its core is not a religion of law.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.920]   The reason it's not a religion of law is because it grew up in the Roman Empire, so law was
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   taken care of.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.420]   I mean, Jesus didn't have to create civil law 'cause you had Roman law.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:06.780]   Muhammad and Moses created a religion in the desert where there was no law, so you have
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:12.020]   to create a religion of law, otherwise you have anarchy.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:16.900]   And that's why in a lot of ways, like there was never a separation of church and state
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.180]   in Islam or Judaism.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.140]   That was a gift that Christianity gave the world.
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.540]   And it could do it because of "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's."
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.700]   But when Moses came along, there was no Caesar.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.060]   When Muhammad came along, there was no Caesar.
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:34.340]   So historically, the traditions shaped differently.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:42.940]   But all three of them have this core, I think, the single most important statement and insight
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:48.460]   in all of human history, which is that every human being is in the image of God.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:54.080]   And if you really believe that, that's a transformative belief.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:58.940]   So that means you should love thy neighbor as yourself.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.620]   As yourself, which comes from Leviticus, comes straight from the Torah.
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:06.860]   - So I don't know if you know, I've been chatting with Omar Suleiman.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.140]   I don't know if you know who that is.
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.940]   He's an imam in Dallas, great guy.
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:16.060]   I enjoy his interfaith dialogues that he engages in.
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:19.820]   And do you ever do that kind of talk with Christians, with Muslims?
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.620]   - Yes, often, often.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:26.780]   - I mean, I do whenever I at least listen to them in the context of these kinds of conversations.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:32.540]   There's so much love and humor and empathy and appreciation.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:37.620]   And also ability to make fun of the quirks of the little--
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.620]   - Of one's own.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.020]   - Of one's own communities.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:46.540]   So it's not necessarily the depths or the details of the traditions, but these are communities
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:51.620]   and they're full of people and they're full of weird people, 'cause we're all weird.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:57.580]   And so there is very particular flavors of weirdness that emerge and they can make fun
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.100]   of them.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.540]   And in that way, they can talk about some beautiful ideas.
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:07.220]   So I mean, I don't know, do you engage in these kinds of things?
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.060]   What do you learn from them?
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.580]   - So one of the things I learned is exactly what you said, that personalities that you
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:18.100]   think are unique to your own community, in fact, they exist in all sorts of communities.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:23.340]   And religious communities in particular draw, I think, some interesting personalities.
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:33.620]   And also that the, especially as clergy, some of the pressures that you feel are shared.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:38.100]   And it's weird, again, it has to do with that tribal association.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:44.220]   There's almost like there's an understanding among clergy because they have similar straight,
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:49.260]   and it's a strange role in the following way.
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.020]   It's one that you never escape.
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:58.100]   That is, you're not my lawyer at the supermarket, but you are my rabbi at the supermarket.
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.820]   I mean, it doesn't matter why you're there.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.740]   That's not an escapable role.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:14.180]   And every religious leader is aware of that strange assumption of stepping into something
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:16.420]   that you can never step out of.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:25.500]   - You're also the source where people go to think about the deepest question of our lives
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.460]   and our universe.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:32.620]   And so that's some heavy, when people are suffering, they look to you for answers.
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.100]   - I mean, every privilege comes with a cost of one kind or another.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:41.060]   The reason you get to be in that role is exactly because you get the privilege of being there
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:44.180]   at crucial moments in people's lives.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:51.820]   I mean, the fact that I get to marry people and get to give eulogies for people and come
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:56.100]   to the hospital, it's inexpressible.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:00.740]   I have this joke with people that I know that like, when I'm sitting on the couch and it's
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.180]   Saturday night, I don't wanna get up and go to a wedding.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.180]   I really don't.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.660]   I wanna sit there and watch Netflix like everybody else.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:11.380]   But when I'm actually doing the wedding, I always love it.
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.740]   Always, always, always.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:21.020]   And the reason is that I don't think, I mean, yes, people go to you for answers in calmer
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.020]   conversations.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:25.020]   Like if you asked me now, like, what's my theory of why God allows evil, I could give
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:28.060]   you a conversation about it.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:32.700]   But they really go for presence and comfort, not really for answers.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:37.380]   When someone's suffering, an answer doesn't make them unsuffer.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.220]   It's just, they wanna know they're not alone.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:45.820]   To be heard and just to feel things in silence together.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:51.820]   In terms of weddings and marriage, what's the role of that call?
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.740]   I need to take some notes here.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:59.340]   What's the role of marriage in human existence?
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:05.940]   It is first of all, to teach you how to care for someone unlike you, which could be anyone
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.720]   you marry.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.940]   And I think it's to create a home and a family.
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.740]   So there's a commitment to it, so care for a long time.
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:16.860]   Right, exactly.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:21.060]   And also when couples come to me and they say, "We don't need to be married because
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.740]   it really won't change how we think about ourselves and our relationship."
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:24.740]   I say, "Then that's true.
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.500]   It might not, but it will change how everyone else looks at you."
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:32.260]   And because it changes how everyone else looks at you, it changes you.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.340]   'Cause it's one thing to say, "This is my partner."
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.340]   It's another thing to say, "This is my husband."
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:42.820]   You say, "This is my husband," that means we've made a real commitment to this.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.820]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:52.820]   What do you, do you worry that there's a dissolution of that as well in terms of how, you know,
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:59.020]   as religion dissipates, it loosens its hold on society, loosens its impact on society.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.340]   Do you worry about that?
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.420]   I worry about it.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:07.820]   I do think that it is possible that we're going, rather than a dissolution, we're going
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:13.180]   through a transition that is different kinds of families and different configurations of
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.180]   families.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:20.260]   That is, I see some of that, but I also do see, it's less a dissolution of marriage than
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.860]   it is of the idea of commitment.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.940]   And I'll give you like a simple example.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:31.900]   When I was growing up, a player on a sports team was always on that team.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:35.580]   And you rooted for the team because you knew the players for 20 years.
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:40.700]   Now there are very good reasons, starting with Curt Flood, why people got free agency
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.900]   and they can move around and it's better for the players.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.220]   I understand all that.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:48.340]   And I am not, I'm not saying, "Oh, they should continue."
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:56.460]   But just like people move jobs and they move sports teams and they change careers, they
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.620]   change partners.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:06.700]   And there is a diminishment of the commitment to commitment that I actually think has serious
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.860]   societal consequences and that I am worried about.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.460]   Yeah, there's a cost to that.
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:16.700]   I don't know what it is about commitment that's beautiful.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:20.340]   Because some of the deepest friendships I have is when we've gone through some shit
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.340]   together.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.340]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:26.400]   And so like the hard times, going through hard times together, especially when the hard
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:31.820]   times are between the two of you, that, I mean, that's always a risk.
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:36.460]   But if you can find a way through, that can bond you stronger.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.180]   That's the fascinating thing about human relations.
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:39.180]   There's no question.
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:44.980]   And even if it doesn't keep you forever, you still have a connection that doesn't, that
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.580]   exists.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.860]   So I can give you one, you said, "What is it about commitment?"
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:52.020]   I'll give you one, I think, beautiful answer.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:58.480]   Someone's asked Rabbi Soloveitchik, who is a great thinker and leader in the Orthodox
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.240]   community in the 20th century.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.160]   They said, "You know, I go from religion to religion.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.680]   I just take what I think is beautiful in it."
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:10.000]   And his answer was that you're treating religion like a nomad.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.440]   He said, "Nomads go from place to place and they eat what they want and they move on."
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.280]   He says, "Farmers stay in one place.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.840]   The difference is farmers make things grow."
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.460]   And I think that that's true also when you think about the relationships you have.
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:27.980]   Things have grown out of the relationships that you've invested in, that you farmed,
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:35.300]   basically, that can't exist in fly-by-night relationships.
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:38.700]   - Can you talk about, can we talk about the Torah?
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.780]   - Yes.
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:40.780]   - What is it?
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:46.020]   And is it the literal word of God?
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.020]   Easy questions today.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:52.280]   - Well, the Torah is the five books of Moses written in Hebrew.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:57.920]   I, like most, I think, modern rabbis, non-Orthodox or non-literalist rabbis will tell you that
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.360]   it's a product of human beings.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:08.440]   And I believe that they are inspired by God, but it's clear to me that it's a human product.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:15.920]   And I think that people who study modern biblical criticism, it's really hard to study modern,
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.980]   criticism gives a wrong impression.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:24.000]   I would say modern scholarship on the Bible and not appreciate the fact that it even has
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.680]   levels of language.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:33.520]   I mean, it's just like if you read today somebody writing like Shakespeare, you would say, "This
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.200]   isn't, it's like English has developed.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.200]   It's different.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.440]   It's not the English we speak today."
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:42.360]   And if you study the Bible and you know Hebrew well enough, you even see that this was written
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.840]   over hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.380]   It is a holy book.
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:53.000]   And I like the idea that it is, what you say in Hebrew is Torah min ha-shamayim and not
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.200]   Torah min sinai.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.840]   That is the Torah is from heaven, but it's not from Sinai.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:03.600]   So it has its origin beyond us, but it has things in it that I think, and this is one
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:11.480]   of the things that was a huge controversy at my congregation when I started to do same-sex
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:12.480]   marriages.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:19.040]   There are some people who try to argue that the Torah does not forbid them.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:24.160]   Whether it does or not, it seems to me we understand things that were not understood
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.920]   in the ancient world about gender and sexuality.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.920]   And so-
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:36.000]   So you think that in the scripture, in the words, you can find the kind of spirit that
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.040]   supports the idea of gay marriage?
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.040]   Well, that's, yes.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.160]   My argument is that you criticize the Torah by the Torah.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:54.240]   That is, it gives you the understanding that you use to evaluate its own claims.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:57.640]   And I think that Judaism, by the way, has always done that because it's clear that there
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:04.540]   are things in the Torah that the rabbis changed, altered, grew, expanded, diminished.
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:08.120]   I think that's what it is to be part of a living tradition.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:15.440]   You wrote in your book, Why Faith Matters, "Walt Whitman wrote that in order for there
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.520]   to be great books, there must be great readers.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:23.160]   For a book to remain powerful throughout generations, it cannot have a single meaning.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:26.760]   Scripture like great poetry is not reducible to other words.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:33.480]   That is, one cannot paraphrase it and capture the totality of its meaning."
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:38.780]   So how the heck do you capture the meaning of the words in scripture?
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:41.160]   Is it an ongoing process through the centuries?
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.160]   Is that essentially what it is?
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.160]   Yes, exactly so.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:53.960]   It's a continual conversation of sages, scholars, readers, strugglers, seekers, mystics, visionaries,
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.480]   all of them making a contribution.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:00.000]   I mean, I write a weekly Torah column for the Jerusalem Post.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.400]   Now, what is there left to say?
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:08.380]   But every week what I do is I start opening books and seeing what people say and it starts
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:14.240]   to percolate and you realize that you're entering this conversation that's been going on for
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:23.960]   thousands of years with remarkable minds and it's constantly fertile in new insights.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:27.160]   So yes, that's what it is to be part of a tradition.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.280]   Why do people keep writing love poems?
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:33.120]   We should have figured out love by this point already.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.720]   I use the analogy sometimes of diet books.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.240]   If any diet worked, there would be one book.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.040]   There'd be one book and you'd be done.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.720]   You mentioned this fascinating story that you were part of.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.480]   You were a part of several controversies in your life.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.120]   I've had a few.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:56.080]   So for someone who walks with grace through the fire, you sure have found yourself in
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.640]   a lot of fires.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:03.360]   One of them, can you tell me the story of your views on gay marriage, the underlying
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:10.660]   principles that led you to fight this battle of defending gay marriage in the Jewish community?
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:19.500]   So I'm part of a congregation that is really politically split and split not only politically
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:24.080]   but split in terms of origin.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.840]   We have a lot of Jews from the Middle East, from Iran, a lot of Persian Jews, a lot of
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:34.480]   Jews from Israel, some from Mexico, from other places and many that grew up in LA.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.560]   Do you have any Russian Jews, the best kind?
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:43.380]   I have a few Russian Jews, not as many as I should, but we'll work on that.
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:51.120]   But what happened was increasingly I became uncomfortable with people who would come to
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:58.200]   me and say, "This is the only kind of person I can love."
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:02.780]   It's not the same question as an intermarriage, as a Jew marrying a non-Jew, because you could
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:03.780]   find a Jew to love.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:08.080]   You may not have found, but you could.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.040]   That's a whole separate question.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:15.400]   But I would have men in my office primarily, a couple of women, they would say, "This is
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:20.400]   the only kind of person that I can enter into an intimate relationship with.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:26.400]   How can it be that my religion has no room for me?"
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.520]   And that was very persuasive to me.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:36.080]   But I knew that it was gonna be explosive in my community.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:40.120]   When, by the way, it finally happened, it was literally on the front page of the New
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.440]   York and the LA Times, it was that explosive.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:47.000]   So it was not a small controversy.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:55.160]   And so what I did was I started to teach classes, not that many people came, about homosexuality
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.640]   and Jewish tradition and so on.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.680]   It's funny, much, much less about lesbianism.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.120]   I'm talking about in terms of the sources and so on.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:07.920]   It's almost always about homosexuality.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:14.200]   And then I got ready to send out a letter.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:22.680]   And I said to my daughter, who at the time was maybe 10 or 11, now in her mid-20s, I
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.880]   said, "Look, honey, when you go to school tomorrow," or whatever it was, I said, "People
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.680]   might be saying bad things about your dad, and I just want you to be prepared for that."
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.880]   She said, "Why?"
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:38.600]   And I said, "Because I'm gonna start doing same-sex marriages."
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.200]   And she looked at me quizzically and said, "What took you so long?"
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.200]   And I thought, really her face was like I said to her, "I'm gonna start marrying blonde-haired
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.720]   people to brown-haired people."
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.380]   It's like she really did not understand why there was an issue.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:59.840]   And I thought, "That's exactly why, because I know that this is, it's generational, people
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.120]   are raised with it, they have it deep in there, but it's not really right.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.800]   It's just not right."
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:15.880]   But if you could just look back to that journey, how difficult is it to make these decisions
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.880]   a principle?
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:23.240]   So, because you have to think about that in order to think about such decisions you yet
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.600]   might still have to make in the future.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   And I will tell you one thing I did wrong with that, and one thing I did right.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:36.800]   The thing I did right was I waited until in the communities where people objected to it,
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:45.120]   I had enough people whose kids had come out so that I had parents of kids who'd come out
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:50.720]   to refer later on other parents to, so that they wouldn't feel like they were the only
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.720]   ones.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.120]   Because once I announced it, as I thought would happen, a bunch of kids came out and
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:59.960]   said, "Now that the rabbi said this, mom, dad, I want you to know I'm gay."
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.920]   And when the parents came to me, I could say, "Well, listen, you're not alone.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.760]   This person also you can go to."
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   That I did right.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:11.000]   What I did wrong was I don't think the classes were enough, and I don't think enough people
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.360]   were prepared.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.720]   And I think part of the explosion was shock.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.560]   And I should have prepared even more.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:25.040]   The words you used to talk about it, the way you thought about it, was it more scholarly
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.400]   in the Jewish tradition, or did you go to the feeling?
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.760]   No, I went to the feeling.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:39.680]   I said, "Kvod ha-briot," which means respect or honor for God's creations, and caring for
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.900]   other human beings, and understanding.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:51.880]   It wasn't scholarly, because I knew that the objections were not scholarly objections.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:59.200]   And I had many beautiful and also painful stories as a result, some of which can be
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.320]   told and some of which really can't.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:10.360]   But what I tried to impress also on people was how painful it is to not be able to tell
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.720]   the world, even your own parents, who you are.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.320]   And your sexuality is not a trivial part of who you are.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.280]   I mean, it's core to people.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.360]   So it's one of the reasons why I'd evoke such reactions.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:28.040]   But I would say to them, the same reason that you're reacting so strongly tells you how
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.520]   strongly...
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:34.800]   Anyway, it was a very powerful experience.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:41.800]   And for that, I feel good about it.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.560]   Afterwards, the other thing that I, again, said to my daughter afterwards, after it all
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:50.720]   died down, and after all the bad things were said, I told her the Churchill one said that
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.280]   it's exhilarating to be shot at without result.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.440]   If you go into a battle and you make it through and you're still okay, that's good.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.760]   - The problem is when you're in the battle, you don't know.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.920]   - No, you don't know.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:10.000]   - So how did it feel like, I mean, looking back, you've been, to use the word, canceled
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.560]   a couple of times.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:17.640]   I guess when you're dealing with the most difficult of questions, just as a human being,
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.480]   for a community that you really deeply care about, some part of it saying that you have
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.480]   failed.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:30.200]   - I wasn't canceled the way, like I didn't lose my job, didn't lose my home, but I hurt
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.080]   people that I cared about.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:38.360]   And that was the hard, like I went into this to be someone who brings people together.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:44.160]   And then I would sit there and do, even now, like as you're well aware with stuff that's
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:52.760]   going on now, I sit there and people are really upset at me who I either am or used to be
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.400]   close to.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:00.400]   - Do those people in time come around?
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.600]   When you look now, 'cause those are real feelings in the moment, and we can learn that about
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:11.160]   social media, people, especially during COVID, there's this intensity of feeling about stuff.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:17.360]   And have you learned something about the passing of feeling that turns into wisdom?
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.700]   - No question about it.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:24.860]   This sermon I gave this Saturday was about how Moses came down the mountain, he saw the
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:27.640]   golden calf and he broke the tablets.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.120]   If he'd sat with it for a little while, he probably wouldn't have broken the tablets.
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.420]   But the instant reaction is always anger.
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:40.160]   And in our age, unfortunately, the instant reaction gets put on social media forever
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.400]   and ever and ever.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.640]   And by the way, once you've actually said that, it becomes harder to back down.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:52.240]   If you keep quiet for a day or two, then you can back down because you haven't put yourself
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.240]   out there.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:57.520]   But once you've said, "This is terrible what you did," it's harder to write and say, "I'm
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.400]   sorry, I shouldn't have said that."
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.240]   - Yeah, so it almost becomes...
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:10.480]   I mean, I actually, it's a really powerful statement that the downside of saying something
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:18.120]   on the internet is that it actually pulls you into this current.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.560]   You both create the current and it pulls you into it to where it's actually very hard to
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.600]   escape.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:27.520]   So when two days later you feel different, there's a momentum.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.400]   There's now a tribe of people that feel this way and there's a momentum with it.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.840]   - There's a momentum and also you don't wanna betray your own tribe 'cause then people will
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.400]   get upset at you.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:42.540]   I really think that a lot of the antagonism is not so much that you don't wanna give ground
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.840]   to the people who oppose you, it's that you don't wanna break with the people who are
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.360]   behind you.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.680]   And that's really hard.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.560]   - Can you tell the story of this recent controversy?
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.560]   - Sure, why not?
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.960]   - The sermon you just gave, you went to the Superbowl.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.800]   I think a lot of people would relate to this because to me personally, I apologize to anybody
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.600]   who was hurt by this, the absurdity of it is deeply intense.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.740]   - So here's the story.
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:12.160]   The LA County mandates masking children in school and all of the kids in our school are
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:15.640]   masked and many of the parents are extremely upset about that.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.220]   I will just leave that at that.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.480]   I went to the Superbowl.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:29.640]   There were 70,000 people, Frank Luntz, whom we know, wonderful guy, gave me a ticket.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:32.240]   And so I was at the Superbowl.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.080]   I maybe saw two masks among the 70,000 people.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.120]   I didn't even think about it, which was foolish on my part, no question.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:43.200]   I took a picture of myself unmasked at the Superbowl.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:49.720]   And people were, I mean, many, many people thought, "Oh, great, wonderful, glad you're
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.880]   having a good time," so on and so forth.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.120]   I don't want to diminish at all the many people who said that.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.880]   A lot of people were livid.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.880]   They were livid.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:04.320]   And they weren't, what was instructive about it was they didn't say, nobody wrote me a
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.880]   private note and said, "I think that this was a bad idea.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.320]   You should have thought about this."
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.440]   No, they were, "You're a hypocrite.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.440]   You're a clown.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.440]   You're an idiot.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.440]   How could you do this?
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.440]   This is a disgrace.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.440]   This is," that kind of thing.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.440]   - They say that publicly.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.440]   - Oh yeah.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:22.080]   And I, on my Instagram, you can still see, I left the remarks up because I really thought
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.240]   it was important.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:28.180]   If I started, I only deleted the really vile comments because I thought that shouldn't
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.180]   stay up.
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:33.760]   But I left them up because I thought people should see and I should remind myself what
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.760]   I did.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.760]   And I didn't want to just delete the picture as though it didn't happen, because it did
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.880]   happen and I did do it.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.760]   And I felt terrible about that.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.280]   And I felt terrible that I had, not about, I mean, the comments from Malimi weren't pleasant.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.920]   I didn't like it.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.280]   Nobody likes it.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.720]   But I felt worse that I had hurt all these people that I'm close to.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.880]   And I defended all these people who were really upset that their kids were wearing masks.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.120]   And now their kid says, "Why does the rabbi have to wear a mask?"
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.360]   - Well, first of all, it is tough to be a rabbi.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:11.080]   I mean, the masks to me symbolize these kinds of discussions, symbolize not necessarily
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.840]   the issues at hand, but the intensity of feeling.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.580]   And people are really struggling.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:16.920]   People are in pain.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.000]   They're lonely.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.220]   The uncertainty of it, you don't know who to trust.
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:25.880]   Everything's under question, the institutions, even the scientific institutions.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.000]   And there's all these conspiracy theories flying around.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.360]   You don't know who to believe.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.640]   And there's people just yelling at each other and politics is weaved into this whole thing
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.640]   in some messy way.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:42.220]   And you just get, I mean, honestly, it's just like legit, simple, just frustration going
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:50.440]   back to marriage of just hanging out with the kids and your wife, husband, just the
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.280]   stress is building up over time, no release.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:58.600]   And just people want to tell you when the rabbi is not wearing a mask, even though it's
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:03.840]   at the damn Superbowl, maybe you want to comment on the Superbowl part, which is awesome.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.840]   But anyway.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:09.280]   - But it released clearly a dam of all the kinds of feelings that you're talking about.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.640]   - So how do you then write a sermon?
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:18.960]   - So what I did was I didn't answer on social media because I knew that I wouldn't be able
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.160]   to formulate it the way I wanted.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.360]   And I was gonna wait and I was gonna be able to give a longer, I mean, the sermon is 15
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:30.240]   minutes, not that long, but I wanted to be able to give a longer answer as opposed to
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:33.200]   a tweet.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:41.120]   And so I was really, I mean, I tried to make two points during the sermon and also I published
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.320]   the text of it, which I never do, 'cause I never speak from a text.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.120]   I always speak from either notes or not even from notes, but this time I thought it was
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:50.720]   really important that I have a text out there too, so that people could actually look over
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.360]   it.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.640]   And I just wanted to make two points, one of which was that I really feel terrible.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:03.640]   And I did, that all these people were hurt and that there is this contradiction between
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.000]   the way I acted and the way they want me to act.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.280]   And I also think, by the way, I didn't speak about this, but I also think that there are
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:14.120]   some people who just don't like the idea of a rabbi being at the Super Bowl.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.400]   It's like, you're supposed to be doing rabbi stuff.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.840]   So I understand that too.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840]   But then-
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:27.160]   - Yeah, but rabbi at the Super Bowl, I mean, you are also, I hate to say it, but there's
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:32.240]   a rockstar nature to you talking to Christopher Hitchens, contending with ideas, inspiring
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.840]   so many other minds.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.040]   I mean, there's an educational aspect to this.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.040]   - I appreciate that.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.240]   - It's making ideas cool.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:42.680]   I mean, that's a very powerful, I mean, that is also the job of a rabbi.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.360]   You're not just supposed to do rabbi stuff, it's to educate your spot.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.160]   - Yeah, but I didn't do so much of that at the game.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:59.960]   So nonetheless, so, but the second part of it was I said that we have to be able to express
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.960]   our anger and disappointment better than this.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.800]   You just have to.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.000]   In part because it doesn't get you the result that you want.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:16.840]   I mean, when you scream at someone, that's not gonna get them to realize what they did.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:23.640]   And the most painful moment of it was this letter that I got from a Christian pastor
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.520]   who said, "I always admired the Jews so much, I can't believe they could be so cruel, and
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.240]   especially to a rabbi."
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:36.960]   And I thought, that's not how I want my congregation to be perceived in the world.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.640]   And by the way, some of them were from my congregation, some were, many were not from
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.240]   my congregation.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:51.680]   And I spoke about what you talked about, which is that, I mentioned before that Moses broke
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.280]   those tablets coming down the mountain.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.360]   And the Torah doesn't say what happened to the tablets, but the rabbis do.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.520]   They say that they were carried together in the ark with the second set that was intact.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:06.360]   And that we all have brokenness, communities and individuals, we have brokenness, and especially
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.700]   now.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:13.360]   And we have to learn how to give each other space to be mistaken and broken and hurt and
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.360]   all of that.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.000]   - And the cool thing when you give people that space, you feel better.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.080]   I mean, you for caring for the community, it feels better when you show empathy and
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.440]   compassion and kindness on the internet.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.080]   You'll actually feel better a week from now.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:36.120]   You'll feel much worse if you make some kind of a negative statement of principle on the
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.120]   internet.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.480]   It's almost just exclusively true.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:45.140]   So if you care about feeling good, just be kind first, be empathetic first.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:48.040]   - Almost always the case, exactly so.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:53.480]   So it's, I mean, it settled down a lot.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:14:00.760]   The most, really the single best reaction, there are people, and you can, again, you
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.740]   can go on social media, you can see all the criticisms and so on and so forth.
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:10.320]   But the single best reaction I got was from a man who came up to me right after the sermon
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.780]   and said, "I have four words for you."
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:13.780]   And I thought, "Oh no."
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:14.780]   (laughing)
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.780]   I was, I gotta confess.
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:17.280]   - Nothing good comes in fourth.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.280]   - I gotta confess.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.120]   I said, "What?"
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:23.920]   He said, "You changed my mind."
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.160]   And I thought, "Wow."
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:30.160]   And I said to him, "You know, that's so, it's like, it takes so much courage to come up
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.080]   to somebody and say that in front of them."
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.120]   And I was so grateful.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.800]   And the other thing that it tells me is, look, I've been the rabbi of that congregation for
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.280]   25 years, and I taught 10 years before that.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.480]   I've been a rabbi for a long time.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.800]   I still have a lot to learn.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.200]   - We talked a little bit about the difference between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:56.120]   Could you maybe talk about the difference between the Torah, the Bible, and the Quran?
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:03.240]   - So there's, the Hebrew Bible is actually what's called a step canon.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.200]   That is, there are the five books of the Torah.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.040]   Then there are books of history and the prophets.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:18.240]   So books like Samuel, Kings, Judges, and then the prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Ezekiel,
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.520]   so on.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.880]   And then there are what are called the writings.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:29.120]   The writings are books like Psalms, Proverbs, Job, the Megilloth, which are Esther, Daniel,
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.360]   all of those books, Ecclesiastes.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.320]   So in Hebrew, it's called the Tanakh, Torah, Nevim, Ketuvim.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.240]   The Torah, the prophets, and the writings.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.680]   And that is the Hebrew Bible.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:47.600]   Sometimes that's also called the Torah, just to be confusing, but really the Torah generally
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.920]   refers to the five books.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:56.200]   Then there is the New Testament, which the Jews don't recognize as a sacred book.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:59.680]   They recognize it as the book of another religion.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:04.840]   And I sometimes say to Christians, in order for them to really grasp this, Jesus has as
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.860]   much religious significance to Judaism as Muhammad has to Christianity.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:14.200]   That is, Jesus, although Jewish, became the founder of another religion.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.460]   And for Judaism, that's not only in as much as Christians and Jews have had a lot of interactions,
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:22.940]   but religiously, Jesus has no significance.
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.640]   Said many beautiful things, said some things I don't like so much.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.080]   Like what?
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.720]   Leave your father and mother and follow me.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.480]   I don't like that as a religious model.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.480]   Now Christians will say-
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480]   The whole love thing is pretty good.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:39.480]   They will say that I don't understand that, but that's because Christians, like Jews,
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.080]   interpret their texts different ways at different times.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:50.280]   So anyway, the Quran, which I know less well, I have read it, but I know it less well than
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:57.200]   I know the New Testament, and certainly less well, obviously, than I know the Hebrew Bible,
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:04.240]   is in some ways, parts of it are, I don't say this word, I say this word because I can't
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:09.920]   find a better descriptive word, but Muslims will not accept this, okay, is a takeoff on
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.320]   the Torah in some things.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.520]   That is, it's the same stories as the Torah, but they're different.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:19.300]   Now Jews will say, and I being a Jew will say this, that that's because Muhammad heard
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:24.240]   those stories from Jews and also heard Midrashim, which are rabbinic interpretations of those
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.680]   stories and he wrote those down.
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:30.920]   Muslims will say, no, the Jews got it wrong and Muhammad came along to correct the record
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.480]   and tell the real story.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:37.640]   But they're all telling the story of the same thing.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:43.340]   The Hebrew Bible part, the Abrahamic part, they all tell the story of the same characters,
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:49.160]   but tell them, obviously, Christians accept the Hebrew Bible as sacred scripture.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:54.880]   The Muslims retell many of the stories in the Bible.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:00.720]   What is common to all of them is that all of them are monotheistic faiths.
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:06.160]   Now in Christianity, that's more complicated because of the Trinity, but as Christianity
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:12.040]   has developed over time, it clearly presents itself and thinks of itself and is a monotheistic
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.040]   faith as well.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:17.240]   What's the role of the word in each of these religions in the scriptures?
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:23.400]   In terms of, so first of all, the role of oral traditions, the power of the exactness
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:29.040]   of the words in the scripture, does it differ or is it really within the communities it
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.040]   differs?
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:37.200]   It differs because in Christianity, the words are not all the words of Jesus.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.840]   They're the words of Jesus' disciples.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.920]   None of the books of the New Testament were written by people who met Jesus in person.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:49.080]   So they're different and therefore the, and also we don't even know sometimes the original
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:54.880]   language of some of the things in the New Testament.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.560]   In the Bible, and I understand in the Koran, but I'll speak for the Hebrew Bible, the
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:05.640]   idea is that that's lashon ha-kodesh, that's sacred language, and Hebrew is in it.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.800]   That's the language, according to the tradition, that God actually spoke to Moses, and therefore
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:15.040]   the exact words are infinitely interpretable and meaningful.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:22.360]   But the words are spoken but written by Moses and the same with Muhammad, but from memory
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.360]   or no.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.800]   There are different theories.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.040]   I won't speak for Muhammad.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.400]   You should ask.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.400]   I don't want to get that wrong.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.280]   I don't want to get another religious tradition wrong.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.620]   In Judaism, the words are written by Moses at God's dictation, basically.
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:36.880]   That's the traditional view.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.160]   There are other views that I'm happy to go into if you want to, but basically that's
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.160]   the traditional view.
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.320]   So it's pretty close.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.640]   What makes it different?
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.840]   What makes Judaism and Christianity different is Christianity has an ideal life.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.520]   Judaism doesn't have an ideal life.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.580]   Judaism has an ideal book.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:20:01.360]   So the holidays of Christianity are events in the life of God, God's birth, God's death
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.120]   and resurrection.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:08.520]   In Judaism, the holidays are all events in the life of the people, like the liberation
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:13.720]   from slavery or in the people's relationship to God, like Yom Kippur, which is a day of
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.000]   atonement.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.200]   But there are no holidays in Judaism that are events in the life of God because in Judaism,
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.440]   God doesn't have a biography.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:24.400]   God is eternal and God never came to earth.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:29.080]   And those events carry with them traditions and rules that you're to follow.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:30.080]   Yes.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:35.960]   You mentioned on one such event in scripture, yet another time you walked through the fire,
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.320]   which is with Exodus.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.080]   That was the first.
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:44.120]   And you never forget the first.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.680]   One of several controversies.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:53.720]   You spoke 20 years ago, 21 years ago now at Passover and said that, "The way the Bible
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:59.240]   describes the Exodus is not the way it happened, if it happened at all."
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.920]   So first of all, what is Exodus?
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.600]   What really happened?
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.120]   Exodus is the liberation of the Jews from Egypt and it is the central story of the Jewish
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.800]   tradition.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:16.360]   And as I've said numerous times in various places, I believe that it's based on a historical
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.360]   kernel.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.320]   I think Richard Elliott Friedman may have gotten this right in his book Exodus.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:30.360]   It may have been the Levites who left Israel, but the Bible is not a book of history.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:37.400]   I don't believe that there were 10 plagues and a split sea and 600,000 men, which makes
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:42.200]   about 2 million people, who actually, if there were 2 million people, would stretch all the
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:48.740]   way from Israel to Egypt alone, were liberated from Egypt.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:53.140]   And my point in that sermon was not actually to convince people that it didn't happen.
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:59.520]   My point in that sermon was to convince people that the historicity of the Exodus is not
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.640]   the basis of the faith of the Jewish people.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.720]   Well, what does the word historicity mean?
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.400]   In other words, the factuality of it.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.880]   It can be true without being factual.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:10.480]   So you're not supposed to read it as facts?
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.680]   Well, I don't read it as fact.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:13.840]   I don't read it as a history book.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.400]   I said, "Look," I was talking, again, to a congregation that had many Iranians.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.740]   I said, "You experienced the truth of the Exodus in your own life.
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:29.380]   There was a regime that wanted to destroy you, and you miraculously escaped before it
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.380]   did."
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:40.020]   And so a myth is something that may not have happened, but is always happening.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:42.400]   And that's what I would say about the Exodus story.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.100]   It's not about whether, in fact, there was a killing of the firstborn.
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.260]   It's about does God deliver?
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.140]   Did God deliver the Jews in ancient times?
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.980]   Does God deliver people in modern times?
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:57.460]   And that's what the issue is.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:02.940]   And to me, the issue of faith is much deeper than the issue of fact.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:06.700]   I wouldn't look to the Torah for my science either.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:15.500]   What are the limits of science in terms of what can science not tell us that the Torah
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.460]   can in terms of wisdom?
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:22.260]   So the historicity, the facts of things, okay.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:28.180]   If the Torah is much more than that, is it, like you said, myth.
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:32.020]   Myth is not something that happened, but something that is always happening.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:39.700]   And so presumably, it's interacting with the environment of the day to generate wisdom.
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.080]   - So you can live a life by Torah.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:46.000]   I don't think you can live a life by biology.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.100]   You can live a life that is informed by the values of the tradition of Judaism.
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:24:01.520]   And those values, by the way, what science does is it contributes factuality to the conversation
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:04.740]   and also changes the reality around us.
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:11.180]   So when you study Talmud on your iPhone, you're still...
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:18.180]   I mean, it changes the atmosphere in which you do it, but the wisdom and the life guidance
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:24.400]   and the connection to transcendence is something that science doesn't give.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:30.660]   - So if we now step into, returning to our friend Sam Harris, and step into this weird
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:34.900]   place of science, and you talked about this, where the kind of the current assumption of
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:39.260]   science is it's a materialistic one.
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:44.380]   So for me, obviously, AI person, this whole mind thing is fascinating.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.020]   What the heck is going on up there?
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:49.940]   So how do you explain consciousness?
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:51.780]   How do you explain free will?
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:56.020]   Do you think, first of all, do you think we have a free will?
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:58.300]   And if so, what is it?
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:04.780]   - This is where we had the debate earlier that I mentioned with Hitchens, where I think
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:10.860]   actually neither he nor the moderator understood what I was saying, which is, I'm sure, my
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:12.340]   inability to express it.
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:17.340]   - But he was very focused and delivered on the humor and the wit.
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:25.540]   - Yes, but what I was trying to say is, if we're entirely biological creatures, if we
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:31.020]   didn't choose our genetics and we didn't choose our environment, then there is no space for
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:32.020]   free choice.
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:33.260]   I don't understand where it comes in.
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:37.100]   And I kept asking them that question, but didn't get an answer, 'cause I don't think
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.100]   there is an answer.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:43.520]   I think if you're a thoroughgoing materialist, free will is impossible.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.660]   There could be randomness, but randomness is not free will.
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:48.700]   It's randomness.
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:56.580]   I think you need a spiritual, non-material belief in order to get free will, and that's
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:57.900]   why I believe in free will.
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:02.380]   - Yeah, you were talking about, and actually the moderator totally missed your point, about
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:04.980]   the glass of water and basically what's the difference.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:10.660]   So do you, free will, 'cause you could also, if it fits into the materialistic picture,
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:13.900]   it could be just a convenient, useful quirk.
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:15.300]   - You would understand this better than I would.
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:19.700]   I don't understand how it could be a convenient quirk, materialistically.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.220]   I don't understand how to explain it.
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:27.460]   - Well, no, if you study perception, there's all these kinds of illusions.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:32.580]   Our mind plays tricks on us to make our life easier, more efficient, and survive better,
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:34.020]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:37.220]   And so the feeling like we have a choice-
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.220]   - Oh, that could be an illusion.
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:39.220]   - Could be an illusion.
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:40.580]   - Yeah, that I understand.
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:45.580]   But actual free choice, free will, I don't see where you get it if you're a materialist.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:49.060]   I think you have to have a spiritual component.
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:53.100]   By the way, I think Sam would agree with this.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:58.380]   I think he wrote about not having free will.
[01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:05.420]   And I think if you don't have a God, and you don't have a soul, that free will is a logical
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:06.420]   impossibility.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:13.740]   - For Sam, which is fascinating, it's not just that free will is an illusion, but the
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:19.780]   illusion of free will is an illusion, meaning we don't even experience anything like it.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:22.620]   There's no illusion.
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:25.300]   It's not even on us to be talking about it.
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:29.420]   We are like the current in the river or something.
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:30.740]   You were comparing it to the glass.
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:31.740]   We are just like that glass.
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:35.900]   So I don't know what we're going on about with this whole free will thing.
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:42.020]   I mean, to you, is the free will, the I that the young person is born with, is that somehow
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:44.900]   fundamental to religion?
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:46.340]   - It's fundamental to Judaism.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:55.180]   I think that the idea is that you are the custodian of your soul.
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:28:04.500]   And even though I grant that there's a certain overemphasis in modern society on the individuality
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:15.620]   of the soul, that is, we are more interconnected than I think we believe, still, yeah, the
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:21.180]   I, the idea that every human being is an image of God, that the human being in the Torah
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:22.980]   is created singly.
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:26.820]   And again, do I really believe there was an Adam and an Eve in a Garden of Eden?
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:33.380]   No, not literally, but I think that it expresses a deep truth about human life.
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:37.660]   - And tied into this is the subjective experience of things, which we call consciousness.
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:45.940]   - I mean, this is the most fascinating and inexplicable discussion.
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:50.940]   And again, this is a discussion I've had, I privileged to have with Daniel Dennett and
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:58.100]   could not make any, as you can imagine, any headway on my, but he was delightful and brilliant
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:01.660]   to talk to.
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:05.860]   For me, consciousness is a real thing.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:12.460]   I don't know if it is, I mean, I kind of like the panpsychist's view that there's an element
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:19.540]   of consciousness in everything, that that's constitutive of reality, but I'm not wedded
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:20.540]   to it.
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:26.460]   But I think that it exists in different degrees in all sentient creatures.
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:31.740]   I think that anybody who has a pet knows that they have some kind of consciousness.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:32.740]   - Except cats.
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:37.940]   - Except cats, I'm not gonna, since I don't have cats or dogs, I'm not going to.
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:39.980]   - Another reason people would be outraged, I said it.
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:44.220]   - Well, I happen to be allergic to both, but I'm very fond of animals.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:52.860]   The thing that so perplexes me about this is the denial of the reality of consciousness
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:57.420]   from people who are fully aware that they're conscious.
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:02.860]   I don't know how you divest yourself of the most present quality of being a person in
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:07.460]   your discussions about what it is to be a person.
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:12.060]   - We just don't really have a good sense of the alternative, and so you can kind of divest
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.060]   yourself in that way.
[01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:20.940]   Well, maybe everything is like this, maybe we're over-dramatizing this whole thing.
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:26.860]   It seems like every living thing, perhaps everything, period, thinks that it's the center
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:27.860]   of the universe.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:28.860]   - Right.
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:32.180]   - And so here we are telling ourselves these dramatic big stories about us being special
[01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:37.980]   and so on, and maybe we need to have a little bit more humility, both about the uncertainty
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:39.980]   and about our place in the whole.
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:44.620]   - Any statement you make about something like consciousness has, I think, a sort of equal
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:46.580]   level of humility.
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:51.740]   You are saying that you know we don't have it is as, not you, Lex, but you, person saying
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:55.380]   we don't have it, is as intellectually arrogant as my saying we do.
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:31:03.300]   So I think for me, humility comes in in admitting that we really, really have just the tiniest
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:06.900]   part of the puzzle.
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:11.620]   And as you get older, at least my experience has been not that you get more answers, but
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:14.180]   that you just see a bigger puzzle.
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:19.700]   - So to me, there is less, so the questions are fascinating, but there's also an engineering
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.340]   practical question.
[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:29.380]   And perhaps I'll ask you a religious one too on this point, to return back to robots.
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:35.340]   So how to engineer consciousness, or I'll just even ask you a very simple question,
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:44.940]   which is when you have robots that exhibit the capacity to suffer, I found in myself
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:49.480]   as a human, when I see that, I feel something.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:54.620]   Exhibit the capacity to suffer, or they exhibit behaviors that evoke in you a sense that they
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:55.620]   are suffering?
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:58.420]   Those aren't the same things.
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:01.860]   - From an observation perspective, they sure as heck seem similar.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:03.400]   - You think they're feeling pain?
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:08.180]   - I don't know what the, I'm observing pain.
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.180]   - Okay.
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:14.980]   - It's like when I watch a movie and there's people on screen, some of them are dressed
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:18.140]   like Batman.
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:23.540]   But you can make the distinction, like if I have a doll and I bend the doll over and
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:30.300]   it makes a sad face, I know that that doll is not actually in pain, even though I am
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:31.680]   observing pain.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:33.660]   So the question, what's that?
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:42.220]   - The question is when the doll becomes able to remember things about you, David, about
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:51.020]   the experiences you shared, it is able to speak and make you feel like there's an actual
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:52.020]   relationship there.
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:57.900]   - So that's what I'm asking, is at what point do you believe that the, and I know that this
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:01.340]   is an impossible question, but at what point do you believe that there is a consciousness
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:09.340]   in there as opposed to just an extraordinary, I mean like when I play chess against a computer
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:16.860]   and it beats me, I'm embarrassed even though the computer doesn't, I don't think the computer
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:20.660]   is going, "Ah, you idiot," but it feels that way.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:24.860]   But there is some part of me that says, "Okay, I know that this computer doesn't actually
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:28.980]   know who I am or care who I am, it just knows how to move the pieces."
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:34.220]   So at what point do you, I mean, you're giving me instances, it speaks, it does this, it
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:38.500]   does this, but at what point does that for you cross the threshold into it's actually
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:39.780]   a sentient being?
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:43.340]   - I think the question is whether there is a threshold that could be crossed.
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.340]   That's one question.
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:48.260]   And I can answer this because I think it's different from person to person, but the chess
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:54.900]   engine is not at all trying to cross that threshold.
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:56.700]   Let's just start there.
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:34:06.020]   And to me, the personalization, which is what's the difference, like a friend that you meet,
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:11.980]   you've shared all these memories, and the way they look at you will convey, and the
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:17.220]   things they say will convey that they've shared those memories with you.
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:22.580]   They'll be able to speak in a shared humor and the language, but really the memories
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:25.940]   is the big one of having gone through things together.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:33.900]   I think I would have more and more trouble, for example, turning off a system that I've
[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:37.500]   been through things with.
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:40.860]   And by turning off, I mean delete all of its memory.
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:46.940]   If me and the toaster have gone through a bunch of dramatic events and that toaster
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:52.700]   remembers, there's a certain level to where it's just me and the toaster and this together
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:54.180]   at this point.
[01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:58.260]   And just to talk about sentience, I don't know, but you know.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:34:59.260]   - I don't know.
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:03.380]   It's according to the scripture, can't live by bread alone.
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:09.660]   But I would, I mean, I know that there's no way to determine this, but it's still about
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.260]   what you feel.
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:12.260]   - Yes.
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:15.220]   But isn't that what human relations are also though?
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:18.100]   - Yes, but- - We make each other feel.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:23.180]   - But it's true that I have the assumption that you feel somewhat like I do.
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:28.100]   I mean, obviously I don't, and that could be illusion and I don't know.
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:31.500]   And I know that you don't feel exactly as I do.
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:39.540]   But I think we have a long, at least to me, we have a long way to go before the detached
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:44.740]   part of our brains, that is the objective evaluating part as opposed to the emotive
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:49.860]   it feels this way part, believe that that machine has consciousness.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:54.500]   - I think it's at least, without arriving at conclusions, it's at least possible that
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:36:03.100]   one day we'll look back and realize that we have yet once again formed another tribe and
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:11.100]   that scripture all along had in it the ability for humans and robots to have a deep, meaningful
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:17.340]   connection and that through the robot, the life that enters the body of another robot,
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:21.100]   what's the difference between a biological body and a mechanical one?
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:27.060]   And then we will see that the fundamental thing is about the, whatever you wanna call
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:34.620]   it, sentience, whatever can permeate an object, that was the thing all along.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:38.700]   - So I mean- - And then you'll get canceled one more time
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:40.060]   because you will- - I'll get canceled again 'cause I denied
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.060]   it.
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:42.060]   I was gonna say- - You'll eventually, I will eventually
[01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:43.060]   convince you.
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:45.500]   - Oh, I see, 'cause I'll preach to the robots.
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.500]   - I'm hoping.
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.500]   I'm hoping.
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:55.380]   - First of all, depends how quickly you do it and how much longer I have to live.
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:37:04.860]   I resisted tremendously, but I am also enough of a student of history to know that my instinctive
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:11.060]   resistance has nothing to do with whether it will come about.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.460]   I have a hard time believing it.
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:14.460]   We'll see.
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:18.260]   - Can I ask you about this?
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:19.260]   Maybe you can educate me.
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:24.020]   I tend to believe that, you mentioned suffering, that there is a connection between consciousness
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:30.320]   and suffering, that suffering is a fundamental part, the capacity to suffer is the fundamental
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.700]   part of being human.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:34.820]   - I mean, look, when you're not conscious, you don't suffer.
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:38.540]   We've had operations where we've been put under anesthetic, we're not conscious, and
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:39.940]   we don't suffer during the operation.
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:43.600]   If we were conscious, we would.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:48.860]   But there's also, I mean, there's a non-physical suffering that is very much tied to consciousness.
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:55.820]   I can think of things right now that will cause me suffering, like pain that I've caused
[01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:59.740]   or pain that other people I care about have felt or so on.
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:05.940]   So I don't see how, I think it's equally true of joy.
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:09.140]   Joy is also a product of consciousness.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:14.760]   - All tied in in some beautiful, messy way with memory and so on, that we can re-experience
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:17.840]   it when we recall the memories.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.480]   But why is there suffering?
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:20.480]   You mentioned evil.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:21.560]   Why is there evil in the world?
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:24.720]   You can tell stories about this.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.720]   Why is there suffering?
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.920]   Why is there evil in the world if there's a God that cares for us?
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:35.940]   - So let's assume for a minute that everything was a primitive robot.
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:41.200]   There would be no suffering, but there would also be no growth.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:44.800]   And that implies choices.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:51.520]   One of the things that I've said that I know why it hurts people, and I don't mean it quite
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:59.880]   the way that, but I will say it nonetheless, is the Holocaust presents the exact same theological
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:06.160]   question as somebody who gets shot on the streets of a city in Los Angeles, which is,
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.660]   "God, why do you allow some people to do bad things to other people?"
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:14.120]   It's on an unimaginable scale, but it's the same question.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:18.540]   And the answer has to be, you either allow people to have free will or you don't.
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:24.240]   You can't say as God, "I'm gonna let everybody have free will, but not Nazis."
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.680]   Nazis don't get free will.
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:29.480]   Because Cambodians, they can kill each other.
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:33.440]   Rwandans kill each other, but the Nazis don't get to do that.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:39.160]   So that's one piece of the puzzle.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.760]   And what makes it unfathomable is when you're actually faced with suffering, these kinds
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.460]   of explanations are obscene.
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:46.460]   They just are.
[01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:47.460]   You can't...
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:51.280]   I mean, when somebody is actually suffering, "Oh, the rabbi said God gave people free will,"
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:53.280]   that's just awful.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:59.520]   But there is a second piece to this also, which is that there is natural suffering,
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:06.480]   like children born with diseases or earthquakes or volcanoes or whatever.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:11.280]   And here my argument is that in some ways, suffering has to be random in the world.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:15.280]   Because when people say, "Why do bad things happen to good people?"
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.080]   Well, if only good things happen to good people, everybody would be good.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.160]   But it would have no moral content.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:25.760]   The only way you can be good and it have moral content is say, "I know that I can live a
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:30.280]   really good life and have really terrible things happen to me nonetheless."
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:34.240]   So it feels to me like it has to be a randomly.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:40.460]   Now that means, by the way, that I've been incredibly lucky.
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:43.080]   I don't have a good life because I was good.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.920]   I have a good life because I was lucky.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:50.720]   And that implies not that I should feel guilty about it, but that I have a tremendous responsibility
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.040]   as a result to other people who aren't so lucky.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:58.280]   Tremendous responsibility to study the lessons of history, to tell the stories of those who
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:05.040]   are less lucky, and to draw enough wisdom from them so that we have less cruelty and
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:09.760]   suffering in the world, or have new kinds that get us to improve even more.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.960]   That's right, exactly.
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.760]   That we suffer better.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.200]   Suffer better.
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:22.000]   For a lot of people, mortality is one of the very unfortunate versions of suffering, which
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:27.840]   is that the ride ends in this realm, whatever it is.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.120]   What do you think of mortality?
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.320]   Is it something you think about?
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:34.040]   Is it something you fear?
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.400]   What do you think happens after we die?
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.560]   I don't fear it.
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:45.660]   First of all, I would say when I was in high school, I think my father actually encouraged
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:47.120]   me to read this book.
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:52.440]   I read Ernest Becker's Denial of Death, which I found, and still find, to be one of the
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:56.360]   most profound works I've ever come across.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:04.880]   And he convinced me that a lot of what our society is about are ways that we avoid encountering
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.480]   our own mortality.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.000]   Our physicality, I mean, among the points he makes, and I'm not quoting him at all
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.900]   directly, is like, "Why does everything about our physical body make us so uncomfortable?
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:20.640]   Everything that comes out of you, other than tears, is either mildly or very disgusting.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:21.640]   Why?
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:23.140]   Why does that have to be?
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:28.480]   Why are sex and eating and all the things that are physical surrounded with so much
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.480]   symbolism?"
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.840]   I mean, what are table manners, really?
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:35.200]   They're like, "We're not eating like animals because we're not eating like animals."
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.460]   And sex, obviously, has more symbolism around it than anything.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:42.180]   And his answer is, "Anything that reminds you that you're a physical body, because that's
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:43.180]   what dies.
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:44.180]   Your body dies.
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:45.180]   It decays.
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:46.180]   It dies.
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.180]   It gets eaten by worms.
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:50.020]   That you don't want to think about, so you deny it."
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:56.520]   I think that part of religion is a confrontation with your own mortality, but also a certain
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:01.360]   transcendence of it, because the idea is something about you is eternal.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.360]   What exactly?
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.480]   I don't know.
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:07.040]   And you asked, "What do I think happens after we die?"
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:14.960]   So I don't know any better than anyone else does, but I'll say two things about it.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:21.680]   One is that every image of what it's like is foolish.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:24.980]   Mark Twain has, I think in Letters from Earth, he says, "We're going to lie on green fields
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:28.700]   and listen to harp music," which you wouldn't want to do for five minutes while you're alive,
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:32.280]   but you think you'll be happy for the rest of eternity doing it after you die.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:33.280]   So I don't know.
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.380]   This world was a surprise.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:36.200]   So why shouldn't the next world be a surprise?
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:37.920]   I have no idea.
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:45.200]   But I really like this parable that's told by a guy in a book on death and mourning,
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:49.120]   by a rabbi in a book on death and mourning about twins in a womb.
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:54.840]   He says, "One of them believes that there's a life outside and the other one doesn't."
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:58.680]   He says, "The one who doesn't says, 'Look, this is the only world we've ever seen, the
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:43:59.680]   only world we've ever known.
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.400]   Why do you think there's something out there?'"
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:05.700]   He says, "Now imagine the one who believes is born."
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:09.820]   Back in the womb, his brother is mourning a death, but outside, everybody's celebrating
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:10.820]   a birth.
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:13.200]   He said, "And that's what it's like when you die."
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:14.460]   And I love that image.
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:16.620]   - Yeah, the grass is always greener.
[01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:18.140]   It's the new step.
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.780]   But the eternity thing is an interesting one.
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:27.020]   It's yet another concept that I feel humans are fully inequipped to comprehend.
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:30.500]   Is eternity fundamental somehow to all of these discussions?
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:35.660]   - I think it is, well, partly because God is supposed to be eternal, and therefore,
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:41.540]   it moves the mind in that direction, even though it is completely unfathomable.
[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:46.860]   - 'Cause sometimes I would say eternity, you said on a green field, sometimes a moment,
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:52.860]   like a truly joyful moment, feels like an eternity, the intensity of it.
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:58.420]   Maybe eternity is more about stopping time versus extending time indefinitely.
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:03.300]   That's something that we just totally can't comprehend, us silly humans.
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:09.820]   - All I would say is the older you get, the more you're struck by the fact that time does
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:13.380]   not freeze.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:16.980]   People will sometimes say to me, "You haven't aged a day."
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:22.340]   And then I'll look at an old picture of myself, and I'll say, "That was very kind of you."
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:23.340]   But that's not true.
[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:25.660]   It's not true.
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:31.180]   So yeah, I mean, I love the idea of seeing eternity in a grain of sand, was how Blake
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:32.180]   put it.
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:33.180]   I love that notion.
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:40.140]   But when you talk about life after death, I think that in some ways, my fundamental
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:47.020]   faith is in human beings, that this doesn't all disappear, that there's something about
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:51.220]   people that transcends this world.
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:54.540]   - You mentioned Ernest Becker in high school, and the Battle of Death.
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:46:00.740]   Maybe you can mention if you still see truth and wisdom in some of this idea.
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:06.460]   But in general, can you go all the way back and tell some of the fascinating story of
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.900]   how you found faith?
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:14.700]   - When I was in high school, I was a really pretty ardent atheist.
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:20.700]   And I loved Bertrand Russell, who was, for my money, with all due respect to all the
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:26.340]   very, very capable people that we've talked about earlier, he's the best atheist pound
[01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:32.260]   for pound that there was, and a remarkably witty and lucid writer.
[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:34.060]   And I was totally in his thrall.
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:37.960]   And I would read every book by Russell I could get my hands on.
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:47.100]   And the reason that I did, I have this theory that why do adolescent boys like Mr. Spock
[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:51.100]   and like Sherlock Holmes?
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:55.900]   I think it's because when you hit puberty, for a lot of us, there's so much discomfort
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:59.220]   with our bodies that we like the idea that we're just brains.
[01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:00.820]   I really think so.
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:02.220]   I had that experience.
[01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:05.260]   It's like, I want to just be a thinking machine.
[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:08.100]   I don't want to be a body, because my body was making me so uncomfortable.
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:12.400]   I had all these urges and inclinations that I couldn't control.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.580]   So Russell was perfect.
[01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:20.780]   And my father, who was a rabbi, did the very wise thing of buying me some of Bertrand Russell's
[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:25.340]   books, which was his way of saying, "I'm not afraid of him."
[01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:27.380]   And actually, there was another rabbi.
[01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:30.860]   I was at summer camp, and I was sitting on the porch of the...
[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:35.140]   I remember exactly, and I was reading Bertrand Russell, and this guy came up to me and said,
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.140]   "What are you reading?"
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:38.660]   I was maybe 16 or 17, and I said, "Bertrand Russell."
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:40.780]   I was spoiling for a fight.
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:42.620]   And he said, "I'm glad you're reading him."
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:43.620]   I said, "Really?
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:44.860]   Because how old are you, David?"
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:47.620]   I said, "Whatever I was, 16, 17."
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:53.140]   He said, "Well, I'd rather you grow out of him than grow into him."
[01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:54.140]   And you know what?
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:48:01.220]   He was actually right, because when I started to read about Russell's life, I realized that
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:04.660]   all of that rationality didn't shield him.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:11.260]   He had an incredibly messy life, multiple marriages, endless infidelities, family members
[01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:12.900]   he didn't speak to, didn't speak to him.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:18.260]   His father was raised by his grandparents, because his parents had died, and really not
[01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:19.820]   a happy or...
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:23.380]   I mean, a remarkable life, but not a happy one.
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:29.100]   And so I started to believe that maybe it was possible that people who had faith were
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:38.340]   not just stupid and needed crutches, but saw something deeper than Russell did.
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:43.460]   And the more people that I met that were like that...
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:46.500]   It's funny, because I always thought, "Okay, my father is a rabbi, that's great, but nobody
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:49.260]   else."
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:54.380]   And I think what happened to me was it was not a logical decision to come to faith.
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:56.020]   It was a sort of opening of my heart.
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:49:02.060]   It's like, "This world is way much more than my mind can capture."
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:04.460]   And I kind of felt my way to God.
[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:08.020]   And in the moments, my faith...
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:12.660]   There was a rabbi named Rabbi Nachman of Bratislava, he said he was a moon man, his faith waxed
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:13.820]   and waned.
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:16.700]   So sometimes I have more, sometimes less.
[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:20.940]   But in my feeling-er moments is when I have more.
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:29.580]   So with your heart open, what would you say in your feeling-er moments is the most beautiful
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:33.980]   part about Judaism, in your faith?
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:41.540]   I think the most beautiful part about Judaism is that even though it is filled with humor
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:47.180]   and wit, it takes life and it takes the soul seriously.
[01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:53.220]   It really believes that this matters, and that we matter, and what we do matters.
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:55.820]   And I think that that's incredibly important.
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:50:01.660]   And especially in a world in which young people feel so much like they don't matter, that's
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:05.180]   an unbelievably powerful message.
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:17.140]   I mean, I wanna say almost to every young woman under 30 on TikTok, you don't matter
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:18.540]   because you're beautiful.
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:19.860]   That's not why you matter.
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:21.420]   I hope you know that.
[01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:23.860]   You matter 'cause you have a soul.
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:28.060]   And to every young man who's like nihilistic and doesn't think, and just thinks that if
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:31.300]   they make enough money, their life will be fine, I wanna say the same thing.
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:33.260]   Which is really, that's not...
[01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:38.100]   Ultimately, you matter because you're in the image of God.
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:42.020]   And Judaism really deeply, deeply believes and preaches that.
[01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:48.380]   And I think that that's a message that has so much to say to the world.
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:51.820]   It's like you have to take people's souls seriously.
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:56.300]   And for all of the difficulty in figuring out all these social questions and what they
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:51:03.060]   mean, I just don't wanna dismiss people because I disagree with them politically or socially
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:07.060]   or culturally, 'cause I think they matter.
[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:16.700]   So ultimately, Judaism has a wealth of meaning for human mind.
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:18.380]   I really believe that it does.
[01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.060]   I really do.
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:27.380]   And its meaning, and I wanna emphasize this, is not political.
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:30.300]   The deepest meaning of Judaism is not political.
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:33.860]   Well, there's, we put politics on top of everything.
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:34.860]   Exactly.
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:36.180]   But that's why I wanna emphasize it.
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:38.380]   The deepest meaning is on a soul level.
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:40.300]   It's not on a voting level.
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:44.260]   Well, that combined with the humor, it's clear to me that Christopher Hitchens should have
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.260]   been a Jew.
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.260]   He was.
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:47.320]   He actually was.
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:50.940]   He discovered that in his 30s, that his mother was Jewish.
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:51.940]   That's fascinating.
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:52.940]   Yup.
[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:55.500]   He actually, he has a beautiful essay about it, "Discovering in His 30s That His Mother
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:56.500]   Was Jewish."
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:57.500]   Yup.
[01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:03.100]   So remarkably enough, he actually was Jewish.
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:06.380]   His autobiography, Hitch 22, is a great read.
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:10.760]   And I just wanna say, what you discover there, I don't know if I'm giving too much away by
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:11.760]   telling the story of his life.
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:12.760]   Spoiler alert.
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:17.320]   What you discover there is that his mother ran away with a minister or a priest and they
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:20.260]   died in what seemed like was a suicide pact.
[01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:25.380]   And so I read it, unfortunately, after he passed away, but I would have wanted to ask
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:30.460]   him, do you think that has anything to do maybe with the hostility towards religion?
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:31.740]   We are only human.
[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:35.580]   My father, I mean, both my parents, but my father who was a rabbi was such a wonderful,
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:36.960]   warm, and loving man.
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:42.340]   So I associate a religious figure with real goodness.
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:49.340]   And I'm sorry to return to a darker topic, but I really wanted to ask you this for the
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:52.260]   current events, for a recent event.
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:54.660]   I mentioned Dallas.
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:59.260]   What lessons do you draw from the Dallas Synagogue hostage incident?
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:03.540]   Well, the week after that, we had active shooter training in my synagogues.
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:09.100]   And one of the things I drew was that security for synagogues is important.
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:17.660]   And the second is that the reality of antisemitism, which I had thought had waned when I first
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:21.500]   began my rabbinate, I thought it's not going to be such a big issue.
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.660]   It is like an evergreen issue.
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:30.100]   And Jews and all people of goodwill have to take this really seriously because it has
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:31.700]   devastating consequences.
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:35.360]   And if the world doesn't know that, then it just hasn't been paying attention.
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:41.420]   So there's antisemitism at a scale of human to human, but there's also, like you mentioned,
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:48.780]   politics get mixed up into things, nations get mixed into things, impossible to answer.
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:56.940]   But I have to ask, what do you think about the long running saga of Israel and Palestine?
[01:53:56.940 --> 01:54:00.220]   Will we ever see peace in that part of the Middle East?
[01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:03.620]   Well, since I'm an optimist about human...
[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:07.380]   Look, I mean, I have many, many thoughts about it.
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:11.780]   I'm a very, very strong supporter of Israel.
[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:16.340]   And I also feel really for the plight of the Palestinians.
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:26.480]   I think that this is a clash of legitimate narratives that is impossible to exactly split
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:29.140]   the difference of.
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:36.580]   However, I know that Israel has made peace with Egypt, has made peace with Jordan, has
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:39.900]   made peace now with other Arab nations.
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:44.160]   I don't believe that Israel is unwilling to make peace.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:51.220]   And so I think that as difficult as it will be for the Palestinians to come to grips with
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:56.300]   the fact that the Jewish state is not leaving and is legitimately here, as opposed to, "We
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:55:00.260]   can't get rid of it now, but we will get rid of it one day."
[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:06.820]   If that comes to be, and I believe that it will, I think not only that there would be
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:10.620]   peace, but I think that those two peoples together could probably do remarkable things
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:12.140]   in the world.
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:16.120]   Do you think the source of it is politics?
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:19.460]   Is it religious ideas?
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:23.540]   And to flip it, what is the way out?
[01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:26.220]   Is it geopolitics?
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:32.700]   Is it interfaith discourse and collaboration?
[01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:37.580]   Or is it simply the human love?
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:41.980]   So I think that I'm not sure that I could give one answer to that, but I will give a
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:43.960]   piece of an answer.
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:46.700]   Why did the Abraham Accords happen?
[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:52.840]   The main reason that they happened was because economics overrode ideology.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:58.060]   And I actually am hopeful that that's in the end what will happen, that people will say,
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:55:59.060]   "You know what?
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:07.560]   We could have such a better life if we put aside the ideological animosities and just
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:11.500]   created this different kind of Middle East together."
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:18.200]   I went to Dubai to watch the World Chess Championship because I really wanted to see Magnus Carlsen
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:19.200]   play.
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:23.440]   He's still alive when you have such a remarkable world champion go see him play.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:28.880]   So I actually took myself to Dubai for the last couple of games and I watched.
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:30.640]   And so I wasn't so much...
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:34.480]   I mean, it's not that I'm uninterested in Dubai, but I went there for the chess thing.
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:38.000]   The Expo was also on at the same time and I saw, "Here's this amazing place."
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.200]   I came back.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.200]   This guy I know who lived in Dubai for several years and works in the Middle East said to
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:43.200]   me, "What did you think of it?"
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:45.200]   And I said, "It's nice.
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:46.200]   It's Dubai."
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:53.200]   And he said, "It's very polished, very sophisticated, very clean, no crime and so on, but it was
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:56.240]   like Las Vegas in the Middle East without the gambling or something like that."
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:57.240]   He said, "You know..."
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:00.920]   And he totally changed my perspective in a couple of sentences.
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:04.120]   He said, "I know it seems like that when you come from Los Angeles."
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:10.080]   He said, "But fly there from Yemen or from Riyadh and it is a miracle."
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.200]   And I thought, "Oh my God, you're right."
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:19.120]   It's like what human beings can do if they just put aside their ideological shackles
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.880]   is remarkable.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:23.680]   And I'm hopeful that one day that'll happen.
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:26.240]   - Economics allows for a higher quality of life.
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.240]   You no longer...
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:30.560]   It's the playground analogy you said earlier.
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:38.280]   If there's more resources to play with, unfortunately us humans are more willing to play with others.
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:39.560]   And maybe that is the solution.
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:48.040]   Maybe, I mean, for me from a technology perspective, innovation, engineering helps make everybody's
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:49.760]   life better.
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:56.840]   And over that, once people's lives become better, they start to have more time to be
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:58.400]   empathetic and hear people out.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.520]   - And they have more to lose.
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:03.000]   When you have more to lose, it actually makes you...
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.840]   I think countries are less willing to go to war when they have more to lose.
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:12.200]   And families want peace when it's good at home.
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:14.920]   So I think there's an element of that as well.
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:19.120]   - And some of it, again, taking us back to the other aspect of our conversation is how
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:23.120]   we're conducting ourselves in conversation online and so on.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:30.320]   'Cause I think actually I'm a big fan of the idea of social media that is a way for us
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.440]   to connect together.
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:36.800]   I think there's a lot of really strong ideas how to do that well.
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:44.260]   And clearly the initial attempts that kind of just open it up wide, some of the lesser
[01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:50.140]   aspects of human nature can take over when combined with different forces like advertisements
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:52.360]   and virality and all those kinds of things.
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:58.560]   But overall, I love the honesty of the mess of it being presented before us on social
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:58:59.560]   media.
[01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:03.840]   It's part of me, maybe because I don't participate it.
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:10.000]   Like if somebody is being mean to me or being aggressive and these kinds of things, I enjoy
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.400]   it because it's human nature.
[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:15.040]   But I enjoy it because I don't respond.
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:19.560]   I think if I responded, I would get pulled into this human nature and then it's not fun.
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:21.120]   But I love the...
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:22.600]   I'll talk to people.
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:24.400]   In fact, I still visit Clubhouse.
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:25.920]   I don't know if you know what that is.
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:26.920]   - Sure.
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:27.920]   - Oh, right.
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:28.920]   That's right.
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:29.920]   Actually when I...
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:30.920]   - I think that's how we first met.
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:31.920]   - Well, yeah.
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:32.920]   Well, I was such a fan boy.
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:37.200]   I was like, "I can't believe I get to talk to David Welby."
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:47.560]   But the Israel-Palestine topic was something that was very deeply in a heated way discussed
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:48.560]   on Clubhouse.
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:52.360]   Race relations is a thing that was really heatedly discussed.
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:55.440]   And I now go to Clubhouse to practice Russian.
[01:59:55.440 --> 02:00:03.400]   And there in Russian, the heated discussion is on basically any topic as meaningless or
[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:06.760]   meaningful as you want and the heat of it.
[02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:12.360]   Just people just screaming and then calming down and going through the full process.
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:15.080]   That too is beautiful because that emotion is there.
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:21.700]   And if it is allowed to have a voice, I think ultimately it leads to healing.
[02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:23.200]   So that felt really healthy.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:26.680]   If you learn how to do that at scale.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:32.040]   - Social media, I wish that it were not as algorithmically biased towards conflict.
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:35.360]   I don't think that that's healthy, but I do...
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:41.480]   I think it brings a lot of blessings into people's lives if they use it wisely.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:47.160]   Like anything else, it can be awful, but it can...
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:51.000]   I've connected to all sorts of people that I never would have known.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.320]   And that's been wonderful.
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:53.320]   So...
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:57.440]   - Let me ask you the big question of advice.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:04.240]   What advice would you give to young people today that are maybe high school, college,
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:08.080]   thinking about career, thinking about life, that can be proud of?
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:13.200]   - So the first thing that I would say is that life is longer than you think it is.
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:22.080]   Even though I understand the impulse to be in a rush, you will have many unfoldings.
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.360]   Or even the people of my generation did.
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:26.280]   - Unfoldings, that's such a funny word.
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.280]   It's a beautiful word.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:28.280]   - I'd suggest...
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.280]   - Unfolding.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:30.280]   - But it feels that way.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:33.520]   It's like different aspects of your life will come...
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:40.640]   Will show you different possibilities that you don't imagine at the moment.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:46.680]   And I think the second thing that I would say is...
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:52.520]   I know that this is a very old-fashioned, but I would say don't...
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:55.800]   To the extent that you can read, don't just...
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:58.960]   And not just on social media, read books.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:05.480]   Learn things that will give you a broader context for your life than just today or yesterday
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:09.720]   or the day before.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:22.560]   And I suppose the other thing that I would say is that to the extent that you can try
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:29.760]   to develop your own internal metric of both what matters and what is good, because you
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:36.440]   will be exposed to more voices than any generation in history telling you that that's good or
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:37.440]   this is good.
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:41.960]   They're not called influencers, but what they are is voices telling you what you should
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:44.040]   think and what you should believe.
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:51.280]   And so have some internal space where you'll be able to say, for example, "I know this
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:54.800]   person is doing that and it looks great, but that's not me."
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:02.320]   - You have a community of people that speak to you with a lot of passion.
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:09.000]   Do you still have that voice in your own, in the privacy of your own mind that you're
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:15.880]   able to ignore, like for a moment, just be with yourself and think what is right?
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:16.880]   - Absolutely.
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:19.200]   And I think it's partly because I grew up without that.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:24.400]   I mean, I grew up with a lot of space in my life, and so I had a chance to develop that
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:25.400]   voice.
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:28.360]   That's why I think it's harder for kids today than it was for me.
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.400]   I mean, I grew up when there were three channels.
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:31.600]   There was three, six, and 10.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:35.120]   There was ABC, CBS, and NBC, and that was it.
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:38.800]   And you spent your evening playing board games or reading or whatever, and there was a lot
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:40.200]   of space.
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:43.800]   And we played football on the street, and you went on your bike in the morning, and
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:49.160]   nobody worried about you, and you came home at night and everybody assumed you were fine.
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:57.320]   And also, I went into a religious tradition where I feel like I have the opportunity to
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:01.140]   judge myself by bigger metrics.
[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:02.140]   And it's still hard.
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:06.860]   I don't want to, it's not like, oh, it's, I wear impenetrable armor.
[02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:07.860]   It's still hard.
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:13.880]   So how much harder for kids today when they don't have that?
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:15.600]   - You mentioned books.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:20.200]   Is there Bertrand Russell and Denial of Death by Ernest Becker?
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:25.200]   Is there books that pop into mind that had an impact on you?
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:27.640]   - My favorite novel is Middlemarch.
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:28.640]   - Middlemarch?
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:29.640]   - Middlemarch.
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:34.040]   I remember, I was listening to a podcast, I was listening to one of your podcasts where
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:41.880]   your guest said the two greatest novels of the 19th century were Brothers Karamazov and
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:43.000]   what was the other one he mentioned?
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000]   I don't remember.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000]   - Dostoevsky as well or no?
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000]   - I think.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000]   - Was it both Dostoevsky?
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000]   - It might have been.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.000]   I don't remember.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.880]   Maybe the, but anyway, but I would say Middlemarch is up there.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:57.720]   Middlemarch presents an entire world, and it's written by a woman, Mary Ann Evans, who
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:04.480]   took the pen name George Eliot, who you feel, Virginia Woolf said it's the only English
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:07.340]   novel written for grownups.
[02:05:07.340 --> 02:05:12.000]   You feel the genius in her sentences, like the pressure of her intellect in her sentences.
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.280]   It's a beautiful, it's a wonderful, wonderful book.
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:15.280]   I love it.
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.760]   - Pressure of her intellect.
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:20.040]   - Yeah, you really do.
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:26.720]   I also love, I love Saul Bellow, especially Herzog, but it's a very different kind of
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:27.840]   thinking person's novel.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:34.520]   I read a lot of mysteries and a lot of other kinds of fiction and literature, but in terms
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:40.920]   of the books that most, you mentioned one of them, which is Viktor Frankl's Man's Search
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:46.040]   for Meaning, and I also really, really love Heschel's The Sabbath.
[02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:48.480]   I think it's a beautiful book.
[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:51.720]   It's a very short book, just as Frankl's book is.
[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:54.880]   - What do you take from Man's Search for Meaning?
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:06:05.120]   What do you take of a human being in the worst conditions being able to non-dramatically
[02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:10.400]   find little joys, find beauty?
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:15.280]   - It's what I said before about Judaism's advice to younger people, is that it mattered.
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:20.320]   If you believe that something matters, you have enormous resilience.
[02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:24.400]   It's meaninglessness that is the greatest threat to a decent life.
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:30.240]   When people are deeply depressed, whether it is chemical depression or what they feel
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:35.400]   like is this is all meaningless, and meaning...
[02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:44.640]   Now obviously chemical depression calls in part for chemical means, but meaning is the
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:47.700]   great antidote.
[02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:49.120]   We can talk about what kind of meaning.
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:55.480]   There are kinds of meanings that are awful, but meaning is the great antidote to a sense
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:07:03.920]   that life is just nihilistic and purposeless and to that destructiveness that I think is
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:04.920]   too common.
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:12.800]   - Yeah, so maybe the heroic action in Nazi Germany, in the Holocaust, in the camps is
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:18.240]   the even not the action, but just the realization that every life matters.
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:25.280]   So here's this really wonderful story that Hugo Grin, who was a rabbi in England, died,
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:27.920]   I don't know, like 15, 20 years ago, used to tell.
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:29.480]   He grew up in Auschwitz.
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:34.320]   He was a child there and he was with his father and it was Hanukkah and you're supposed to
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:35.440]   light the candles.
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:39.840]   And his father took the margarine ration and used it as the oil to light the Hanukkah candles.
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:43.540]   And Hugo was scandalized and he said, "That's our food."
[02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:49.140]   And his father said, "What we have learned, my son, is you can live for three weeks without
[02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:50.140]   food.
[02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:54.140]   You can live for three days without water, but you can't live for three minutes without
[02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:55.140]   hope."
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:08:04.060]   - Well, hope, let me ask you, you said meaning.
[02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:06.060]   What's the meaning of this whole thing?
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:07.620]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:10.620]   You're the perfect person to ask this question.
[02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:11.620]   - Rabbi David Wolfe.
[02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:16.160]   - I believe the meaning of life is for human beings to grow in soul.
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:17.160]   That's why we're here.
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:21.300]   And you can do that in infinite numbers of ways, but you're supposed to return your soul
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:25.020]   like more burnished and beautiful, then you got it.
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:32.740]   I mean, it's gonna have some nicks and cuts, but that's what it means to deepen and grow
[02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:33.740]   it.
[02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:38.280]   And you do that more than anything else.
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:40.100]   You do that by learning how to love.
[02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:43.140]   I mean, that's the principle way I think that you do it.
[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:49.140]   - You know, it's interesting 'cause for a human, the relationship, if you're a man of
[02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:58.220]   faith is with God, but it feels like love is so richly part of human society that it's
[02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:01.460]   not just love of God, it's love of each other.
[02:09:01.460 --> 02:09:02.460]   - Right, yep.
[02:09:02.460 --> 02:09:03.980]   There's no question about the idea.
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:10.000]   I mean, in Judaism, that was actually the great innovation of the monotheistic idea.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.740]   In pagan societies, it was all about how you treated the gods.
[02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:17.340]   Monotheism said, no, God cares how you treat each other.
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:25.900]   So it's, in fact, the mystics use the same kind of word in Hebrew, d'vaikut, which means
[02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:30.100]   clinging, that is used about Adam and Eve.
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:35.300]   It says, "Therefore a man will leave his father and mother and davach with his wife."
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:36.580]   And davach means cling.
[02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:39.420]   So there is an analogy there, absolutely.
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:44.500]   - Yeah, I kind of think of human civilization is that, there's that movie "March of the
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:48.140]   Penguins" and they're all huddling together in the cold.
[02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:49.820]   This is fundamentally human.
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:10:00.060]   There's this darkness all around us of uncertainty, of cruelty, of just, it seems like everything
[02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:05.980]   is so fragile and we're just kind of all huddling together for warmth.
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:08.980]   And that's all we got is each other.
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:16.700]   So we started with the big question of what is God, ended with what is meaning.
[02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:20.460]   Rabbi Wolpe, I've been a huge, as I've told you, huge, huge fan of you for a long time.
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:21.660]   It's such an honor that you talked to me today.
[02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:27.660]   - I am really so happy to be here and thank you so much for the conversation.
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:29.900]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Wolpe.

[02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:43.980]   The only whole heart is a broken one because it lets the light in.
[02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:46.700]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:47.700]   - Bye.

[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:49.280]   - Bye.
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:50.280]   - Bye.
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:51.280]   - Bye.
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:11:01.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
