[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   my iPhone does not work. I'm sorry, I'm just gonna say it.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.600]   Okay. I don't know what happened in you upgraded your
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.080]   software is happy. You're on iOS 18. It doesn't work. I after
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.920]   three years, I upgraded to the newest phone, I upgraded to the
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.280]   newest OS. The phone doesn't work, meaning like to call
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.040]   people, I can't call my wife anymore. I can't call my kids
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.600]   anymore. The phone bricks constantly my photos app doesn't
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.040]   work. It is just really bad. And I think for a company of this
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.360]   scale, I don't understand how it does not go through a more
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.120]   complicated test harness that catches all of this. I'm not
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.360]   trying to complain, but because I know it's hard for them. I
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.320]   know it's complicated. And but it's really bad.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.840]   You're not the only person people are freaking out about
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.600]   the interface changes on photos crashing is a major thing. And
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.400]   Apple Intelligence just doesn't work. So it does seem key that
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.440]   Apple has gotten off their game of making polished stuff to race
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.120]   to try and I guess catch up to their perception of, you know,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.880]   AI being a disruptive force at the interface level by your
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.600]   phone or desktop. But what are your thoughts on this new story
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.640]   about them doing more chips, they've obviously had great
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.040]   success with the processors and phones and now the M four.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.960]   Incredible if you haven't tried the Mac mini best computer for
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.560]   the dollar in the world right now. But what are your thoughts
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.320]   on Apple?
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.680]   So the most important thing about Apple is remember, it's
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.640]   vertically integrated, and vertically integrated companies
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.320]   when you construct them properly, have a competitive
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.040]   advantage that really cannot be assaulted for a decade 2030 4050
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400]   years. And so chips, classic illustration, go all the way
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.800]   down to the metal in build a chip that's perfect for your
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.160]   desired interface, your desired use cases, your desired UI, and
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.920]   nobody's gonna be able to compete with you. And if you
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.160]   have the resources, you know, because you need balance sheet
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.440]   resources to go in the chip direction, it just gives you
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.040]   another five inch hang your sort of competitive advantage. And so
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.760]   I love vertically integrated companies, you know, I posted a
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.640]   pin tweet, I think it's still my pin tweet about vertically
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.280]   integrate is the solution to the best possible companies. But
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.160]   it's very difficult, you need different teams with different
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.280]   skill sets, and you need probably more money, truthfully,
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.480]   more capital. But Apple is going to keep going down the vertical
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.880]   integration software, hardware, you know, all day long. And
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.320]   there's nobody else who does hardware and software together
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.960]   in the planet, which is kind of shocking in some ways. Is there
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.880]   a world class company, a company that's world class, it's both
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.600]   software and hardware? Tesla? Yeah, maybe. Nvidia? Well, not
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.760]   really. Could they do a world class UI? You know, maybe maybe
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.880]   there's a foundation, but you don't have a different vision,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.120]   maybe a different team, not clear. Tesla's close, I guess. I
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.560]   say the software's good. If you define software as it touches a
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.560]   consumer. Tesla, Apple, in some ways, Google, maybe meta with
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.720]   the meta glasses. Trying, trying, attempting, you can't
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.080]   say Nvidia, because I think Nvidia touches the consumer
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.440]   through an app that then sits on top of CUDA, which I think is
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.360]   that's a brilliant strategy for them. But it's, it's a hard
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.840]   Tesla, and then a long tail of people, right? So anyway, has a
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.480]   lot of competitive advantages that, you know, actually
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.800]   leveraging for about 15 years now. And even back then, Steve,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.160]   there's some old great Steve videos, I'll see if I can find
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.480]   you a clip, where he talks about this very intentionally from the
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.760]   1990s. You know, he came back to Apple, he said, we're doing
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.000]   vertical integration, basically using those words of software
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.400]   and hardware, and there's going to be nobody else that can
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.040]   compete with us. I think it's in an interview he did in it's
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.280]   published in in the company of giants, I believe, in these
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.640]   perfect on point, just follow that strategy for, you know, the
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.960]   next 25 years. Now, you're seeing some of the
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.240]   manifestations, though, of a competitive strategy that gives
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.840]   you incredible advantages, is you get very sloppy in other
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.280]   places, especially over time, because you have such great
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.560]   competitive modes that you don't have to compete at the cutting
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.160]   edge of this, like the photos app is completely unusable. I'm
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   the biggest Apple fanboy in the world. Like I remember
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.360]   interviewing once with a job for Tim Cook. And I walked in and I
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.600]   said, he's like, why, you know, why are you interested? And I
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.360]   said, Well, you know, I own every SKU of every product
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.040]   you've ever produced, except I don't have every color of each,
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.120]   you know, iPod. And he was like, blown away. And but now like,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.600]   my photos app is completely unusable. So I totally
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.920]   understand, you know, it's about the frustration. And they are
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.500]   showing like the decay function, you know, culturally and
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.400]   otherwise, that eventually somebody will figure out an
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.200]   angle to rip them out. Yeah, I'll tell you, we talked about
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.120]   dictators at the beginning of this trim off. And obviously,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.640]   this is your wheelhouse as a dictator yourself, is, you know,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.640]   there has to be a constant fear that some a hole is going to
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.520]   come to your office and be like, what did you do to the photos
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.280]   app? And that fear does not exist inside of Apple. It's not
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.920]   like the mobile me you ever hear the mobile me story where he
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.560]   brought the mobile me team and said, How is mobile me supposed
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.640]   to work? They said, Well, it's supposed to back up everything.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.280]   When you buy your new phone, you get everything, you never have
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.440]   to worry about losing a phone, slammed his hand down and said,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.720]   Well, why the F doesn't work that way, fired the person
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.040]   brought the next person in and said, Now make it the way he
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.760]   said it's supposed to be game over. I don't think Tim Cook's
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.240]   doing that. Johnny Ives not there. And obviously, Steve
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.840]   Jobs not there to terrorize people.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.240]   Well, I don't think you look, you don't need to necessarily
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.560]   terrorize people. But I do think you have to go through uat. So I
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.080]   think it's pretty reasonable when you have a large footprint
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.000]   of consumers using an app to go through user acceptance testing
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.440]   is like, first base. And typically, what happens is you
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.640]   can do a process of a few months where several 100,000 people get
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.040]   it all over the world. And as long as you do an okay job of
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.040]   getting a decent distribution of people, this would have come
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.280]   out. But I want to just talk about what Keith said, as well,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.360]   it's literally not just photos, it's like the phone doesn't
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.560]   work. So there are just core structural issues with this
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:00.720]   operating system now, that makes the iPhone maybe 10 to 30% less
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.080]   usable. And everything is really, everything is really
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.560]   frustrating.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.520]   The command center, you know, when you pull up your little
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.040]   command center to change the brightness and your AirPods, it's
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.800]   just like, what are they doing? I mean,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.320]   by the way, so do you need a chip? Do you need a machine
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.720]   learning chip to do inference to figure out that when you
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.640]   constantly run your phone at a certain level of brightness, you
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.200]   should just allow the phone to be at a certain level of
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.840]   brightness? Yes. Why does it read? This is not this is not
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.960]   complicated software engineering guys.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.360]   No, but this is my point. There's no arbiter of taste
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.760]   anymore. Taste is the backstop.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.800]   Yeah, let me let me pause, double click on that for a
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.760]   second. So I think taste is great if you have it, but
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.440]   there's only so many people on the planet that are going to
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.760]   have, you know, cutting edge taste and be right. If you
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.680]   don't have taste, what most tech companies do is they use data.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.160]   Data is something that's approachable and leverageable.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.840]   Because Apple has like this, the antibodies to using data to
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.720]   measure success with the user experience measure, whatever
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.200]   success. If you subtract taste, even by a bit, you don't have
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.960]   the scaffolding that every other company would use. And so you
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.240]   see the worst of both worlds.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.480]   That's a great take. That's a great take. It's just go off
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.800]   the rails, right? You go off the rails. So Keith, you think
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.040]   that you think that what happened is like when Steve
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.600]   Jobs isn't there, and Johnny Ive isn't there. There's still a
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.480]   bunch of folks that probably think they have taste, but the
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.400]   real taste folks left, and there's really no scaffolding
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.520]   left to
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.920]   Yeah, but the scaffolding you had at Facebook meta, obviously,
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.680]   or the Google users would catch some of this stuff, without a
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.280]   doubt, like no doubt about it, you know, that users are less
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.960]   thrilled, and they'd use things less, and you'd fix it. And
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.840]   maybe even you take that to a stream, you never developed
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.360]   taste, like I could argue that about Google or meta, they don't
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.200]   really have taste. But like, yeah, you could, you could argue
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.680]   the paradigms. But fundamentally, if you don't have
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.440]   that backstop, if the taste subtracts even 10%, not all the
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.560]   way down, you're just not going to catch this stuff. And I think
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.000]   there's only like, how many people in the world really have
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.760]   cutting edge technology user experience case? I don't know
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.880]   too many, I would fund them right away. It's an incredible
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.240]   Brian Chesky might have it.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.240]   It's an incredible point, because I, if I'm being really
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.560]   insecure, I would want to say, Oh, yeah, no, we had a lot of
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.880]   taste at Facebook back in the day. But actually, we had so
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.080]   much scaffolding around data, probably because intuitively, we
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.320]   knew that that was way more reliable for us.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.920]   It's more predictable scale, it's certainly more scalable,
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.520]   right? Like you take Steve out, you don't need a dictator, but
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.320]   you need a taste and taste is artistic. This is anything
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.240]   adventure, like, you know, like scaling venture funds is really,
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.320]   really challenging. Because early stage investing is more
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.560]   like taste, then driven. And later stage, you can use data
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.400]   and scale it and scaffolding. So I think there's just fields,
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.480]   it's a little bit also you see, like the sports teams, they just
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.000]   happened at Stanford, when Jim Harbaugh left. It took years for
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.640]   the decay function, for like the next coaching regime to show
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.920]   they were completely incompetent. Like the next year,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.960]   they're pretty good next year, they lost one more game, they
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.120]   should have next year lost two more games, they should have a
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.160]   lot and then eventually became like horrible. And you know,
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.320]   there's a decay function with an organization when you take out
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.560]   the person who is the original thinker, or the leader or the
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.160]   dictator or whatever. And so I think some of this is showing up
