[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from financial samurai and in this episode I've got my wife Sydney here
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.360]   We're gonna talk about the ideal age
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.840]   to retire
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.600]   to minimize regret and maximize happiness
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:22.320]   So if you know my story, I left at 34 years old several months before my 35th birthday in 2012
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.800]   I was working in finance for 13 years and I decided I had enough because I was burned out
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.080]   I saw the glass ceiling above my head where I couldn't get promoted to managing director
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.000]   even after probably three to five years because
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.500]   There are already a couple managing directors in the satellite office in San Francisco and my direct boss in New York's
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.840]   City who was the head of the desk wasn't even a managing director yet
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.440]   So he had to get the managing director and that would take probably one or two years
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.980]   And then after you know, three to four years of proving myself more
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.200]   Maybe then I would have said so there were no guarantees
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.720]   So instead of complaining, I just said hey, let's try to negotiate a severance
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.200]   To get the hell out so I can do what I want to do
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.080]   Which was to write more on financial samurai and to travel more and just take a break
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.240]   And what about you Sydney? How did you exit?
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.760]   Work, how did you retire? I?
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.400]   ended up retiring at 35 after about a year of
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.300]   Thinking about it and being pretty miserable at work
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.280]   I got passed over for a promotion that I really thought I was gonna get
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.000]   And then I just started to have too much stress
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.920]   I always had stress on and off at the job
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.360]   But it got to the point where I was never getting any kind of a break. I was working long hours
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.040]   I was working on the weekends
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.080]   While also trying to do some side hustling
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.560]   So I was really just burning myself out and I ended up having a nervous breakdown
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.200]   And cried myself to sleep one night and that's when I realized okay. This is it. This is not working for me anymore
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.240]   I need to figure out a way to
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.360]   change things so
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.400]   you and I started talking in depth about what what I could use to strategize a way to negotiate my own layoff and
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.920]   So I started the conversation
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.440]   Basically the next day with my HR manager and then my own direct manager and the negotiation process took about
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.080]   Six weeks roughly there was a lot of back and forth
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.100]   But it all worked out in the end. I was able to reduce my hours and still get full-time pay
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.400]   I think I was working about three days a week
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.320]   And I ended up training two people to replace me which proved that I was doing the work of more than just one person
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.280]   All in all it was like getting a 60% raise for six months the remainder of time
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.920]   I spent there because I ended up working only three days a week. So 40% hour
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.400]   For 40% less use me and getting the same pay. So it was it was a great way to exit
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.360]   I was really happy and then you got a severance. Yeah of several months worth as well
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.280]   So in retrospect, did you think that leaving at 35 was good age?
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.840]   yeah, and
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.560]   one of the main reasons I feel that benefited us is because I
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.400]   Wasn't stressed anymore once I left and then we were able to start our family
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.700]   About a year or so later. So that was huge. That's huge for us, right?
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.680]   so, you know, I came up with this chart in terms of
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.280]   Trying to be more objective regarding the ideal retirement age and I came up with four variables
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.960]   income freedom potential and
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.320]   return on education
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.320]   Now when we try to figure out
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.440]   minimizing regret and maximizing happiness
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.280]   We don't want to retire too early because we might regret not recognizing our full work potential
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.600]   For example, or we might you know, basically waste our time getting all that education
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.120]   I mean, what's the point of going to college and then maybe getting a master's and then a PhD
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.200]   Only to retire in your 30s or early 40s. That seems kind of like a waste and
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.880]   Then on the income side
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.440]   You know the biggest the highest earning years are usually in your 40s and 50s
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   So there's all these variables that I you know put together and we thought about to figure out what that ideal
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.240]   Retirement age is and the conclusion that I came up with is that the ideal retirement age is 41 to 45
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.360]   And the reason why based on these variables is one I scored income as a 9
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.600]   9 in the sense that you've been working for 20 plus years already
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.480]   And so you've already kind of tasted what high income is like you've tasted whether
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.720]   Making more money has made you happier or not
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.800]   But if you retire in your 30s, for example or 35
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.280]   You might not fully know what it's like to make a high high income
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.440]   In terms of freedom freedom. It just kind of depends on where your home life is and how much respect you get at work
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   You know between 41 and 45 you should have a lot of respect from your peers
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.920]   If you've got 20 plus years of experience, I know my respect increased
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.920]   I got no respect in the finance industry when it was in my 20s
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.280]   I mean clients and respect me colleagues didn't respect me. So so by the time you get to your 40s you get some
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:39.920]   More respect a little bit of freedom in terms of potential. I think there's maximum potential once you leave your job
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.040]   In your 40s in your early 40s because you've got the experience. You've got the energy you got the wisdom
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.160]   You've probably got the capital. And so the potential is to do other things that you want
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.960]   I mean, you know retiring doesn't mean in my mind doing nothing retiring from a day job means
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.480]   putting that chapter behind and
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.240]   Just doing something creative or something. You really really wanted to do or you know volunteering or whatever it is
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   And then finally return on education
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.160]   in your 40s
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.760]   So you have worked for 20 plus years and you've gone to school for less than 20 years
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.440]   So I like the ratio of working longer than the number of education years
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.560]   You've got otherwise it just seems a little bit off. So Cindy, what do you think about?
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.140]   The ideal retirement age. What do you think? Is that?
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.680]   Proper range and what do you think about my belief that the age range is 41 to 45?
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.880]   I think it's a great range and I would agree with that. I think it's again
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.840]   Retirement is something that's personal. Everybody's different. They've got different career interests and trajectories
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.960]   I think you know for the grand scheme of thing
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.160]   I think that's a great window because again, you've put your education to work you've
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.280]   should have hopefully done well with your income potential by that point and
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.280]   I
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.480]   Think people really start getting the itch at around that age to do something different
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:14.160]   Yeah, and so that's that's the thing and maybe you're not retiring. Maybe the other word is you're you're going for a career change
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.800]   You know you wanted to job jump into a different completely different field that you've always been interested in
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.560]   But you were too afraid because you just didn't have the experience or the capital or the connections
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   And so by the time you're in your early 40s, you gain a lot of confidence
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.120]   I definitely felt I got more and more confident as I got older, especially once I hit 30
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.880]   I felt like hey, I have arrived. I've got experience
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.240]   Respect me. I know what I'm talking about
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.280]   And by the time you hit 40, you definitely know a lot about what you're talking about
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.640]   And here's the thing although the ideal retirement age
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.880]   I think is 41 to 45 because you're young enough and a lot of you still have a lot of energy to do whatever you
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.680]   Want if you love your job, which I did not love my job after 13 years
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.680]   I say by all means
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.800]   Continue to work whether it's 250 years old or 260 years old if you're truly blessed and love your job
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.720]   The issue is I think about 70 plus percent of people are disengaged from their jobs
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.920]   They would rather do something else, you know
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.720]   They ship it in they come in the latest possible time without getting too criticized and they try to leave as
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.040]   Soon as possible or right when their boss leaves and so I think if we're all honest with ourselves, I
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.200]   Don't know that many people who truly truly love their jobs. Do you?
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.880]   know I think it's rare that's why if you do love your job hold on to it and
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:45.800]   Maximize it. Yeah, hold on to maximize it because I see a lot of people who actually do make a high income
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.320]   You know, we're talking multiple six figures maybe seven figures and they're just burnt out
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.360]   Well, the other thing to think about is that not many people have the opportunity to make that type of money
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.720]   You know around five hundred thousand dollars and above is a top 1% income
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   so if you're lucky enough to have a household income above that or an individual income above that I
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:13.960]   Would I would really encourage you to try to take a sabbatical or maybe you know change?
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.520]   Roles in at your firm or take things down a notch a little bit
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.320]   Take all your vacations and try to really milk that
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.160]   Maximize that income potential for as long as possible until you really really can't take it anymore
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.460]   Because the other thing I've learned is that once you leave that kind of income, it's very hard to get it back
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:38.080]   Especially if you've been out of the workplace for more than I would say two or three years
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.040]   Once you're out of the workplace for three years
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:47.260]   Your value really starts to decline because your network and your connections get diluted
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.480]   Technology changes technology changes your skill set gets outdated
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.000]   So you've got to figure out if you do decide to come back to the workforce
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.680]   You've got to figure out how to keep that skill set fresh and your connections fresh. So that's a good hedge
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.160]   That's a good piece of advice if you decide to retire early or earlier than the normal 60 65 age range
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:16.400]   Keep in touch with all your previous clients all your previous colleagues your friends go out to lunch dinner drinks
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.820]   When the pandemic is over and just keep that connection and keep your skill set up
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.760]   Otherwise, well, it's as a hedge just in case you decide to go back to work
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:34.900]   the other thing I want to share about retirement is that you might find yourself to be busier than ever in retirement because suddenly you
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.680]   have
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.080]   10 to 12 hours a day on average to do whatever you want
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.900]   You tend to logically and rationally go do those things you really really want to do
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.960]   So don't feel like you're gonna be bored
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.900]   Well, you might be bored for the first six months as you try to figure out your new way of life
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:57.960]   But I promise you folks that you will figure out something that you really love to do and do it with the greatest of passions
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.400]   Especially the younger you retire. So for example
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:08.640]   My wife and I we decided to travel to around 30 new countries. We took cruises around Europe and we went to Asia
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.060]   After we both were retired and it was awesome
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:18.720]   Yeah, it was really great and we saw places like Angkor Wat and Cambodia. The temples were just unbelievable
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.480]   We saw old friends in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We went to st. Petersburg, Russia
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:29.360]   I mean, these are all great great trips that I've really appreciated in my mind in terms of value
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   And especially now that it's not easy to travel or we don't want to travel right now. I mean these trips were wonderful
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.840]   What else did I do? I worked on my tennis game a lot
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.520]   I'm an avid tennis player and I was able to get bumped up to a 5-0 level
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:50.520]   USTA ranking and that's a really tough ranking because it's all filled with Division 1 X college athletes and then of course I
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.240]   Spent a lot of time writing on financial samurai
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.480]   Three to four times a week and it was really really fulfilling and it still is really really fulfilling
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:05.040]   Because it's really fun to learn about new things interact with the community, you know, build a brand build a website
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.280]   These are all fun things to do that. I probably just do for free
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:14.720]   I mean traveling playing tennis writing. These are all enjoyable activities that I like to do and
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.880]   Then of course as Sydney said we were able to finally successfully start a family
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.800]   Which is frankly the greatest thing we've ever done so far
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:31.680]   I mean we feel so blessed and I'm telling you folks if you're trying to start a family and it's not
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.080]   Happening it might likely be due to the stress you feel at work
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.920]   It's so funny that you know after years and years of work. We start getting used to this type of
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.280]   gnawing stress
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   every single day and
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.640]   You know these chronic health issues and pains
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.480]   We just kind of start living with it and it's only after you
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.240]   Leave your job if you have obviously enough capital to sustain your lifestyle
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.360]   That you you notice Wow life
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.320]   Shouldn't be that stressful all the time or we've been bottling up all that stress
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.320]   All so often every single day for so long
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.960]   Alrighty. Well, I hope you enjoyed this episode about the ideal age to retire
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.080]   There is a great survey in the post which has over
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.440]   5,700 entries and I'll tell you that the first place vote is
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.660]   51 to 55 years old is the ideal age range to retire followed by 46 to 50
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.120]   followed by 41 to 45 in retrospect, I
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.600]   Personally believe that leaving my day job at 34 was too young
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:49.160]   Because I felt a little bit rushed even though I was able to negotiate a severance that paid for about five years of living expenses
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.000]   I still felt rushed because I didn't I didn't have that nice going away party
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.120]   For example, even though I was at my firm for 11 years. I wasn't able to relocate to another office and try something new
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.480]   I wasn't able to go, you know to a competitor and get some kind of guaranteed compensation
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:13.520]   And I wasn't able to go on many business trips and just feel great that ah, this is my last year of work
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.840]   How relaxing is that? You know when you apply to college I remember in high school and if you got in early
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.440]   I don't know if I got in early but man those people who got in early were able to just coast for the last
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.080]   Yeah, you know four or five months
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:32.800]   I mean that is what I would have liked to retire at least one year later at 35 or 36
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:40.080]   Really save more money experience more and just mentally knowing that the end is nigh, right?
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.720]   It just feels psychologically better
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.360]   So so just really think about things folks
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:53.880]   Retiring doing what you want is a really personal decision. I think 20 years of doing something and
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:01.840]   Is enough I don't think anybody will will look down upon you after 20 years of experience and for you to try something new
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.720]   And so I say no regrets live life with no regrets
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.360]   obviously think about
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.960]   Making calculated decisions and discuss and listen to people who've done it before
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.640]   because you cannot really
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.120]   Ascertain and and pinpoint all the different things that will happen to your life
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.480]   You just can't you just got to do the best you can. Yeah
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.800]   Alright folks. We'll talk to you later and I'll see you guys around
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.800]   Thanks everybody. And if you like this episode would love a positive review because it helps keep us going
