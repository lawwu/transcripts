[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.200]   Well, gossip is no small problem, even for Christians.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.480]   Spreading damaging reports about others,
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.200]   it feels so good and it comes so naturally to all of us.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.300]   But why?
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.080]   Why is this impulse so natural?
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.340]   And how do we fight against this natural impulse
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.760]   that we feel to speak damaging things
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.140]   about other people behind their backs?
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.560]   That's the question today from a listener
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.640]   to the podcast named Amber.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.920]   Hello, Pastor John, and thanks for this podcast.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.800]   I'm wondering how God defines gossip.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.480]   What's the difference between gossip
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.880]   and simply sharing information about another person?
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.560]   And how do I avoid becoming a gossiper?
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.560]   - Here are my three keys for not becoming a gossiper.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.280]   Number one, humility that does not need prominence.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.360]   Number two, love that does not hurt others.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.060]   And number three, large hearted purposefulness
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.540]   that is not empty or aimless.
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.540]   Now, let me show where I got those three earlier today
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.680]   when I was pondering this from the scriptures.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.580]   Number one, consider Proverbs 26.22.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.900]   The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.140]   They go down into the inner parts of the body.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.860]   Just a side note here,
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.860]   the Greek words translated gossip in 2 Corinthians 12.20
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.860]   and Romans 1.29,
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.460]   at root mean one who whispers.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.900]   Now, that may affect this translation
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.820]   from the Old Testament.
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.140]   So I think when they say a whisperer,
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.860]   they mean somebody kind of lowering their voice
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.500]   and saying things, which we call gossip.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.020]   But here's the point.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.380]   There are whispered words about other people
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.380]   which taste really good, like a morsel.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.380]   It's going down into the inner parts of the body.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.100]   And I think that means that the person who speaks them
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.300]   has eaten them with relish.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.520]   And now the person who's listening, who's hearing,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.900]   is eating them with relish.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.300]   And we all know, we know what this feels like.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.100]   There's a pleasure that comes from being
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.020]   one of the first people to hear some juicy piece of news
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.340]   about someone.
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.100]   And we can hardly wait to let others know
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.120]   that we're in on the know.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.300]   We've heard the news.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.180]   And we may be the first one who could tell somebody else
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.900]   about it.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.340]   And of course, gossip like that
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.620]   can be of two different kinds.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.760]   It can be what I would call hard gossip,
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.460]   which means you really are mean
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.540]   and you want to hurt somebody.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.840]   Or it can be soft gossip,
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.980]   which is what I think Amber is really asking about,
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.840]   where you may not have any intention to hurt another person.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.740]   It just feels so good,
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.240]   so delicious to be in on the scuttlebutt
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.400]   and to be able to tell somebody who doesn't know yet.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.640]   And now the question is,
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.380]   why does gossip feel so good?
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.400]   What drives this thing?
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.300]   Why does hearing something before others hear it
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.200]   and telling someone as the first person that's told them,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.060]   that is, they're hearing it from you for the first time,
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.280]   why is that so delicious?
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.620]   And I think at least part of the answer
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.820]   is found by looking at the context
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.400]   in 2 Corinthians 12 20.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.800]   It goes like this.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.120]   I fear that perhaps when I come,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.280]   I may find that there may be quarreling,
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.720]   jealousy, anger, hostility, slander,
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.200]   gossip, conceit, disorder.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.200]   Now, when I look at that list of eight destructive forces
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.660]   in the Christian community
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.180]   and try to fit them all together
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.620]   and find out which one of them is at the bottom
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.380]   giving rise to all the others,
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.700]   I think at the bottom would be the word conceit
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.620]   or the reality conceit, being puffed up.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.620]   I think this is why gossip is so delicious,
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.820]   why it tastes so good.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.820]   It's because it feeds pride, which is endlessly hungry.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.920]   You got the news first.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.020]   You get to tell somebody else
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.780]   before anybody else can tell them.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.180]   In the chain of gossip,
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.100]   you have become center stage for a moment.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.540]   You got the news, you give the news,
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.860]   aren't you something?
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.360]   So I conclude, number one,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.360]   that the key to not being a gossiper is humility,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.560]   humility that doesn't need prominence.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.040]   You have a deep, humble contentment in God
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.640]   and you don't need to feed your craven ego
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   with delicious morsels of being the first to hear
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.640]   and the first to tell the juicy bit of gossip.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.720]   That's number one.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.480]   Number two, the second key to not being a gossiper,
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.080]   love that does not hurt others.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.400]   Here's Proverbs 26 20,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.920]   "For lack of wood, the fire goes out.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.800]   And where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases."
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.600]   And Proverbs 17 nine,
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.120]   "Whoever covers an offense seeks love,
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   but he who repeats a matter separates close friends."
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.520]   In other words, if you put to death the pride
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.880]   that craves prominence
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.600]   and are willing to get no credit whatsoever
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.080]   for being in the know,
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.160]   and if you deny yourself the delicious pleasure
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.700]   of hearing and telling news
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.520]   that may stoke the fires of quarreling or dissension,
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.000]   you are acting in love.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.020]   You're doing what you can do
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.360]   to keep from adding hurt to others.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.600]   For lack of wood, the fire goes out.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.240]   Covering an offense is the pursuit of love.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.120]   So the key question is,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.800]   are you being motivated by love or pride
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.160]   and by the pleasure of being seen as in the know?
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.200]   So the second key to not being a gossiper
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.480]   is love that does not hurt others.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:22.160]   Number three, "Large-hearted purposefulness
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.260]   that is not empty and aimless."
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.400]   Here's where I get that.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.240]   This was new for me, a new insight
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.960]   as I thought about this particular context.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   Paul cautions young widows in the Christian community
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.720]   who've had their ordinary patterns of purposefulness in life
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.600]   ripped away from them in losing their husbands.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   He urges them not to become, quote, "idlers,"
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.320]   going about from house to house,
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.080]   and not only idlers,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.680]   but also gossips and busybodies
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.560]   saying what they should not.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   Now, notice, on one side of gossip is the word "idler,"
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:17.800]   and on the other side of gossip is the word "busybody."
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   An idler is someone whose heart is empty and aimless.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.200]   They just have nothing purposeful to do.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.800]   More time on their hands and no purpose, no vision,
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.880]   no great dream for their life.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.920]   They're just coasting from day to day,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.600]   and the result is they become busybodies, meddlers.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.440]   They don't have any significant affairs of their own,
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.800]   and so they nose into the affairs of others.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   And sandwiched between emptiness and aimlessness on one side
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.080]   and intrusiveness on the other side, busybodies, is gossip.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.600]   So my conclusion is that the third key
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   to not becoming a gossiper is large-hearted purposefulness
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.240]   that's not empty and not aimless
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.920]   and doesn't need to poke its nose
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.880]   into other people's business or promote oneself
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.960]   in the spreading of what belongs to somebody else.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.960]   So Amber asks, "What's the difference between gossip
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.920]   and simply sharing information?"
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.480]   And my answer is, to answer that question,
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.200]   ask these three questions.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.860]   Number one, is the sharing of this information
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.860]   a mark of humility that does not need prominence,
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.920]   or is it motivated by pride
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.920]   that loves the delicious feeling of being in the know?
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.760]   Number two, ask this, is the sharing of this information
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.560]   motivated by love that wants to avoid hurting others,
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.560]   or is it indifferent to what the destructive effects may be?
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.660]   And finally, third question to ask,
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.560]   is the sharing of this information
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.560]   part of my large-hearted purposefulness in life
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.640]   or simply an echo of how empty and aimless I really am?
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.840]   Three very helpful diagnostic questions.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.240]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.440]   And such a really good dive
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.360]   into soft gossip and hard gossip.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.720]   Man, so much of the Christian life
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.980]   is just holding our impulses,
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.120]   our natural impulses in check by God's grace.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.960]   Thank you for listening and making the podcast
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.780]   part of your week.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.760]   Three times a week we publish,
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.440]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.240]   and search our past episodes in our archive.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.760]   You can reach us by email with a question of your own,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.480]   even questions related to relationship issues
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.160]   that you may be facing.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.700]   You can do all that through our online home
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.240]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.960]   Well, when we return, we have a question
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.160]   about how we take personal criticism from others
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.840]   and apply it to ourselves for the betterment of ourselves,
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.380]   which is a nice little tie-in to this episode.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.720]   That's next time on Wednesday,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.060]   and I will ask you, Pastor John,
