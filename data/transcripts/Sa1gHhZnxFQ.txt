[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   Well, self-love is a loud mantra in our culture.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.120]   It echoes in our advertising and it's on repeat in our social media feeds.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.760]   Self-love is becoming inseparable from our cultural image in America.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.460]   Self-love is what we do.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.800]   So do we need to learn to love ourselves more?
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.360]   It's a question from a perceptive teen listener to the podcast.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.620]   "Hi, Pastor John.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.620]   My name is Danielle.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.400]   I'm currently in high school and I've heard lots of variations on the 'love yourself'
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.240]   mantra, constantly spoken to young men and women like me.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.720]   We're told to love our personalities, our own skin, our bodies, and our choices.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.880]   This seems like an extremely secular worldview, yet the Bible says to love your neighbor as
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880]   yourself.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.960]   So here's my question for you.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.660]   Should we love ourselves?
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.940]   Is this something we need to be mindful of or is it an assumed inborn inclination?"
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.160]   What does the Bible say, Pastor John, about self-love?
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.200]   So let's start by talking about the command, "Love your neighbor as you love yourself,"
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.000]   which Jesus said was the second greatest commandment after "Love God with all your heart, soul,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.600]   mind, and strength," and which both Jesus and Paul said was the fulfilling of the whole
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   law.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.840]   That's Matthew 22, 40 and Romans 13, 8.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.440]   Now first, notice it's not a command to love ourselves.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.100]   It's not a command to love ourselves.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.840]   It's a command to love others as we love ourselves.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.080]   So the love of ourselves in that command is an assumption, not an imperative.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:59.880]   Jesus assumes we all love ourselves, and on the basis of this assumption, he can make
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:09.160]   our inborn self-love the criterion, the measure of how we treat other people.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.720]   So we should ask, "Well, in what sense do we all love ourselves?"
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.200]   And of course the answer is not, "We all feel good about ourselves."
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.040]   Nobody feels good about themselves all the time.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.040]   Lots of people dislike their bodies, their hair, their limited intelligence, their limited
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.120]   athletic ability, me, how slow I read, limited speaking ability, hot temper, moodiness, on
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120]   and on and on.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.160]   Goodness gracious, there are a lot of good reasons not to like yourself.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.000]   There are just many things in this world that Jesus is not referring to.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.440]   He's referring to the fact that all of us have an inborn instinct or reflex to seek
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.160]   our own happiness and to avoid harm.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.120]   In other words, self-love, our self-love that Jesus assumes in this commandment is our desire
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.480]   for happiness or our desire to minimize our unhappiness.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.520]   So even people who commit suicide are not a contradiction to this assumption that Jesus
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:30.280]   has because suicide is motivated by a desire to be done with misery.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.220]   That's why people kill themselves.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.720]   They may not have any idea what's coming on the other side.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.320]   All they can right now is feel like, "It just can't get any worse, and so I want to minimize
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.760]   the mess and horror of my life."
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.720]   So when Jesus commands us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves, he's not at all saying
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:02.800]   that we should work up some kind of approval of our hair or our complexion or our abilities
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.600]   or our goodness.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.000]   He's saying that we should make the measure of our own desire for happiness or our own
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.120]   desire to minimize our misery, make that the measure of our desire for other people's happiness.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.160]   We should want their happiness the way we want our happiness.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.280]   We should want their good and their success the way we want our good and our success.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:42.760]   We should want them to avoid harm and suffering the way we would like to avoid harm and suffering.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   And this is, as you can feel, extremely radical.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.340]   I mean, devastatingly radical.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.320]   It severs the root of all selfishness deeply, profoundly.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:06.580]   You can't be self-exalting while seeking another person's happiness as much as your own.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.580]   You can't.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.520]   Now, there are two other confirmations of this understanding of Jesus' command.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:23.600]   In Matthew 22, 40, Jesus says that all the law and the prophets depend on this commandment,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.800]   and he says the very same thing about the golden rule.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.880]   In Matthew 7, 12.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.880]   Remember the golden rule?
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.880]   It goes like this.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:39.520]   "Whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the law
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:48.320]   and the prophets," which probably means that the golden rule is the same as the command
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.880]   to love your neighbor as you love yourself.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.620]   Do unto others as you would have them do unto you is virtually the same as love your neighbor
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.760]   as you love yourself, if you interpret self-love as your desire for happiness and your avoidance
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   of harm.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.600]   So that's the first confirmation that we're on the right track when we interpret "as
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.200]   yourself," love your neighbor as yourself that way, because it's parallel to the golden
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   rule.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.040]   Here's the second confirmation that we're on the right track, namely in Luke 10, when
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.720]   the lawyer asks Jesus, "Well, who is my neighbor?"
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.080]   Seeking to justify himself after Jesus says, "Love your neighbor as you love yourself."
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.720]   Who is my neighbor?
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.920]   Well, Jesus tells him in answer to that question a parable, namely the parable of the Good
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.260]   Samaritan.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:51.580]   And the point of the Good Samaritan parable is not that he liked the wounded Jew the way
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.200]   he liked himself, like he had really good feelings about himself, so he could have really
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.160]   good feelings about this wounded Jew.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.280]   That's just not the point at all.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.640]   The point is he treated this wounded Jewish man the way he would like to be treated.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:13.080]   He loved him as he loved himself in the sense that he sought his good.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.840]   He picked him up, he put oil on his wounds, he put him in a motel, he paid his bill, because
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.000]   he thought, "Well, if I were lying here like this, that's the way I'd like to be treated."
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:34.040]   But let me close by giving a biblical alternative to the mantra that Danielle considers so worldly,
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.800]   and rightly so.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:43.640]   She says, "We're told to love our personalities, our own skin, our bodies, our choices."
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.240]   And she says, "That just doesn't sound right to me."
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.080]   It's not.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.360]   Now here's the alternative.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.920]   As Christians who believe in the sovereignty and the goodness and the wisdom of God and
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   everything he does, nobody, none of us, received a body from our parents under God's providence
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.640]   different than the one God appointed.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.600]   We got the body God appointed.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.480]   God knit us together in our mother's womb, the psalmist says.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:24.920]   Our attitude toward our bodies, therefore, should be to accept our bodies and our brains
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:35.160]   with all their limitations and all their imperfections, and trust God that he is wise and good and
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:43.200]   merciful, and then offer our bodies as instruments of righteousness for God's glory with all
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.720]   their imperfections and all their limitations.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:54.000]   Johnny Erickson Tada has been paralyzed in a wheelchair for over 50 years.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.360]   Here is an example of the faith I'm talking about.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.000]   She said that she would like to take her wheelchair to heaven temporarily.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.680]   She's got an agenda here.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:11.920]   She will stand, she says, on her own two legs in her new body and say this to Jesus, "Thank
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:19.020]   you, Jesus, and he will know that I mean it because he knows me.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.400]   And I will say, 'Jesus, you see that wheelchair?
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.800]   You were right when you said that in the world we will have trouble, because that thing has
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.040]   been a lot of trouble.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:38.360]   But the weaker I was in that thing, the harder I leaned on you, and the harder I leaned on
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.480]   you, the stronger I discovered you to be.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:52.560]   It never would have happened had you not given me the bruising of the blessing of that wheelchair.'"
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:10:01.640]   God did not ask Johnny to like her wheelchair, but he did ask her to trust him that he knew
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:10.040]   what he was doing and to dedicate herself with all her limitations to him, and she did.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.960]   And we should too.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.720]   That's an incredibly powerful testimony, and I think Johnny actually listens to the podcast
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.560]   and says, "Sir, if you're listening out there, we love you.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.360]   We thank God for you.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.000]   You have such a powerful testimony, and we're grateful to God for you."
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:34.640]   You know, for everything you need to know about this podcast, you can find it at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.280]   Well speaking of self-love, how can I kill this pride inside me?
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.000]   Pride is a nefarious enemy, one of our great enemies.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.760]   Pride is an ancient enemy of God's, and yet when the Lord gifts someone with natural skills
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.960]   and abilities beyond the norm, that struggle with pride can become even more intense.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.600]   Sunday we will address this fight against our enemy, the fight against our own pride.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.500]   Have a great weekend.
