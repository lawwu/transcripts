[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   Good morning. A bunch of folks asked me to make one of these a day in the life videos to talk about
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.600]   how I do time management in the day, how I structure the routine to maximize productivity.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.240]   So here we go. The day starts now after about 68 hours of sleep. Now there's periods of my life
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.680]   where I do sprints where I'll pull all-nighters or crazy hours and so on but regularly I try to
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.000]   get 68 hours of sleep plus the mythical epic 30-minute power nap. I think sleep, diet, and
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.200]   exercise are essential for productivity just under I would say passion and whatever the heck you need
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.800]   to do to be happy and keep every single day low stress. I might give a shout out to a few products
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.400]   that sponsor the podcast for no reason except that I love using them and that's why I agreed
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.160]   for them to sponsor the podcast so click their links in the description to support the videos
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.360]   I make. I'm really fortunate to have way more sponsors than I need so I get to choose only
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.760]   the ones I really love. I'm generally a minimalist guy. I don't like material possessions but this
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.840]   AC bed has been nice. It lets you set the temperature throughout the night so for me what
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.720]   I like is for it to cool the bed and then warms up as I wake up. It's been helping me get some
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.480]   restful sleep. So I start each day when I get out of bed first thing there's a mantra a list that I
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.360]   have on a sheet of paper that I go through so I start by reminding myself of the current set of
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.680]   rules and constraints on the various addictions things that drain on my time so that includes
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.160]   social media. The current rule is I only check social media when I post which is one two or three
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.840]   times a day for no more than 10 minutes so that that's it. It's very strict. That's one of the
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.160]   main addictions I think that's important to control. Some people completely remove themselves
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.440]   from social media. I think that's one of the possible solutions but to me that's a little
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.520]   bit of an easy way out. The hardest thing to do is to really moderate the use of social media
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.360]   because when you use it in moderation it actually can bring you joy. It can really connect you with
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.400]   other people. It kind of makes me feel amazing when I only check it once or twice a day but you
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   have to be strict and then the other rules are diet and exercise so I make sure I exercise every
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.240]   single day no matter what even if injured I find a body part any body part that's not injured and
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.360]   exercise it and then diet I just have a strict diet that I follow within the constraints of
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.920]   which I can enjoy myself so for me that's been keto which is very low carb diet so the first part
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.360]   of the mantra is I remind myself of those rules it kind of sets the constraints within which the
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.080]   game is to be played. The second part of the mantra is gratitude. I visualize and meditate
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   on the idea that I might die today at any moment today so I kind of try to accept
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:04.480]   the notion that today is my last day on this earth and it's mostly just a breathe in and out
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.920]   and a pause and a meditation on the fact that it's freaking amazing that I'm alive that life is
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.920]   amazing. Third is I list out loud by the way unless I'm with somebody then it's in my head
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.080]   but I list a set of goals for the next five years a set of goals that I have and these are ambitious
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.160]   big goals that I would like to achieve in the next five years. Fourth is I list more near-term goals
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.240]   for me that's by the end of 2020 I want to do these kinds of things they're just out of reach
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.520]   but achievable so if I really work my ass off and with a bit of luck I can get it done I mean that
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.280]   really starts to get me amped up like let's let's get to work. Fifth part of the mantra zooming in
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.720]   even further I actually focus in on the day I visualize going through the rest of the day all
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.600]   the things I think I need to get done this is really quick but I literally visualize myself
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.560]   like in a game of sims like on fast forward running around getting all the stuff done
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.680]   successfully like I visualize both the struggle of it I visualize the hardest part of the day that
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:23.440]   I have on my to-do list and getting them done crushing it but really sort of focusing on the
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.960]   timing of it the beat of the day and getting it all done just like a game of sims except for the
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.160]   part where when you're cooking you set yourself on fire and you run around I miss sims I miss video
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.480]   games in general. Finally I go through a set of principles that I strive to live up to as a man
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.360]   now there's a particular set of phrases that are a little bit cliche but I think fundamental to who
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:54.160]   I am but they center around compassion empathy love and on the other side of it is character
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:02.560]   integrity and strength both physical and mental so today is a little bit different because I'm also
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.280]   making this video I don't like it it's uncomfortable it's a distraction it takes away
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.480]   from my focus but I'm going to get the job done I said I'm going to do it I'll do it so I'm going
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.240]   to do the mantra now and next thing hit hard the deepest work of the day for four hours a four hour
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.200]   session that I'll probably film behind the desk all right so I did the mantra then I drank about
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.600]   a liter of water went to the bathroom made a coffee and now ready to hit the day hard with a four hour
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.880]   session of deep work focused on a single thing no interruptions if interesting ideas come into my
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:44.000]   head to try to trick me into pulling on the thread of that idea I gently set it aside write it down
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.720]   in google doc to address later so I bring my mind gently back to the focus of the task because ideas
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.120]   keep coming but you really want to focus on the task so the only interruptions that are allowed
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.960]   is water coffee bathroom and I try to minimize those usually try to be just once in that four
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.240]   hour session I stop the timer when I take that break but I don't do anything during that break
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.760]   like social media or any of that stuff it's really my mind is still focused on the task at hand
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.240]   and hitting it hard when I return to the desk the desk by the way is a standing desk they don't
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.160]   sponsor anything but I still love them it's autonomous you should check it out pretty
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.600]   inexpensive I sometimes I sit sometimes I stand not wearing a suit I sometimes wear a suit especially
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.840]   I'm going to film I wear a suit when I go outside I just enjoy the way I feel when I wear a suit but
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.440]   at home I'm wearing a t-shirt and jeans right now I'm not wearing any pants just kidding I'm wearing
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.840]   jeans but you wouldn't know it if I didn't which is the magic of the internet if you pointed to it
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:56.320]   I can do a separate video on my setup I optimize the heck out of everything but my first love my
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.760]   home is the kinesis keyboard it's this weird ergonomic keyboard that's probably way too
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:10.960]   expensive but I still love it I'm surrounded by things I love and emacs editor although I use a
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:20.560]   lot of modern ids like today I'm working on tensorflow lite on a samsung galaxy s20 doing
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.720]   some deep learning on the smartphone there's a bunch of tricky undocumented things that I'm
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.600]   trying to accomplish not looking forward to it because it's going to be just a lot of debugging
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.960]   and trying to figure out obscure things but that's the hardest part of the day that's the hardest
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.840]   thing on my to-do list that's what I'm going to focus on no distractions that's what this four
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:47.120]   hour session is about I'm usually drained but happy at the end of the session I mean I'm happy
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.880]   throughout but I kind of dread this four hour session every day which is why I hit it hard
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.400]   early on without reflecting without thinking almost like a machine I just get the job done
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.120]   that's the way I think about it and I feel good afterwards but I don't want to do it and I do it
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.120]   anyway so here we go I'll see you on the other end of the four hours all right the four hour session
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.680]   is done I did not get as much done as I wanted but it's nevertheless a big success because I just
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:22.480]   grinded it out zero thoughts about anything else only took a single bathroom and water break so it
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   took about four hours and 10 minutes next up I'm going to do a little bit social media now which
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.880]   I need to post a podcast conversation with David Eagleman brilliant neuroscientist so I'm just
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.360]   going to post that check the comments from the previous day trying to keep the whole experience
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.200]   under five minutes and definitely under 10 minutes and after that like I do every single day no
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:53.040]   exception is guitar or piano or music usually these days it's been guitar in the human world
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:00.480]   I'm currently single but in the music world I'm in an open relationship with this beautiful guitar
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   open relationship because I sometimes cheat on her with the acoustic but mostly electric
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:14.720]   Fender Strat the warm bluesy sound of a Fender kind of like the Eric Clapton
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:22.800]   Jimi Hendrix as uh brings joy to my heart so I look forward to this moment it's an escape it just
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:33.760]   makes me happy like a lot of things do but this is kind of a private moment of joy and after that
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:42.960]   is about an hour and a half to two hours of a private set of moments of suffering aka exercise
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:49.920]   so here we go social media guitar keep the social media under 10 minutes no exceptions
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.720]   and the guitar sometimes I'll let it slip but usually just 20 minutes all right got the social
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.440]   media and the guitar done actually there was a bunch of moments which just brought a smile to
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.880]   my face both the hilarity and the love I always really appreciate it when I check social media
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:12.480]   moderation it really does bring me joy so thank you for that now it's time to face the demons
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.920]   in my mind going on a long run all the things I don't want to think about I usually start out
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.080]   listening to brown noise as I run it really focuses my mind lets me think deeply and then
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.880]   about two three miles into the run when I start feeling a little better I'll switch to listening
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:37.040]   to an audiobook I'm currently listening to the rise and fall of the third reich recommended highly
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:44.400]   great book rough but important for our times if you don't study history you're doomed to repeat it
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.480]   my current exercise routine is around a minimum of six miles every day and then when I'm about
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.840]   three or four miles in I decide how far more I want to go I usually don't feel like running
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.120]   but once I actually get out there once I put some of the miles in you start feeling good sometimes
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.560]   sometimes not sometimes it's the drag but sometimes you feel really good and then I'll do the
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.480]   eight ten maybe even twelve miles my hope one day is I'll just keep running and do an ultra marathon
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.000]   just on a whim now for the usual 67 mile run it should take about an hour and afterwards I do
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.520]   a short but intense session of body weight exercises after the whole crazy push-up pull-up
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.960]   squat challenge that I did I now do the david goggins inspired nickel and dime workout that
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.520]   he talks about so every single minute you do five pull-ups and ten push-ups minute on a minute and
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.360]   usually it kicks my ass to do about 15 to 20 minutes of that that's enough my hope one day
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.680]   is to get up to like one hour which is really tough your muscles just drained exhausted but
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:53.360]   I find it's a really great intense way to get the exercise in without taking too much away from your
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:59.040]   day hard on the mind hard on the body but good for the soul by the way all this is fasted so
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:07.200]   it's been about 14 16 hours since I've eaten last I feel great no food uh water and I've just taken
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.400]   a salt pill in case I do run for a long time it's important to have electrolytes in the body
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:19.200]   I love exercising fasted an empty stomach focuses the mind I can actually perform extremely well
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.280]   that's one of the things I've learned about myself everybody's different but I've actually
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.800]   learned for like martial arts for combat sports for intense workouts even I just personally enjoy
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:35.200]   working out fasted so I guess based on my diet but also my psychology I perform best when I'm
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.400]   fat adapted which means I'm a low carb diet it's probably deep somewhere in my eastern European
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.960]   genetics that my ancestors will go without food for long periods of time and then have to wrestle
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:53.280]   a bear to the death intensely so it seems like this is the kind of thing I enjoy doing not eating
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:13:00.960]   and then doing intense focused hard workouts makes me feel great I enjoy it both physically and
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:08.080]   mentally all right let's get to work all right the exercise grind for the day is done I did
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:14.880]   seven miles in just over an hour I think it's slow pace really losing myself in the audiobook
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:22.880]   to be honest and then after that I did 20 nickel and dimes that's 20 minutes every minute you do
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:32.240]   10 push-ups and five pull-ups it's a great quick way to exhaust the muscle also really good test of
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.360]   mental toughness because at least for me at least at home I really want to start quitting at about
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.240]   the 10 to 15 minute mark just the muscles are exhausted you have to pause it's just unpleasant
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:52.160]   takes me back to the to the month and a half previously that I was doing the insane challenge
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:58.800]   so I love it it's really quick 20 minutes maybe 30 minutes depending on the day and the one hour
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:06.880]   of the running feel pretty good not so good about 1936-1937 Nazi Germany as the audiobook is
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:15.760]   covering but yeah really makes me think about the nature of evil it puts everything into
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:22.720]   puts everything else into context somehow you know studying history sometimes is a really good way to
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.600]   force me to stop and to acknowledge how weak my mind is and how much stronger it needs to be
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:37.760]   if I want to have a role in this world of making positive change I think about Nazi Germany
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:46.880]   and what it means to be a hero in those times what it means to be a person that can reverse
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:54.640]   the decline into evil I think it's much more difficult than people realize I think it means
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:01.040]   standing against the masses it requires the kind of mental toughness mental fortitude that I don't
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.960]   think I'm ready for and I need to be most likely hopefully I will never have to play a role of any
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:14.480]   importance but if I do have that opportunity I need to be able to step up that's what studying
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.800]   the 30s the great depression on the United States side and the decline into a state of terror
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:27.600]   on the European side really makes me think I know this is a day in the life video but
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:35.120]   that's also my days I as often as possible try to think deeply about history about the state
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:41.040]   of the world today about my own mind about the science that I'm fascinated with which is the
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:47.200]   science of intelligence and the science of engineering intelligence after the exercise
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.160]   when I jump into the shower which contains the moment of the day that I dread the most which is
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.240]   the first minute that I take a cold shower I have a bunch of songs that I know the one minute mark
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.880]   of that I usually put on it could be as cliche and cheesy as uh the rocky soundtrack we're gonna fly
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:13.520]   now I think it's the the first solo is the one minute mark or uh fortunate son by CCR or if I
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:20.560]   really need a boost I'm an old school Metallica fan as well so master puppets I think when he
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:27.760]   starts singing is the one minute mark so here we go and after that I'm right back into the grind
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:35.040]   of deep work another four hour session of where I continue on a particular task focused for four
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.760]   hours straight today I didn't get as much done on the tensorflow light side so I'm gonna probably
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.080]   dive right back in but usually during the shower and a little bit afterwards I'm thinking about
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.320]   like what's the right thing to be focusing on given what I was able to get done in the first
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:56.080]   four hour session all right next fun time is over we're back to the grind of deep work the second
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:01.760]   four hour session of the day where I remove the rest of the world and focus on a single task
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:08.240]   today I'm gonna continue with the tensorflow light work on the galaxy s20 for the probably
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.040]   entirety of the four hour session now depending on the day I might eat here if I'm eating twice a
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.080]   day today I don't really feel like it I'm really focused really feeling good again that's kind of
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.600]   the benefits of the whole intermittent fasting keto that sometimes you just don't feel like eating
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:29.680]   you feel great so I'm going to eat just one meal today which will be after this four hour session
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:36.320]   and I see this as a kind of sprint to the finish because the eight hours in total of deep work is
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.440]   really what I aim to do every single day the rest of the stuff there'll be another four hour session
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.960]   but it's often more relaxed more all over the place has a few more distractions a little bit
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.720]   more fun and chaos and just all over the place these two four hour sessions of deep work is
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:18:00.160]   really what my day is centered around so everything is about them this is where that war of art the
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.920]   battle for focus for gaining focus and holding on to focus that's what it's all about some days
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:11.840]   are really rough the first session today was easy I found the focus pretty quickly and just stayed
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.720]   with it part of it is because it's kind of a new activity it's a new phone I'm playing with
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.560]   and also doing a different kind of experiment with tensorflow lite so it's new it really pulls at you
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.920]   and even though it was difficult there was no serious stumbling blocks like I didn't have to
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.840]   spend a lot of time debugging code and so on so it was easy let's see what the second four hour
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.760]   session is sometimes it's a grind but no matter what the focus is always just to be present to be
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:47.120]   there if nothing is working it's not happening I still stay in that place and wait for the
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.960]   breakthrough and the breakthrough always comes everybody's different I think of how they discover
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:19:02.240]   focus inspiration motivation but I'm a big believer in the discipline of ritual so being there
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.440]   and even if you don't feel like it still being there even if progress is not being made still
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.400]   being there for the grind because sometimes just minutes later there'll be a breakthrough
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.440]   that's how I feel about deep work that's how I feel about running too just taking it one step at a
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:25.040]   time because some minutes are rough and others are full of bliss and that's just the way the journey
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.840]   of hard work the journey of doing anything difficult I'll see you on the other end of the
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:37.600]   four hours now the two big battles of the day are done the two four hour sessions of deep work
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:45.520]   time to break the fast I break the fast with athletic greens I sponsor the podcast but
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:51.200]   actually an amazing thing that I love whether they're a sponsor or not it covers all the bases
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.400]   that I need with the kind of restricted keto diet that I have it has all the things that a
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.840]   multivitamin has but a ton of other nutrients as well I don't know what it looks like to you but
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.880]   it's actually pretty delicious I look forward to it and it just makes me feel good
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:15.040]   in case it's interesting what I usually eat is some kind of meat some kind of vegetable
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:22.720]   so if I eat once a day that's going to be about two pounds of meat a total of 1800 calories 2000
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.800]   calories for the total meal if I'm not being very fancy it's going to be ground beef like this is
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:41.040]   grass-fed organic 85 so 15 fat ground beef in terms of keto it results in a good macro breakdown
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:47.280]   in terms of taste I just like it in terms of cooking it's also easier because it's just the
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.480]   right amount of fat when it's mixed with the vegetables it like it creates a non-sticky pan
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:58.480]   situation where I don't have to add any oil it just mixes nicely and results in flavorful veggies
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:07.040]   so veggies my favorite go-to is probably cauliflower not always when I really want to
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:15.360]   get crazy and party I go with carrots that's my that's my party vegetable my ground floor
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.800]   the place I return to often my home is cauliflower hate broccoli though love cauliflower and hate
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:26.000]   broccoli you know in this politically divisive world we have to pick our sides my side is with
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:38.400]   cauliflower against broccoli what else so if I'm fasting or not on the keto diet it's important to
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:47.840]   get electrolytes this is weird this is for long distance running this is just sodium pills
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:57.760]   I think one gram 1000 milligrams of sodium in pill form then there's magnesium glacinate
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:04.560]   when I first started keto I think I was getting headaches for the first few days it's the keto
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:11.040]   flu that people talk about the salt is what cured it for me is was the magnesium there's a bunch of
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:18.080]   ways to get potassium I take it in pill form it's really just to be careful to make sure you get
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.720]   enough electrolytes in your diet especially while I'm fasting especially when I'm doing a lot of
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:31.520]   exercise to balance with the water and everything like that finally I always take fish oil did not
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.960]   plan on mentioning another sponsor but I will public goods they sell a bunch of different
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:44.240]   kinds of stuff including fish oil it's all good I love the minimalist design of public good stuff
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:51.440]   anyway so much of nutrition science is barely a science really I like to just listen to my
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:59.120]   own body and do one person one subject scientific experiments of what makes me feel good that's how
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.320]   I discovered the keto diet you know I just look at the science to make sure it's not unhealthy
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:10.720]   and it's not and for the rest of it I just see what my energy levels are like how I feel throughout
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.680]   the day in terms of mental performance in terms of physical performance all that kind of stuff
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:20.880]   same with the nutrients it's pretty minimalist so I do take stuff if I miss days where I don't
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:28.080]   take electrolytes or fish oil it doesn't really matter but I feel good but I find it's nice to
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.800]   make sure you're getting all the nutrients at least regularly and like I said athletic
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.360]   greens help make sure I cover all bases about all the weird stuff that I should be getting
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:47.600]   and I'm not even aware of so this might be the first and only video I'll ever make in the kitchen
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.720]   I kind of feel like this is one of those chef shows where I should be yelling at somebody
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:24:00.000]   about their mediocre performance in the kitchen so I throw the veggies into boiling water then
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.240]   drain the water then throw in the meat and then I guess broil it or whatever the heck the term is
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   the entire thing takes about 20 minutes but I only really participate in the last five minutes
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:18.000]   when I like when it's broiling and I mix it and sorry if broiling is not the right term
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:26.640]   I don't know what I'm doing okay anyway it's uh super easy I enjoy it it's delicious I throw some
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:32.880]   salt based spices in there and the final result kind of tastes amazing makes me happy after I
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.560]   make the meal I'll probably overlay the video of what the final result looks like I'll often
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:45.040]   eat it behind the desk sort of uh thinking deeply about something oftentimes about the thing I'm
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:51.600]   going to do in the next four hour session just kind of relaxing enjoying the food but also just
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:57.120]   thinking of course if there's somebody else here with me I'll be enjoying uh the meal with them
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:02.160]   there's nothing more beautiful than connecting with other human beings over some delicious food
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:10.400]   okay here we go all right I'm done eating feeling pretty good don't feel like being on video but uh
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.800]   by the way wearing a 2001 space odyssey shirt this is where I might be wearing a suit if I'm
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:23.120]   doing filming if I just feel like it so the next four hour session is more relaxed kind of work
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:29.600]   it's still really focused but there's a bunch of tasks this is where I might do the email check now
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:35.280]   my rule with email I check email most three times a day and the first two times is just to check for
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.200]   emergencies or respond to an email that takes like less than 30 seconds to respond to and it's kind of
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:47.760]   important the third session which is during this four hour period is when I actually spend try to
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:53.840]   spend no more than an hour but I go through the emails I read them these days I'm so freaking
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:00.720]   lucky to be getting just a lot of kind thoughtful messages so I just take them in brings me joy
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.920]   brings a smile to my face one of the favorite things of the day for me and I also if there's
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.480]   like some of the stuff I have to deal with I respond to those emails that's actually at the
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.920]   end of the four hour session now I would also be doing video editing any kind of filming I'm doing
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:21.440]   any kind of website design stuff and also the the continuation of the deep work so today I didn't
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:28.240]   finish the tensorflow light thing but I'm close so I'm going to probably spend one hour on doing
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:35.200]   some more tensorflow then I'm going to do two hours for video editing a podcast I need to be
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:41.600]   working on I usually try to put in an hour to a day of podcast related stuff I need to outsource
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.120]   it I really do but for now I'm doing it and then the last hour would be the checking the email and
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:54.240]   so on and after those four hours I do two plus hours of reading one hour paper one hour plus
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:00.480]   of literature but we'll get to that first this four hours I'm back to it tensorflow for an hour
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:08.800]   two hours of podcast editing and then one hour of email again very few distractions very few breaks
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:16.080]   on days like today when I'm feeling really good really energetic this third four hour session I
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.440]   try to make as good as the first two in terms of the deep focus that I achieve also this time is
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:27.280]   for when I don't feel great I can just lay down and watch some Netflix watch some documentaries
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.960]   on YouTube hang out with friends if I had a girlfriend this would be girlfriend time
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:39.600]   Netflix and chill for now I'm doing just the Netflix part of that anyway today's deep work
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:46.240]   but starting now on any particular day this is where the possibilities of chaos are wide open
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:52.960]   so I can just do whatever the hell I want I got some Jack Daniels I got some Stoli Smirnoff Vodka
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   I got some peanut butter flavored whiskey so I don't drink very often pretty rarely actually
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:07.040]   but the possibility is always there the night is always full of possibilities I'm a big fan of a
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:14.160]   random adventure and just being lost in it this is the time for that to happen but today as far
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:22.320]   as I know it's TensorFlow, Adobe Premiere, some email, then some papers, and some just a yes key
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:29.680]   let's go all right I got the four hour session done took just a few minutes longer I got all
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:36.480]   the email done I got podcast editing and actually just got that done in just over an hour so I had
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:43.040]   some time to do a podcast prep where I'm doing some research for a couple of upcoming conversations
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.880]   and of course the TensorFlow thing still didn't wrap it up but put it in the hour
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:53.360]   that's on the plate for tomorrow to start again programming is a grind what are you gonna do
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.640]   but I feel really good I really feel good about the day I don't know if this is a good a day in
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:05.440]   the life video but it's a good day in my life maybe not exactly in the sense that it all went
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:14.320]   perfectly but in the sense that I put in a very large number of hours of deep focus I resisted
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.640]   the urge to become distracted I resisted all of the usual urges I mean that's a daily fight and
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:29.680]   I won it today but it's not over so next I'm going to do one hour of paper reading I have a
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:36.800]   whole system of papers I read there is every single day I read at least one paper today I'm
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:44.320]   skimming two machine learning type neuroscience papers that somebody suggested to me based on the
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:51.920]   Matt Botvinick conversation and then I'm also doing a deeper read still this is the second
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:58.160]   session of it for the GPT-3 paper I'm thinking of making a couple of videos on GPT-3 and just
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.720]   making sure I get all the details right there's there's a bunch of open questions that are not
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:10.880]   yet understood about GPT-3 I think and one of the things I do when I read papers is think think
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:16.480]   outside of what the word is just saying there's obviously all kinds of different papers the ones
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:23.760]   I'm reading today both the neuroscience side and GPT-3 are very easy to understand and it's more
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:31.120]   like a canvas on which you can project your ideas so you're taking in the approach the
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.560]   different architecture the the results you know understanding the different plots
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:42.160]   the intuitions like the different perspectives and the results but all that is like very literary
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:48.640]   like a single pass of that paper is almost enough at least so far but what the whole purpose of the
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:55.600]   process is for me reading a paper like that is to think deeply beyond the paper to think what are
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.880]   the deep questions to ask and that's what I do with paper reading again I have a whole system
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:06.480]   that's maybe for another video if anyone gives a damn that hour is usually pretty painful so I
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.000]   usually keep it to an hour like I literally sometimes I'm counting down to when I reach
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.600]   an hour because it's kind of hard work it really requires focus after that is a little bit more
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:23.360]   fun reading it's non-fiction or fiction depending right now I'm working through the major novels of
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.640]   Dostoevsky because I'm going to be talking to Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, translators
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.280]   I don't know when exactly but in a few months maybe in a month I'll be going to Paris to talk
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:39.280]   to them so I'm rereading Dostoevsky I finished The Idiot I'm now working through Crime and
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:45.040]   Punishment reading it in English but I'm also going to try to get to listening to it in Russian
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.040]   like taking it in both languages and trying to understand the music of the different languages
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.680]   and how they interact how they connect what is the gap what are the things that are lost in
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:02.720]   translation that kind of thing sometimes I do it at the desk sometimes I do it on the bed going back
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.680]   and forth when I have a lot of energy like I do now got a little bit of coffee in me I'll just
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.480]   chill on the bed and read the papers and the books when I'm starting to get a little bit tired I'll
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:18.400]   jump over to the desk and back and forth so that's it I think I'll wrap up the day in the life video
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.760]   here because I'll do the one hour paper reading and then the one hour Dostoevsky and after that
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:30.320]   jump into bed and drift into sleep while continuing to read the Dostoevsky but actually
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:38.240]   after the hour of literature reading I always take a pause and do the part of the mantra that I do in
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:45.760]   the morning that's gratitude again it's being thankful that I'm alive that I survived another
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:52.640]   day looking forward to the next day and just be grateful for all of the moments that are full of
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:59.520]   joy in the day I mean just even filming this silly thing it's like fun there's a piece of technology
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:06.320]   that somehow is capturing this that other people might watch and then there's like a microphone
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:12.160]   I mean just the entirety of the technology everything is magical everything is magical
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:20.320]   reminding myself of that doesn't take much effort by just taking a break taking a pause just
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:32.320]   breathing and just saying damn it's good to be alive because uh I won't always be alive
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:42.960]   the ride ends too quickly so it's a opportunity a moment to uh appreciate the entirety of it
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:51.520]   I hope this video is uh interesting or useful to somebody I value a few things in this world
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:59.680]   one of them is hard work and I try to live by that every day and the other is I often always
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:06.960]   maybe too much talk about is love and compassion towards other people so with those two things
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:14.240]   it's one hell of a good life so I hope that comes through through uh the way I live my day
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:22.880]   this silly video and uh if you enjoy it subscribe support the kind folks that for some crazy reason
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:29.520]   want to sponsor the podcast that I make the podcast just uh brings me a lot of joy especially
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:35.280]   the people I get to meet the people I get to talk to on the podcast but also the community of people
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:41.600]   who listen to podcasts I'm a huge fan of podcasts myself so this is just a big gift to be a part of
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:50.560]   that and the sponsors support that whole effort and they create awesome stuff so I get to enjoy
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:57.840]   and share my love for the awesome stuff they create and as a byproduct of that they uh enable
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:04.880]   me to have enough food and shelter to continue doing these podcasts which is fundamentally a
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:12.640]   side gig for me to the main dream the main effort that I'm still quietly putting in the hours on
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:17.840]   again thanks for watching and in your own life make sure you work hard
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.560]   and put a little bit of love out there in the world
