[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.180]   anxiety
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.460]   especially
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.960]   Anxiety about investing my guest is a former clinical psychologist
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.500]   Dr. Alice boys. She's an expert on this subject. In fact, she's written a whole book on it
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:54.680]   Welcome to the radical personal finance podcast. My name is Joshua sheets and today is Wednesday, February 4
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.620]   2015
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.620]   You know, we are all thinking
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.100]   sentient human human beings or at least some of us think we are and that means we come with a whole host of
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.620]   Advantages and problems maybe even some of us have a few disorders or neuroses and today let's talk about how to
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.100]   Perhaps improve some of those things
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.200]   What I think you will most like about today's guest
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.140]   Well, one of many things you'll like about today's guest is that although she is a former clinical psychologist
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.060]   She knows what she's doing when it comes to the world of personal finance and financial planning and financial lifestyle design
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.780]   She's actually as you'll hear at the very beginning and just in about 25 seconds
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.420]   she is semi sort of semi retired traveling for a moment at a young age and
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.620]   is
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.460]   quite the
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.460]   financial hacker extraordinaire
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.820]   But she can also teach us a little bit about what to think and how to approach our own thinking process
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.940]   especially with regard to
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.300]   investing
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.300]   enjoy
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.940]   So, dr. Boyd's welcome to the radical personal finance podcast, I appreciate you being with me today
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.700]   Hello, I've been looking forward to this since you emailed me as a listener and said hey Joshua
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.920]   you know, I might be able to provide some input on the
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   psychological aspects and
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.900]   The I guess I mean you would have far more experience than I but the longer I walk around on this planet
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.580]   the more I realize what a dramatic impact our
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.820]   psychology and understanding of our own
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.260]   psychology has on
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.060]   Just basically everything we do everything we do. It's hard to get away from isn't it? Yeah
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.580]   Yeah
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.700]   I mean it's been a sort of a major bonus to have done all this training and
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.780]   Psychology for career purposes and then be able to use it personally and there's so many different ways that I that I use it now
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.220]   There's actually in the financial business. There's a massive move
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.300]   to integrate more of the
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.580]   research and more of the
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.340]   Guess the research that people like you and you're a former clinical
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.500]   psychologist and there are a lot of people who there's a major developing field and
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.420]   fairly developed probably at this point called behavioral finance and
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.060]   I actually love what?
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.100]   One guy in that field says he says that
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.000]   Here's to the death of behavioral finance meaning that there is no such thing as a special brand of finance
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.620]   it's just finance and it's all driven by behavior and the more we start to understand the
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.080]   Things that influence how we approach I think we can make we can make a lot of progress
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.900]   But I'd like to start if you'd be willing
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.660]   I know that you in your bio you said that you were a former clinical psychologist and you're not currently practicing
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.900]   How did you figure out how to get out of the business?
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.180]   We're that's that's the type of topic that we're very interested in around here. Yes
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.220]   I mean the way that I ended up finding your
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.540]   Podcast was through the mr. Money mustache
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.300]   blog
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.300]   and
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.980]   Noticing that you're having some guests on who post on that those forums and
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.620]   what happened for us is my
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.740]   my spouse had a
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:25.700]   had a year off got a year off from work where she was able to take a year out to travel with with the
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.580]   Comfort of knowing that she could go back to her job
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.640]   You know after that year and so we started traveling and during that time. I got my
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.100]   book contract
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.820]   And we basically at some point realized that we weren't
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.260]   Going backwards with our finances at all that we that the kind of small location
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.060]   Independent income streams that we had and the fact that we were renting out a house back in New Zealand
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.480]   Meant that we were sort of more than covering our costs and that we actually didn't need to go back to work after that
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.360]   After that first year, that's so cool. How long have you been traveling now?
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.740]   So we live we live New Zealand at the beginning of May
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.700]   2013 and so
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.540]   My spouse is a medical doctor and doesn't want to kind of give up her
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.820]   Doesn't want to get too out of touch with her skills. So she's just been back in New Zealand for
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.380]   for three months practicing
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.620]   And so that's kind of the plan from from here on and it's just sort of to not work for the bulk of the year
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.500]   and
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.620]   To
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.740]   What to have this small income streams coming in through the bulk of the year
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.140]   But then for her to sort of keep her hand and with her with her work
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.860]   How is she able to?
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:54.740]   Do how is she able to work in medicine for only three months of the year and still keep connected? Yeah, it's kind of tricky
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.740]   So she still does all her
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.100]   continuing competence stuff
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.700]   throughout the year and she has
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.580]   You know various things that she needs to do
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.620]   And of course, none of those systems are set up for someone that only work wants to work
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.900]   For part of the year. So she's figuring all of that stuff out was quite complicated
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.980]   But we did but we did it. Okay, so but it wasn't
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.260]   You're saying that she's back working in order just to do the bare minimum
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.300]   It's not like she has she's able to find a contract for three months
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.460]   She's just going to make sure she stays current. Is she volunteering or she actually getting paid?
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.700]   She's a she's a GP. So she's a locum. She's a locum GP. So she's working
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:46.180]   Like a differs a couple of weeks or a month and different different practices. So it's actually quite
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:55.260]   It's quite convenient from that perspective that she can pick up a few weeks of work or a month of work when other
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.620]   GPs want to go on vacation. So it works. It works well for that
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:06.740]   Okay, that that's what that's exactly what I was asking is because that was what I was imagining if somebody who is a general practitioner
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.140]   You know
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.220]   If you if a doctor wants to go on vacation and you've got your client base same thing for a financial advisor
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.980]   If you want to go on vacation, you've got your client base
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.980]   You got to figure out how to serve your clients while you're gone and the trouble
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.460]   I mean it's easier as a financial advisor simply because a you can do some work virtually and be you can schedule most things
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.180]   but if you're a physician and you have a
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:32.180]   Class of patients. I mean you got to make sure they're squared away. So very cool. That's it. That's a really neat I
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.460]   Guess career design and you and she your plan to do that long term
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.460]   we have a
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.420]   Five-year plan at the moment
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:48.300]   So we the plan is to to try out what we're doing for five years and then and then reevaluate things
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.060]   After that point so and as I said, we're already
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.260]   You know, we're I guess almost two years into that five years
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.300]   Very cool. So let's get to the meat
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.940]   I won't I just I'm always
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:06.860]   fascinated at people who are taking some of the ideas and the principles and then figuring out how to apply apply them in their own life and
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.340]   One of them that I think is powerful is just simply taking shorter distributed
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.780]   I do you know distributed retirement or just pulling back a little bit working in more of a
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:23.940]   Ebb and flow type of arrangement than trying to work your whole life like crazy and then retire exhausted when you're too old to do anything
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:30.220]   Fun. Yeah, and it's completely fascinating and there are just so many different ways to go about it
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.740]   I love hearing that other people's stories as well
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.560]   You're coming out with a book and it's entitled the anxiety toolkit
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.900]   strategies for fine-tuning your mind and moving past your stuck points and
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.540]   you have some experience with applying that to
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.380]   Finance and to investing I'd love you to start by just sharing with us
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:57.360]   Where would you begin if I'm nervous if I have anxiety over the topics of money and investing?
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.660]   Where would you begin in counseling somebody through that?
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:09.220]   Yeah, so I mean this isn't something that I would have worked with clients about so the types of problems that clients would come
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.540]   To see me for would be would you know wouldn't be this
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:18.740]   but basically what I found is that so, you know, so many of the same principles apply to
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.780]   apply to investing and and
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.780]   and
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.780]   You know my spouse and I've had to get over
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:33.020]   we're both kind of anxiety prone and we've had to figure out ways to get over that fear of investing and
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.820]   There are so many different ways that the same concepts apply
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.540]   And there and the investing space
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.900]   you know in terms of looking at the different thinking biases and stuff that that
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:55.780]   trouble people with anxiety in different areas of their life that also mean that they can hold back from
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.380]   from investing and an effective ways
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.620]   Or could hold back from investing at all. I just never get started
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:09.140]   What is it? Why are people anxious? Is it fear of what they don't know? Is it?
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.260]   I mean, what would be some of the reasons why people are anxious in the first place?
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:20.740]   And then what do you do to help them? Yeah, so a lot of it is it's just it's people's temperament is that they have is
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:30.060]   So, you know the things that I'm talking about a kind of aimed at people who have a more more anxiety provoked prone temperament
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.340]   So one of the things is that just you know, virtually all of us
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.780]   find losses
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.860]   Really aversive so losing a dollar feels
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.300]   equivalently worse
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.580]   then
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.500]   Then gaining a dollar feels good. So we all tend to be like that and for anxious people that
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.820]   that tends to be even more pronounced so
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.700]   people with anxiety have
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.780]   Tend to be what they call prevention focused which means that they are
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.180]   Naturally
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:14.420]   mostly focused on wanting to avoid things going wrong and wanting to avoid making mistakes as
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.100]   opposed to someone who's promotion focused who is more focused on
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:25.540]   reaching out for new opportunities and reaching out for new rewards and isn't as concerned with
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.220]   Avoiding mistakes and things going wrong
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:36.820]   So when someone has that kind of natural focus and that natural style it can make it really hard to get started with investing
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.020]   Want to ask you throughout the course of this interview?
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.140]   I'm gonna ask you some just some about some opinions that I have and I don't know if they're true or not
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.860]   But I'm interested since you are more familiar with the actual literature and the actual research
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.820]   Mentioned just to see if you say I'm right or I'm wrong or set me straight
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:58.500]   is there such a thing as an anxiety prone temperament and
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.100]   In what I mean is I feel like that was that's probably me
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:08.820]   I don't I don't know what the triggers that a professional would look for but I remember just being so
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.020]   Nervous and scared about basically anything in life. I'll give you one example
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:19.260]   I do a podcast now and so my show is heard by a lot of people and I'm more comfortable with that now
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.540]   But when I was in high school
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.300]   I remember that I specifically didn't want to be either
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.660]   valedictorian or salutatorian of my class because I would have to give a speech and
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:35.300]   I had a sister who was valedictorian I had two brothers that were I think both of them were salutatorians of their class and I
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.640]   Had been to enough high school graduation speeches
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:43.340]   And I knew if I was valedictorian or salutatorian, I wouldn't I I would have to give a speech
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.580]   Thankfully I had stiff competition and I graduated I think number four or five
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.340]   So I don't even know if I could have or would have done it
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.220]   But I know that I was just so nervous about the idea of speaking
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.740]   So is that not anxiety and so but yet I've overcome it or is there something that?
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:03.420]   Am I not anxiety prone or there are other people who have something that I don't have? Yeah, that's
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:11.540]   That's very typical for someone that's anxiety proven. So yeah, so it is helpful to think of it as a temperament factor
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:18.040]   and the difference between an anxiety disorder and being anxiety prone is basically the
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:24.860]   Definition of having a disorder is that the problem has to be just stressing and or impairing to you
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.660]   So if you are stressing and or what?
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.620]   Impairing. Okay. I don't know. Is that a clinical word? I'm period
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.300]   accent I
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.300]   MPA Oh impairing
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.700]   Accent. There we go. Forgive me. I might your is not quite tuned
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:49.300]   Yes, some words are difficult for me to to say in a beer and a beer and quote-unquote American
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:57.840]   Yeah, we've ruined the English language. So okay. So that's the that's the that's the differentiation that just because between somebody who's actually has a
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:06.100]   Clinical disorder versus something that's just a maybe a more normal part of life. Yeah, so like personally I'm incredibly anxiety
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:12.600]   Prone, but it doesn't get in the way of my life and in any way at all anymore
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.580]   so
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.020]   And we and when you get to that point with with your anxiety
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.180]   It's you know, it starts to feel a lot less
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:30.580]   A lot it's a lot easier to identify as someone who's anxiety prone when you've when you overcome and it doesn't cause you any
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.660]   problems
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.900]   What about mistake avoidance that was what you just mentioned that you know
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.780]   we have some of us are very prone to just want to avoid the mistake versus
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:47.700]   Being focused on promotion. I have a theory about that and I don't know if it's total bunk or not
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:53.700]   But I think that's probably learned and it's probably learned due to schooling because I don't know
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.380]   I mean, I look at my son. I have a he's almost one and a half
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.580]   He doesn't care a bit about making mistakes
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.060]   He just tries and tries and tries and tries and he fails and he tries and he fails and he trade tries
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:08.580]   But I look at myself over time, you know through the schooling process of constantly told, you know, this was bad
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.580]   This was wrong and being over corrected
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:17.500]   Academically, and I wonder if that's not learned. Do you think it's learned or do you think that that's more of an inherent trait?
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.420]   I think it's a bit of both
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.300]   I think a lot of it as inherent and you know
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.460]   Some of the reasons why it doesn't show up till later will just be you know
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.140]   in terms of brain development that we don't that some of those that
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.820]   That tendency to be self-conscious doesn't develop
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:40.220]   Till paper and people's brains until they're a wee bit older so that sometimes why you're not seeing it and younger
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.020]   and younger children
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.020]   that tendency to be
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:49.420]   Concerned with how others perceive you maybe doesn't develop till later
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:54.860]   So it's a bit of a it's you know, it's certainly learning can play a part, but there's also a big
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.700]   temperament factor
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:03.980]   Which is why it's important for people to know how to kind of work with their own temperament and to understand that really well
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.500]   So that it doesn't cause them in any problems and so that you can use it to your advantage
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.540]   How would you start to?
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.940]   Understand what your actual temperament is
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.820]   I have a big chapter in my book
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:24.780]   So, you know for people that are anxiety prone
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:31.900]   To kind of understand that but there are you know, just I guess just from from reading around
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.620]   different
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.740]   From
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.500]   You know, sometimes it's not the most useful thing to understand
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.980]   well, there are a few there are a few different aspects of temperament that sometimes people find particularly easy to
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.500]   particularly useful to understand but you've kind of got a
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:57.620]   But you know just googling temperament factors or that kind of thing won't
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:05.060]   Often won't be that useful for people. So, you know some of the different things that that that might be useful
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.860]   Would be more things like
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.340]   Like when it you know at one point that I wanted to touch on was this idea of people to have a fixed mindset
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.580]   versus a fluid mindset
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.860]   so
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.540]   so learning whether you're somebody that is
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:28.660]   Where you tend to see your capacities as fixed you tend to see that
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:33.860]   You know that you're not good at math or you're not good at this that now the thing but you are good at
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.380]   these
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:43.500]   Other stuff and that those things are just kind of inherent traits, you know versus somebody that sees themselves as
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:49.300]   Being able to improve their capacities through the through effective kinds of practice
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:55.020]   So like that's something that's kind of useful to people like learning, you know
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.300]   Do I tend to have a fixed mindset about things or do I have a fluid mindset?
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.180]   so sort of learning about
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.420]   how you are
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.940]   How your temperament actually influences your thinking style?
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.420]   It's kind of more useful sometimes than learning just straight straight about temperament itself
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:19.420]   Like some of the the temperament factors are things like how easy is it for you to adapt to change?
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.420]   So that's something that people
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.180]   That can be quite useful for people to learn about so
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:37.500]   You know, are you someone that just reacts negatively or has a big kind of internal reaction to any suggestion about changing plans or
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.420]   Doing or doing something new or you know doesn't like
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:46.180]   Surprises and kind of naturally has a negative reaction or feels really stirred up
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.900]   When you're out of routine
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.980]   so that's a temperament factor that people that can be quite useful for people to
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.940]   understand but generally people want to kind of
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.140]   Learn more about how they're about their thinking style
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:07.980]   More so than just this this straight temperament like it's not that useful just know that you're an introvert or an extrovert sometimes
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:15.860]   Versus you know how that influences the way that you think in the way that you act do you mean by thinking style?
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.860]   Do you mean learning style like?
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.180]   verbal learner
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:25.900]   Kinesthetic learner visual learner auditory learner that type of thing or do you mean something different? Yeah, I mean something different
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:32.500]   I mean stuff like whether you've got that promotion focus or the or a prevention focus like whether you're someone that is
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.300]   Super attuned to avoiding mistakes and losses
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:41.140]   or whether you're someone that's got a with you someone that tends to
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:49.860]   Think about have to have negative expectations of how things are going to work out. So some sort of
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:58.020]   You know some people just automatically assume that they're going to try something and it's not going to work and learning to balance out those
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.340]   thoughts so that you also think about the
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.660]   So that you also think about the positives
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:10.100]   or if you're someone that's kind of doesn't think about those negatives as much like learning how you can
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.420]   Kind of train yourself to do that if that's not your natural thinking style
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:19.740]   Focusing on the loss
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.620]   On the promotion focus or the prevention focus, so I'm interested. I don't have any idea
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:33.020]   What where I would fall on that scale myself? I've never done that introspection or taking any tests
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:39.660]   How what would you ask me to figure to help me figure out whether I'm more prevention focused or promotion focused?
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.020]   Yeah
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:48.340]   I should say that that one of the researchers who's done some really great work around this is a woman called Heidi Grant
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.860]   Elvison so if people Google her
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:57.980]   She's got a bunch of like Harvard Business Review articles and things that people are interested in that topic. They can kind of
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.500]   Look there. But one of the questions that you can use is to
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.960]   Is to to look back at your regrets and ask and and if I see well
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:13.540]   I kind of what's your biggest regret and if your biggest regret is something that you wish you'd done
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.100]   But didn't do you're probably more provoke promotion focused
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:23.940]   If your biggest regret is something where you kind of regret making a mistake
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:29.420]   you're probably more prevention focused, but it's more it's more complicated than that and the
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:37.740]   The really complicating factor is that some people can be high and both so you can be high and from you can be both high
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:44.420]   and promotion and in prevention focus and those people tend to have a particularly hard time because they tend to like
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.900]   Have this real conflict would conflict between their accelerator and their brakes
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:55.980]   So it can you know if you're high and both it can be really useful to understand what you know
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.980]   What's going on for you?
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.300]   interesting
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:05.180]   That that does help. I mean just to that question if that's a good starting question that does help because I'm certainly
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.860]   Even when I started radical personal finance
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:13.220]   It was it was I was I just got to the point where I was more scared of regretting
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:18.720]   By not doing it then I was of doing it and failing. I was like well, whatever so I do it and fail
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.180]   You know people fail at things all the time big deal
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.540]   You know I've worked with enough rich people who've been bankrupt that you know I can get through that
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.840]   But you know if I continued doing what I was comfortable with and staying in my comfort zone and missed out on
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:36.100]   Something that I saw that needed to be done then that was what I feared and what was one of the things that pushed me
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.620]   over
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.100]   the decision
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:45.460]   Yeah, and what you know one of the things that you said there was really key this idea that you could cope with something that
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.100]   So you're imagining
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.140]   You know a negative scenario. So
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.740]   You know for something so somebody's big fear might be going bankrupt or something like that
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:23:00.280]   And if people can imagine themselves actually being able to cope if that horrible thing happens
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.540]   Like obviously they're gonna do everything that they can and not make silly, you know
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.140]   I'll try and avoid silly decisions that so they're not gonna end up in that
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:13.100]   Position, but it's really important for people to build to actually think through
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.780]   How they would cope if that worst fear
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:23.460]   Happens like you know, so whatever your fear might have been for starting the podcast
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.260]   you know, whether it was nobody listening or
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.100]   Getting really negative comments or whatever it is
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:36.700]   But so people need to identify what their worst fear is and then actually think through how they would cope
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.980]   With that so people that are really high warriors people who have worry disorders
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:48.060]   Avoid doing that they avoid actually thinking about how they would cope if their fears eventuated
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.820]   interesting, I
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.820]   think I had a bit of a
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.980]   Had a bit of a
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:24:00.740]   Advantage of probably anybody else in this regard because I bet you when I started financial planning when I was younger
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:05.060]   I thought there was a I had the impression that there was a certain thing that I needed to do
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.580]   And I think I probably would have been more on the prevention side
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.860]   Meaning I went to college because I needed you know, I felt like that was what I should do
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.460]   I started putting money in my retirement accounts because that was what I thought I should do and
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.940]   I had read all these charts about the importance of compound interest starting early
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.140]   And so I wanted to make sure I didn't miss out and I wanted to make sure that I was doing what I was supposed
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.800]   To do but then as I started doing financial planning I met with
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.940]   You know over a thousand people from all different walks of life
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:38.620]   And I recognized that even if somebody started at 45 and was totally broke their life wasn't over and here I was at
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:44.860]   In my early 20s thinking my life would be over if I was 45 and not rich and here's someone just getting started
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.380]   Again on their financial plan or rebuilding their fortune or trying to figure things out
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.820]   They lost it all and I realized that it was it was okay
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:59.640]   Not to I guess be perfect from an early age and it really affected my thinking over time
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:06.260]   But I had the luxury of being exposed to so many people some of whom were winning some of whom were not
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:13.780]   You know currently experiencing great abundance on all different parts of the scale and that helped me to change my my focus
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.340]   Yeah, and I mean that's one of the you know that for me as well. That's kind of being
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:24.820]   A hugely helpful life lesson is to realize that the people are sick who are really successful
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:30.540]   They often have just succeeded at a heck like really big at a handful of things
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.220]   right, so you look at people that are successful and they'll have tons of of
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:40.820]   things that that flopped, you know that might might have either been negative or might have just
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:46.580]   They might have just been like non reward, you know, they started something and it you know, it didn't have any catastrophic
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.380]   Consequences, but I just it was a bit of a non-starter
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:56.640]   But but most if you look at most successful people they have heaps of things like that
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.100]   And you know, maybe just a handful of things that actually worked out
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.580]   So, how could we teach people?
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:10.580]   I know you're probably not supposed to say that one is more positive than another but to me it would seem like it's more useful
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.300]   To be promotion focused than prevention focused. Can we teach people to be that way?
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:22.700]   It's it's useful to have a balance like it's useful to be able to kind of switch your thinking
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.580]   Just like it's it, you know, it's useful to be able to switch between
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:33.540]   Optimistic thinking and pessimistic thinking rather than then only have kind of one train of thought
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.260]   It's useful to hold those things in balance. So
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:43.020]   There are you know, there are a lot of ways where it's useful to be
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:52.300]   Prevention focus, you know, it's really useful to be prevention focus, you know things like getting you're getting car insurance or health insurance
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.980]   all those kinds of things where that's super important, but
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:02.860]   It's important not to you know, just not to fall too heavily on on one side of the spectrum
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:10.300]   That's true that makes a lot of sense because it is certainly, you know as a financial planner I've learned to
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.460]   be optimistic and focus on the good and
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:21.460]   Funny try to so yeah, there's very interesting relationship. I mean you would maybe I don't know. Maybe it's something like you
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:27.900]   experienced when you were in in private practice, but where you are one on one hand
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.380]   motivating and
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:34.740]   inspiring and trying to hold a vision of what can be in front of your client and on the other hand you're trying to pick
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.700]   All kinds of holes in the plan and then make them slightly uncomfortable with you know
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.860]   Well, if you don't cover this if you don't like you said if you don't buy car insurance
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:48.180]   If you don't buy life insurance, if you don't diversify your portfolio, then doom and destruction could be coming your way
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.860]   So that's the strange
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:56.660]   Balance of the two. Yeah, it is a strange balance sometimes but it is a you know
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.960]   It's kind of like an ongoing project of trying to trying to get that balance
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:07.740]   And to get that balance right or as right as you possibly can
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.420]   With regard to investing one of the things that we in the financial business
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:20.340]   struggle over is how to help our clients have more confidence with their investing decisions and
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:27.740]   We do these investment profile questionnaires because also when you are an investment advisor and I'm not anymore
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:34.820]   But I was you it's a tremendous responsibility to help somebody choose a portfolio
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:39.220]   And so that's why we have the you know, people make fun of them
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:44.580]   But the investor profile questionnaires that that we've developed to try to understand how a person
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:51.420]   thinks and the trouble is that we usually have to be more defensive than
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:59.260]   Offensive we have to be more loss prevention focused rather than ultimate gain focused and the reason is because
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.580]   clients feel the loss far more
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.980]   Heavily than they do the gain and so in essence the investment profile questionnaire
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.460]   We can almost never go more
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.980]   Let's just stick with aggressive as a word even though it's not a very great
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:19.980]   It's not a very great descriptor of what you're actually doing in a portfolio, but we can almost never go more aggressive than
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:26.380]   How a client answers these questions because we have to have something external to help us not
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:31.220]   Apply our comfort level with investing onto a client's comfort level
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.900]   But I've always tried to figure out how do I help a client to become more comfortable with investing?
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:41.940]   So that they can reap some of the greater rewards. Do you have any tools or strategies or tips that would help?
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:49.020]   Yeah, so so one of the one of the things that is kind of coming back to that idea of a fixed versus fluid mindset
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.700]   That I talked about earlier. So a lot of people had this idea
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.660]   I'm not good at investing and I can't get good at it
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:01.960]   I guess this fixed thing that they're not good at and I mean one of the things is to is to think about the
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.960]   ways that you're that you're actually
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.620]   Sort of the Wizard of Oz principle like like how did you have that all along?
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:14.860]   Like in what ways are you good at investing already that you might not even be recognizing as it as investing
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.660]   So like, you know even things isn't as you know
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:22.540]   As simple as things like you invest in ingredients to cook meals or you're investing but you know
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:27.840]   Buy a car or a bike that gets to that gets you to work that allows you to generate income
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.860]   So looking at the different looking at investing more holistically
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:39.020]   rather than just in terms of are you good at plunking money in the stock market like looking at the different?
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.860]   you know, so the person can start to
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:48.180]   See the ways that they might actually already be comfortable with investing and some spheres of their life
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.580]   and
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.580]   also the person can
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.620]   you know can start thinking about return on investment and
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:04.420]   and in different kinds of ways like thinking about that in a really flexible way, so it might be something like
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:11.900]   You know investing in and LED light bulbs and you're in your house and actually running the numbers and seeing
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:16.100]   The return on investment of of that and which you know, which luck
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:22.180]   You know, what are your most frequently used lights and how long do you plan to stay in your home and those kinds of things?
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.340]   or things like
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:31.340]   investing time and like, you know your time and your labor into a project that's going to generate return and might be something like
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:41.020]   It might be something like learning about travel hacking and applying for credit cards that have signup bonuses and things like that or
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:47.380]   Like one sort of random thing that I do is I buy like gift cards online at a discount
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.340]   So like and I don't go to Home Depot and just use my credit card
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:57.820]   I buy I go online and buy like a Home Depot gift card that's selling it like, you know, nine or ten percent off
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:04.860]   Because I see that it's you know, if it's spending I was definitely gonna do it's a return on it's a return on investment
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.340]   so just kind of starting to think about
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.300]   About investing more
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.340]   more holistically and
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:19.180]   Learning that you can you know, you can develop competence and confidence through
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.900]   You know all of those different kinds of methods as well
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:30.660]   The big thing is is really avoidance so, you know you mentioned like in your example about the
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:35.260]   Valedictorian so one of the like really striking
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.820]   Issues with
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.140]   Franchise people is this avoidance coping?
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:48.020]   So in the heart the harder that you the longer that you avoid something the harder it becomes to do it
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:55.060]   So the other yeah, you know, the other big thing in terms of developing confidence is this idea that you that you develop?
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:33:02.220]   Confidence and competence from doing that you don't kind of you the idea is not to wait
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:08.300]   Until you feel confident to do something. The idea is that you're going to gain confidence from doing it
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.820]   So the your behavior influences your thoughts and feelings
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.460]   And in some ways that link
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:22.780]   From behavior to thoughts and feelings as it's even stronger than the influence of thoughts and feelings on behavior
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:29.340]   If that is not too hard to imagine it is I mean, it's not too hard to imagine it. It's useful
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.780]   one of the things I love about podcasting as a medium is
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.900]   I can go back and many podcasters or even writers will often leave their
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.060]   original episodes or their original articles or the original essays live and
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:48.780]   So you can go back and you can see what did they sound like when they first sat down in front of a microphone?
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:56.740]   And I've often wished I don't know who is a great and famous radio announcer in New Zealand
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:02.480]   But in the US I often think of someone like Rush Limbaugh has the most widely listened to radio show
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.620]   And I often wish I could go back and hear, you know
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:11.420]   His first shows from the 80s to see what he sounded like because it was probably the most awful
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.580]   You know most awful unpolished thing ever
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:21.040]   but that gives me hope and confidence that just by doing more than I can by doing I can I can
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:28.060]   Get better and I've noticed this one of the things in financial planning where I've seen this is I've never seen a successful
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:31.300]   I've never seen a person start in the financial services business and
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.300]   wind up
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:39.860]   Being financially successful at it who wasn't willing just to go out and do stuff and just to learn learn through doing
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.980]   Rather than spend all kinds of time trying to think about how do I get it better?
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:48.660]   there is it is important to think about things but some things you got to learn by doing and
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.460]   That's one of the things character qualities
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:57.160]   I wish to teach others and model just get in and roll your sleeves up and you're gonna learn and then
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:02.340]   You can deal with deal with things as it goes along is that that's along the lines of what you're talking about, right?
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:08.660]   Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about. So I mean one of the hard things with investing is that you know, there's there's
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:13.000]   You know, not even Warren Buffett does investing perfectly
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.480]   So if you know if you sort of like anxious and a perfectionist you're often, you know
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.120]   you often find people are just doing like a ton of research or
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.900]   Either they they do a ton of research and don't take any action
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:30.500]   Or they just completely give up because they feel like they're never gonna be able to figure out how to do it perfectly
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.500]   And it is just one of those areas where there is no, you know, there is no perfectly
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.240]   We all you know
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.740]   We all wish that we could you know buy it the the absolute bottom of the market and sell at the absolute top
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.120]   But that just isn't you know, that isn't gonna happen. So it is
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:51.300]   Something that if you've got a tendency to react to things that you can't do perfectly right out of the gate
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:57.700]   By kind of doing nothing then you're gonna end up doing, you know, nothing or doing things that are suboptimal
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:02.300]   I'll give two other examples from investing. I think people often have fear
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:08.580]   excuse me often have fear of investing in something new for example a new type of investing and
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.080]   One example would be something like real estate. I
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.700]   Really respect and admire
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:21.700]   Two writers on a real estate John Reed and John shop and a big thing they focus on both of them in their books is
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.180]   Here's a little bit of theory. Here's what you need to know now
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:31.380]   You must commit within X, you know number of months that you are going to locate and buy your first property
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.420]   Because of all the real estate investors
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:38.140]   I know here locally that I've spoken with who've bought and sold dozens if not hundreds of properties
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:42.980]   It all started with just getting over the fear in the first one and it probably wasn't a very good deal
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.260]   But you've got to get over the fear of okay
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.700]   I'm not gonna get a great a great deal and recognize I'm just gonna get it done and
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:55.540]   Once I've gone through it once the first time even if I lose money at least I learned and I got over the fear
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.860]   I remember another example in my own life when I was younger
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.620]   I was schooled in the and basically indoctrinated in the popular finance
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.420]   approach that the only suitable asset
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.780]   you know class for people to invest in was stocks and bonds and
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:15.260]   And maybe some real estate and then I started reading about things like gold things like just alternative
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:21.020]   you know hedge funds different things and I realized that I was scared to go and buy a
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:26.740]   Goal to buy gold coins. And so I remember forcing myself to say Joshua
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.480]   This is stupid this you are being an intellectual
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:37.220]   Imbecile if you're just sitting here because you're scared to do something that you've been indoctrinated against and so I forced myself to find a gold
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:44.260]   Dealer walk in plunk down my money and buy a 1/10 ounce gold coin and I walked out. I'm like wow I survived
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:48.180]   And just breaking that barrier to say, all right
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:52.740]   I've made it I'm now one of those weird people who owns a gold coin now
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:59.660]   I can look at this a little bit more rationally and try to understand how this market is moving as compared to this other market and
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:04.060]   I can gain control. So I've had to force myself to do it in the topic of investing
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:10.380]   Yeah, and and you just the way that you take in and process information is so different
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:15.820]   Once you once you're in the doing stage of something versus the they're just thinking about it's it's stage
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:21.560]   Okay, it really you know, the best way to accelerate your thoughts is to to start acting
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.380]   the best way to have new thoughts and you've
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:31.220]   Creativity and you know and all of that is to start taking some some action if you've been sitting on the sidelines with for too long
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.220]   And I'm definitely not
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.660]   Someone that believes in the idea that you should you know
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:41.200]   Kind of make this you should have negative experiences on purpose like that
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.620]   That's somehow, you know character building or well, you know
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:49.940]   I do think that you should do everything that you can to you know to try and make a profit on that first house that
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.020]   You buy and to try to try it, you know to try and
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.340]   You know
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:39:00.740]   Especially in terms of catastrophes to try and and not have those happen and do you know take sensible steps and that kind of thing
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.980]   but
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.300]   Yeah, it's there's something incredibly liberating about
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.860]   About making a mistake and realizing that
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:16.140]   or having a negative outcome to something and realizing that you that you coped with it and that it
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:24.940]   You know, one of the things that happened to me was that I was beginning into travel hacking quite a lot lately
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:32.940]   And I applied for a credit card and they and they declined me and it was the most liberating everything ever
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.100]   I've never been to class never in my whole life paid a seat
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.700]   I'm one of those people that's never never in my whole life paid a cent of interest on a credit card
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:45.140]   So that you know, like I've no history of ever been declined for a financial
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.820]   product, but you know, obviously being
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.300]   sort of new to the US that I
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:57.540]   He had pretty limited history here, but it was like, okay so that it was like finding the limit I was like, okay
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:01.220]   That's the limit of what I can of what I can do here. I've just hit the limit
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:06.580]   It was so liberating to have that happen. You know, it was embarrassing like for the first for a day
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.780]   I felt embarrassed but then I felt completely liberated by it
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:17.380]   That's such a such a great example and it's so funny how we take these things so seriously
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:23.740]   That fear of getting declined for a credit card or that fear of a transaction not going through I can remember
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:30.460]   Recently I signed up for my wife and I she doesn't like big-box stores, but finally I convinced her
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.980]   I said listen, let's try it
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.500]   So we signed up for Sam's Club and we went down and I needed needed to shop
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:41.060]   We needed we needed to buy some stuff. So we signed up for Sam's Club and I went there
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:47.300]   It was our inaugural purchase and the thing with Sam's Club. They don't accept credit cards. They only accept debit cards
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.020]   or cash and
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:53.860]   So I knew in advance that that was going to be the case and I had made sure that there was plenty of money in
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:41:00.740]   The primary checking account everything good to go and I had two carts worth of stuff that I was buying and it was a I
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:06.260]   Mean the bill was I think eight or nine hundred dollars something like that and I get there and my card is declined and
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.060]   They had swiped two carts full of stuff
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.820]   I mean it had taken a long time for this to go through and there's a big line behind me
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.900]   So all of a sudden I just start sweating bullets. Wait, I know there's money in the account
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.900]   I host a financial advice podcast
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:24.540]   I'm not I'm not over drawing my account but just this intense like wave of fear like oh
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:30.460]   These people are all judging me. So I tried the other card. I think it's discover card is the one they accept now declined
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.280]   So I'm saying oh man, how much cash do I have in my in my wallet?
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.180]   I was able to work it out and it since it was such a large purchase for the first time
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.980]   the for the first time at the store the
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:47.180]   My debit card and credit card company had just simply blocked the transaction and I was able to call them and get it worked out
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.900]   but man, I was literally sweating at the shame and the fear of
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:58.180]   Me having to go and take my two carts that I had spent hours loading and put everything back on the shelves
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:03.540]   Yeah, and and new experiences, you know that often go like that, right?
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:07.980]   You know was the first time that you've that you've gone to Sam's Club and you know that
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.260]   It's so often your element
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:18.140]   Yeah, the first time you do something there's this unexpected blip with it and that's what people with you know
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.740]   It's it's so there's a you know
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:27.500]   There's a difference between trying to avoid a catastrophe trying to avoid like losing a lot of money or trying to avoid getting stuck
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.780]   And something that you you know
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:36.420]   Some kind of bad scheme that you can't get out of you should work really hard to avoid catastrophes
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.620]   but those kinds of
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:44.820]   Negative experiences that are really just emotional. They're really just a bit embarrassing or a bit awkward
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:52.580]   So, you know the the people that that do well are the people that are willing to tolerate those feelings
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.000]   So there's a big kind of literature
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.360]   you know big sort of research literature around the fact that that people that
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:07.860]   People are a lot more successful in their lives if they're able to tolerate a degree of discomfort
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.940]   you
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.700]   Know exactly the kind of example that you're talking about
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:21.580]   Do you think is that something that can be intentionally trained that we can intentionally train ourselves to be comfortable with discomfort
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:26.180]   Yeah, yeah, so it's much absolutely and it's much more about
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:34.420]   Like learning as you just as you say learning to be comfortable with discomfort than it is trying to eliminate all sources of discomfort
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.260]   from your life, but there's you know been a big shift and
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:43.980]   And in psychology towards that idea that
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:49.620]   That that comfort with discomfort is just a hugely valuable
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:56.060]   Psychological skill or willingness to tolerate discomfort as hugely as hugely valuable
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:01.600]   I mean you think about all the things that people would avoid if they weren't willing to so I know a lot of people that
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.660]   Really avoid the phone so that they would they really don't want to bring customer service
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:11.100]   you know, they don't want to ring around and get different quotes for their insurance or they don't want to
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:18.460]   have different trades people come over and get you know quotes from three three trades people for a job that they need done in their
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.460]   home or
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:26.620]   That they they'll just avoid those things and you can just say how the people that are willing to go through
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:30.800]   Those experiences where they feel a bit awkward like asking, you know
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.880]   asking for a raise or negotiating a salary or those kinds of things like the
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:41.920]   Cumulative effects of being willing to tolerate that small moment of discomfort just like over a lifetime
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.960]   They just let they leave the person so much better off
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.640]   Yeah as a parent I think about this
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.540]   As one of the most valuable things I can do for my kids and I'm thankful that my parents did it for me
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.840]   When we grew up
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.200]   We grew up camping all around the u.s
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:02.560]   and the thing I love about camping is it forces you into just these awful circumstances sometimes and
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.440]   You're just stuck in the car and it's been all day and you're driving across
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:13.480]   Kansas and you have 400 miles to go and if you've never driven across Kansas someday you will and you'll understand
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:19.400]   But it's just a long day in the car and you're sick and tired of it and you're upset and you're cranky and you're grouchy
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.560]   And then it's an amazing opportunity
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:27.840]   to learn to control your attitude and to not let your attitude be affected by the circumstances around you or
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.280]   You get rained out or you get hot or something like that
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:37.640]   It's just that was one of the tools that my parents used to to bring discomfort into our lives
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.440]   And we had a great time and there's all kinds of peak experiences as well
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.560]   But the discomfort is so valuable and I look at what a great gain
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:52.640]   We can how how how well we can serve young people if we give them opportunities to be uncomfortable
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:46:01.680]   While they're young so they can learn to control their attitude learn to control their emotions learn to control their feelings about it
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:07.520]   While it's you know while they're young rather than having to be 43 years old and all of a sudden
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:14.320]   Blowing up at somebody because they've treated you unkindly or because they've been short with you
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.600]   Far better to learn that when you're young
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:20.000]   For sure
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.160]   So as we start to wrap up here is
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.720]   Is there anything else on any other ideas that you have or other thoughts that you have that would be helpful to listeners who are?
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.000]   Working to overcome and tame their anxiety
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.640]   Yeah, so I mean there are a few like just little sort of tips and tricks that people can use
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.000]   one of the
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.720]   you know specifically about investing one of the things that people can find quite helpful sometimes is to
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:50.000]   Write a letter from their future self back to their current self. So
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.640]   we often feel like
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.560]   Like our future self like a you know that the self we're gonna be and you know
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:02.720]   20 or 30 years time as almost like a different person from from our current self
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.920]   So sometimes it feels like the consequences of either
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.000]   You know making good financial decisions or not so good ones are gonna be almost
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.440]   Experienced by someone else rather than by you just an older version of you
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:18.280]   So one so one thing people can do is like, you know, maybe write a letter
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:25.080]   Back to the back to their current self from there, you know, they're 20 years older version of themselves
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:29.760]   You know saying thanks for going through that that thanks for going through those initial
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:35.600]   Stages where you really didn't feel like you were you knew what you were doing or thanks for going
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:41.920]   You know staying the course when there was that downturn in the market you felt like point, you know yanking all your money out
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.840]   all those kinds of things to try and sort of
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.440]   bridge that gap from your current
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.480]   current self to your future self so that they start feel so it starts feeling like
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.880]   all these good things that you're gonna be doing are actually the benefits are actually gonna be
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:02.880]   Experienced by you at some point in the future and not like some different completely different person. It's a great idea
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.420]   I could probably be applied to far more than just finance
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:09.480]   That can be applied to what we eat and how we move and how we live our lives
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.440]   Yeah, and I mean the other thing is
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:16.040]   You know is to I guess to make a plan
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.000]   So, you know
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.200]   one of the things that sort of I found useful and thinking about my own like asset allocation and things was to you know to
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.240]   Look back and actually see like if I had that allocation back in you know
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:36.480]   2008 2009 what would have happened to my investments and like how would I have handled that and thinking about you know, if you
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.040]   You want to understand what your own worry is?
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.560]   like as you as you were concerned that you're gonna yank your money out of your investments if there's a
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:51.440]   If there's a downturn or as you're concerned that you're gonna maybe not yank your money out, but you're gonna not keep
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:57.160]   You're not gonna keep you contribute contributions up or kind of looking at different scenarios of
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.600]   From what you know about your own behavioral patterns and your own thought patterns
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:08.720]   What you know what you might be inclined to do and coming up with like an actual behavioral plan for what you do in that
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.520]   Situation like who would you talk to what sort of data would you look at?
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.400]   Before you before you did something rash
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.480]   You know, those those are you know
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:26.160]   Those are a few options for what somebody could do, you know, it's
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.600]   it's being pessimistic and being somebody that
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:36.560]   That that thinks about what could go wrong is not a negative thing
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.880]   that's a you know, that's my natural temperament and you know used to probably feel a little bit and
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:46.760]   Ashamed of that being my natural temperament or like people would you know
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.840]   tell me to be more more more relaxed or more happy-go-lucky or those kinds of things and
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.240]   What I've kind of learned about myself and what you know
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:00.880]   It's true for a lot of other anxious people is that they actually feel better when they're when they're prepared
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.080]   for
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   Things that could go wrong
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.600]   And there are ways that you can do that that are actually useful
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:12.880]   Versus and there are ways that are not useful like, you know
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.760]   Just doing continually doing research on a topic
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:21.720]   But never getting to the point where you feel like your plant you like your plan is perfect enough as obviously not useful
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.440]   whereas having like a you know, a three-point plan for what you're going to do if some
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.200]   Concerning thing happens is
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:36.880]   As a as far more useful I can give two practical examples
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.480]   from the world of financial planning of ways that I
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.800]   See in ways that I've learned to apply exactly what you said
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:50.120]   You said make a plan and then make a plan for being prepared when things go wrong on the making a plan thing
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:56.640]   I see that as a primary foundation of a good investment strategy is to decide in advance
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.720]   What your course of action is going to be?
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.800]   when
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:08.440]   Circumstances happen so whether and and this would vary depending on your
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:13.800]   You know your style of investing so some people might be having a very active
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:18.200]   trading style of investing and they say and they're putting in place and they're saying well if
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:24.960]   If this company that I'm investing in if the share price moves by this percent, that's my trigger to sell
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.720]   The key is having that written down and on paper in black and white
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:34.120]   So that when you're in the midst of the emotion you can go back and you can look at your plan
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.120]   And of course, you can always change your plan
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:43.560]   But at least force yourself to be accountable and say I'm changing my plan because of this new information that I didn't have before
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:49.400]   and make sure that you're not just simply changing your plan because now you're feeling the fear or the euphoria of
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:55.040]   Whatever phase you are in a market cycle, and I think this will force you to understand your plan
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.920]   So that would be it could be applied by an active
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:04.520]   Trader or it could be applied. Let's say that somebody is following a very consistent buy and hold
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:08.560]   Style of investing in this scenario
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:16.600]   then I know that my plan is to do absolutely nothing and I know that over time that will work out because
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:23.560]   The over the majority of the time my investments will increase in value and there will always be massive gut-wrenching
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.880]   temporary anomalies, so if I own a
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:31.320]   Portfolio of index funds then I know when the market drops by 30%
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.720]   I will do nothing and because I've thought it through ahead of time
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:39.000]   I know I'm not gonna change anything and then if you if that makes you uncomfortable
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:45.520]   Then with that with that thought because some people in the audience are saying absolutely and some people are squirming like how could you ever do?
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.640]   That if that makes you uncomfortable, then you know, you've got the wrong investment plan
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.720]   You know that you're not going to be comfortable going through that. So you need a different plan that's gonna suit your natural
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.920]   personality
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:02.640]   As far as actual the how to apply it. I think it can be applied on the portfolio perspective
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:07.960]   But the powerful tool that I hear a few people talk about is what I call financial planning
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:15.440]   Which is how can I put some some planning in place so that I'm prepared if things go wrong in my investment portfolio?
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:21.960]   Example would be this let's assume that I have all of my invested in all of my money invested in the general
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.200]   you know stock market and it's
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.480]   2008 and all of my money is there and
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.440]   I lose my job and my wife loses her job
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:36.560]   Well all of a sudden and we don't have any savings. That would be a key thing. Well all of a sudden
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:42.680]   I'm gonna be freaking out when my portfolio is down 30% and I've lost my job
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.800]   But these are these might be disconnected things or they might be connected
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.360]   The key is to be able to differentiate from them
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:53.680]   So I need to think of that in advance and I need to say what do I what am I going to do?
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:59.920]   If that happens, well, it would be wise for me to have savings have assets that aren't in market
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:05.800]   If I know I'm gonna be freaking out maybe I would lower my debt burden or eliminate my debt so that I can be more
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   Comfortable in that scenario. Maybe I will make sure that my portfolio is balanced in such a way
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.080]   But I'm gonna think through that in advance and then by thinking through it
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.460]   I can put some planning things in place today because I'm not smart enough to know
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:25.280]   exactly when the market as a general whole made up of millions and millions of people the collective actions of millions of people all of
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.520]   Whom are making their own individual decisions about when to buy and when to sell and what to do
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.800]   I'm not smart enough to predict the actions of millions of people
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:39.080]   But I can look at my life and I can plan and say if this happens then I need this in place if that happens
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.200]   then I need this other thing in place and that can alleviate the anxiety of
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.360]   What happened?
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.760]   you know how of
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:52.440]   That can alleviate my anxiety if certain events happen because I've thought them through in advance and I know what I would do
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:57.720]   Yeah, I mean what I mean one of the points that I would make is that I
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:02.800]   That there may not mean if for somebody there may not be a plan
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:09.840]   So this idea that that that if you feel uncomfortable, it's the wrong plan that there are for someone
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:16.760]   That's anxiety prone who's very, you know, very conscious of any kinds of losses or you know, any kinds of mistakes
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:22.080]   they might not there might not be any version of a plan where they feel a sense of of
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:29.080]   Comfort with with you know with losses and it's I guess, you know thinking about you know
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:36.460]   What would feeling what would feeling uncomfortable feel like and what's the sort of what's the level of?
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:41.560]   Discomfort and what types of discomfort are you able to tolerate?
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:47.680]   You know this is trying to sort of you know, especially the the
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:54.800]   And when I say American way, but like I mean sort of the way the Western world is this idea that we that we want to
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:59.000]   Avoid all all sources of discomfort and you know
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.160]   You were saying before about that the importance of not doing that so there might not be a version that feels
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.280]   that feels comfortable but
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:11.120]   Sort of separating that out and thinking what's the right?
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:14.400]   You know, what are the what are the the right things to do?
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.880]   regardless of how comfortable or uncomfortable it feels and
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.800]   For somebody that's very anxious
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:28.200]   That might be what they need to do because they might if they spend their whole time searching for something that feels comfortable
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   They might never ever get started because there's no perfect thing that actually makes them feel completely
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:37.120]   comfortable and even and people learning that like that even
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.480]   Even when you're doing the right thing
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:47.560]   There are there can be these moments of massive discomfort and learning sort of through experience that that's not in this
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.080]   you know that those
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:56.680]   That those anxiety feelings are not some are often false alarms are often just about the fact that you're doing something new
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.840]   Rather than them being kind of real
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:03.720]   Alarms telling you that you're doing the wrong thing. I
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:07.320]   See your point
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.080]   It makes sense
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:14.440]   It's hard to know where that line is though because I've served I've turned away people and I've simply said listen
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.760]   You should not be investing in public and trade of securities
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:21.880]   Like there are some people who they can't you know, the fact of being out of control entrepreneurs as an example
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:28.640]   Many entrepreneurs thrive on this sense of control and for them. They're just gonna make bad bad decisions
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:34.560]   And so I've often just thought you know, you're better off investing in this different this other type of thing
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.960]   You're better off investing in private businesses. You're better off investing in real estate
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:46.160]   You're better off investing but then to someone else who is comfortable with that you're better off, you know investing in public and trade of securities
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:51.280]   and it's always it's a challenge to figure out where that line is because I think that
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:55.320]   The whole reason why
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.960]   It's why it's tough because I think that both of those things are absolutely true
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:04.320]   There is no such thing as the elimination of risk. There's no such thing as perfect safety
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:09.680]   It doesn't exist. But yet we do I think our temperament is important
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.300]   Yeah
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:16.040]   And how to how to meet it but not how to be a slave to it just because you know
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.200]   I'm not gonna invest in this type of investment because I just don't I'm scared of it
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.880]   I don't want to learn anything about it. Well, that's probably not a useful
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.080]   character trait
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.080]   recognize your temperament
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:32.080]   But also recognize that you can learn something about it and you can be you can feel more confident with education
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:37.640]   Yeah, no, I mean, I absolutely agree with what you what you're saying there what I'm kind of
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:42.680]   particularly talking about as the as the person who's very anxious and
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:50.200]   Can and there's no version that makes them feel completely comfortable. There's not starting a business. There's not investing in real estate
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.240]   There's not having you know
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:57.280]   50% of their asset allocation and bonds that all of those things make them feel nervous
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:01.400]   So if you're one of those people with all of those things that make you feel nervous, you know
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:06.320]   You you want to go with that you do you want to find that the the thing about them saying?
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:11.880]   Yeah, the best diet is the diet that you'll stick to right right about so it's kind of working. I
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:16.840]   Absolutely agree with what you're saying that it's really important to understand your
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:25.480]   Understand your temperament but also be really and it's really important that if you're somebody that when nothing makes you feel comfortable
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:28.640]   to pick something
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:33.500]   Any other tips on your list or anything else that you want to mention that would be useful to the audience
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:37.120]   Maybe
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:43.160]   Figuring out what kind of monitoring works best for you. I think it's kind of an important part of an investing plan as well
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.640]   How do you like?
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.440]   so with a
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:53.040]   Checking in on your portfolio once a month is useful or getting email alerts when there's some kind of you know
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.040]   Change in the market like setting up alerts
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.480]   you know that if you know the
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.040]   Stock price drop drops by a certain amount that you know
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.320]   And you that's on sale and you want to buy some or just kind of figuring figuring that out
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:12.720]   I think that that can be quite important that people who are anxious tend to either over monitor or under monitor
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.320]   So kind of figuring figuring that out is important
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.720]   And I'd also just say, you know
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:26.080]   Really think it kind of coming back to that idea of thinking about this holistically like thinking about your whole money picture really whole
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.840]   so that you know working on the things that feel possible for you, so if
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.120]   you know if things like
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:40.440]   Reducing expenses by you know, making those customer service calls to get
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.320]   to get your
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.200]   insurance rates down or those kinds of things or asking for a raise or
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:53.440]   Like doing all of that seeing all of those things that you do to improve your money picture is sort of part of the same
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:01:02.420]   Goal of becoming of developing your confidence and incompetence and in the money arena and that you can start
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:07.160]   You know wherever you feel able to start with those types of things
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:16.040]   Yeah, the comfort level with a calculator to calculate the unit price at the store is no different than the comfort level of sitting
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.680]   down and
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.480]   Calculating what you believe to be the intrinsic value of coca-cola
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:29.200]   There's a few more numbers involved, but the steps are the same and so getting used to that method of thinking I think can
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.680]   Can really be a valuable?
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.400]   education
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.800]   Anything else on your list?
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.960]   I
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.160]   Thank you for coming on
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:44.680]   I love having professionals like you in the audience because it helps me to well
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.160]   I love it
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.800]   I love it because I can air some of my wacky ideas and then be set straight or
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.040]   Kind of feel good about wow. I came to that accidentally and
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:02:01.840]   And here is a little bit of external external corroboration. When does your book come out? It comes out much the third. So yeah
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:07.000]   Exactly a month from when we're taping this. Okay. Yeah, so we're recording on February the 3rd
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.960]   This will probably go out either this week or next
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.360]   So it kids is available now for pre-order if any on Amazon or anything like that
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:21.520]   Yep, so it's available in both paperback and Kindle version on Amazon and will be available in all the usual places
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.320]   That books are sold and go ahead and just give us a quick a quick advertisement on it as far as what's in it
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:32.240]   What's it about who it would be a good fit for? Yep. So it's called the anxiety toolkit
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.680]   And it's really practical
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.600]   it covers
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.060]   Discrimination so over over thinking about things like, you know when you get stuck on
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.320]   You know
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:49.560]   Maybe you have an awkward conversation with somebody and then it sort of sticks in your mind and fun find yourself sort of lying awake
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.880]   At night thinking about it or driving home in the car thinking about it
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:58.200]   It covers hesitating too long before making decisions covers perfectionism
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.680]   Covers avoidance coping it's aimed at
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:10.920]   It's intended to be helpful both for people who have actual anxiety disorders, but more so people
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:18.760]   Who have an anxious thinking style who might want to learn about their thinking and behavioral patterns a bit more
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.640]   How cool that you can do your book tour while you're traveling?
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:28.560]   And work with I would assume you've got kind of a book launch strategy and lining up the media
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.560]   How cool that you can be on the road?
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:36.320]   Enjoying a location independent lifestyle and still write and publish your book and do the publicity. What a cool world we live in
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.640]   Yeah, it's a very cool world. I know you have a website Alice boys calm
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.160]   Anywhere else that you want people to know about you?
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.440]   Yeah, the Alice boys calm one is as a as one that I had for my practice
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.400]   So that's not very active at the moment the the two places that I am
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:57.700]   That I'm more active the book website, which is the anxiety toolkit
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.480]   Calm and also my blog for psychology today calm
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.960]   So I wrote my I wrote a blog on my own site up until about
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:10.760]   2012 and then all my new articles since then are on my blog for psychology today calm
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:15.720]   Very cool. I'll make sure that those are on here. Those are listed in the show notes. Dr. Boys
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.520]   I appreciate you making time to come on. Good luck safe travels to you. Thank you
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:26.160]   Perhaps I shouldn't try to do therapy for myself right live on the air
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.640]   But hey, it's not every day you get a former clinical psychologist to talk to you
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.800]   And sometimes it's nice to learn a little bit about something about yourself, isn't it?
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.800]   At least I enjoy that after all it's one of the reasons why I do the show the way that I do it
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.120]   I get to learn something
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:44.200]   I'm not an expert in everything. I'm an expert in maybe just a couple of things
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:50.260]   But the rest of the time I'm just interested and a little bit of introspection and knowing yourself even as dr
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.260]   Boys emphasize can be so so useful
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.040]   So thank you so much as we go today. I'm gonna read a couple of iTunes reviews
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.880]   And if you enjoy the show or if you hate the show, you wouldn't be here at that point
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.200]   But if you enjoy the show, please leave an iTunes review and make sure that you're subscribed in iTunes
