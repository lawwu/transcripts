[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   All right, rapid fire.
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.960]   Got a question here from Kobe.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.920]   Should I solely focus more on developing my skillset
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.680]   as a stock investor to the point
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.680]   where my skillset cannot be ignored?
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.160]   Or should I build my skillset as a stock investor
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.480]   and at the same time continue to teach live courses
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.880]   on stock investing?
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.480]   It's getting to a point where I feel like I have
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.280]   to convince people to join my program
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.080]   and that's getting draining.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.040]   All right, Kobe, my general answer is focus on the stocks.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.000]   All right, focus on the primary thing you're doing,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.160]   which sounds like it's stock investing.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.680]   The course is a side hustle that do it at this point
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.880]   only if it was entertaining or relaxing.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.880]   You're finding it draining.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.760]   Focus on the stocks.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.300]   Presumably, if you're good enough at the stocks
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.720]   to be able to teach a course on it,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.200]   you should be making more than enough money
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.680]   from the stocks to not need the course financially.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.000]   If you need the course financially,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.500]   then you're not good enough at stocks to teach that course.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.540]   So I think we've got a great self-referential solution here.
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.220]   My tough love, specific answer, however, Kobe,
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.660]   is you're not gonna teach yourself to beat the stock market.
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.700]   Let me tell you this as someone who comes out
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300]   of elite Ivy League schools where I've watched people
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.100]   go off to prop trading desk at Wall Street firms.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.320]   The very smartest people in the world
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.480]   are incredibly well compensated to do nothing
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.620]   but spend all day training and executing
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.960]   the best possible plans to make money on the stock market.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.020]   And even they can't consistently do it.
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.260]   I had a friend in college, I remember talking to him
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.900]   about his job a few years out of college.
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.580]   All he did was had CEOs, a small number of CEOs
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.880]   of publicly traded companies, and his whole job
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.640]   was to listen to every public announcement
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.620]   or discussion or conversation they ever have
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.420]   and really learn the nuances of this individual person
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.980]   so they could pick up just subtle edges
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.060]   in what's going on with this person's company.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.440]   You're not gonna learn some momentum trading technique
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.300]   on the internet that's gonna have you consistently
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.940]   build the market.
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.060]   You are probably the sucker there.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.880]   And so that's my tough love thing.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.360]   Invest in index funds, put your time and energy
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.080]   into other ways of making.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.980]   (upbeat music)
