[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   We're here at BogleHeads9 with our mentor, Jack Bogle.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.120]   Jack, thanks for speaking with us.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.560]   Always my treat, thank you.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.240]   One of the striking things that I heard you say at one of my first meetings was that you
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.760]   could teach just about everything about investing in just a few minutes.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.600]   If I were to put you in front of every single person in the country for those few minutes,
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.440]   what would you say to them?
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.240]   Well I'd say first, invest you must.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.760]   If you don't put money away, you'll end up with nothing.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.760]   Pretty clear.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.720]   How to invest, don't make it any more complicated than it is, own the stock market and own the
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.720]   bond market.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.720]   And you can own the stock market through an old market index fund, you can own the bond
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.600]   market through an old bond market index fund, and that's the most sensible way to invest.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.360]   And you have to figure out kind of for yourself, if you're young you want to be very heavily
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.360]   towards stocks.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.000]   If you're old and you've got more wealth, less appetite for risk, need income more,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.320]   you want to lean, tilt heavily to bonds, it's a lifetime asset allocation struggle.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.440]   And just make sure the funds you buy are low cost, don't pay sales loads, watch out for
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.040]   funds that have high turnovers, index funds do not.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.600]   Make sure you have very, very low cost, operating cost, and zero management cost, which you
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.240]   do in an index fund.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.840]   And then be careful of tax efficiency, because trading is very expensive, you pay taxes and
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.860]   that devastates long term investment returns.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.240]   So it's the bond market and the stock market, get the cost out of the equation.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.360]   And I guess my final piece of advice would be, don't peek, just put your money away month
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.420]   after month after month after month, and don't look.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.280]   And if you start when you're 20 and retire when you're 80, which I'm thinking about doing
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.920]   but haven't decided to do it yet, and you see what that account is worth in 60 years,
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800]   you aren't going to believe it.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.360]   Throw everything else out along the way.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.680]   That sounds like fantastic advice.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.520]   So when you're tempted to peek, or even worse, when you're tempted to do something in response
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.080]   to everything else that's going on, what should we do?
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.600]   How do we avoid that?
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.480]   Well there's this great sort of American ethic that we can always win, and the great statement
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.260]   is, don't just stand there, do something.
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.920]   And my advice is, don't do something, just stand there.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.200]   Because we get most excited and most depressed and most likely to sell when the market's
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.160]   at a low, and we get most elated and most optimistic when the market's at a high.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.920]   When the market's at a low, you're tempted therefore to sell.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.520]   When the market's at a high, you're tempted to buy.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.440]   So don't try and tie in the market.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.160]   I've often said that I don't know how to tie in the market.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.320]   I don't know anybody who's ever been able to tie in the market successfully, and I don't
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.160]   even know anybody who knows anybody that's tied in the market successfully.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   That's a lot of people.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.200]   One last thing.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.440]   Your career spans 60 years, and you've done a lot of amazing things and achieved quite
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.120]   a bit in that time.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.960]   Maybe 60 years from now, what would you want people to remember about you or remember about
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   your accomplishments or achievements?
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.440]   I don't spend a lot of time thinking about that.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.720]   But it would be something like, he was an ordinary person who did his best.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.400]   How about that?
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.840]   Thank you.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   Thank you.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   Thank you.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   Thank you.
