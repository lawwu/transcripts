[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.320]   Hey Radicals, this is Joshua Sheets, host of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, here
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.320]   today with a book review for Brian Tracy's book, Eat That Frog. 21 great ways to stop
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.880]   procrastinating and get more done in less time. So, Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy. This
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.480]   book for me is a five-star book review. I love this book. Now let me tell you why so
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.080]   you can decide if it's right and useful for you. But I absolutely love this book. Of all
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.240]   of the productivity books that I have read, this one is one of the most pithy, concise,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   and yet comprehensive books. It's a great comprehensive overview that touches on each
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.320]   of the key important elements of productivity, but doesn't go too deep. And so for me, it's
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.280]   really, really useful as a reminder book, as a review book. There are many great books
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.880]   on productivity that go deep on the philosophy or on the science or on a specific tool. A
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.740]   lot of them go shallow and just talk about the value of a certain tool, a certain approach.
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.440]   But there are very few books that give you a comprehensive overview and this is a great
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.940]   one to do that. Brian Tracy goes through 21 specific ideas and he starts with the big
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.160]   picture ideas of concept and of mindset, talking about how to make sure that you're doing the
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   right things. The biggest waste of time is to do something well that doesn't need to
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.120]   be done at all. Then focusing in on the highest priority things, how to run all the things
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.400]   that you do out of your list of goals to make sure that you're doing the right things. And
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.720]   then he ultimately goes down to some simple mindset tricks, some simple ways to make sure
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.960]   that you can trick yourself into being more focused and more productive. For me, the major
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.840]   benefit of this book is as a constant review and refresher on productivity. If you think
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.560]   about it, the key for all of us is to be able to produce more valuable work during the time
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   that we work. I learned from Brian Tracy the phrase, "It's quality of time at work that
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.400]   matters and quantity of time at home." And so his whole focus is to say, "During the
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.600]   time that you work, how can you make sure that you get the highest quality of output
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.840]   and the most of it so that you can spend more time, more quantity of time at home doing
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.720]   the things that you want to do with your family and being present with them?" So the focus
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.480]   of productivity is remember, we all get paid based upon the volume, the quality, and the
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.180]   value of the work that we produce. So in order to get paid more, we always need to increase
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.040]   our output. We need to increase the value of that output and we need to increase the
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.320]   quantity of the output. So anything we can do to improve our working ability is going
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.400]   to be helping us. I don't know about you, but I don't find for me that I'm just some
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   automatic productivity wizard all the time. I find plenty of challenges that I'm never
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.040]   perfect. So the way I like to use Brian Tracy's book, "Eat That Frog" is as a continual
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.080]   review. It's a very short audio book, couple hours long, two and a half hours. I like to
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.720]   listen to it at 2x speed. So by listening to it at 2x speed, that means that I can listen
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.580]   to it in about an hour and a half. And so once a month, if I take an hour and a half
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.840]   and I listen to the book, then I'll pick up on a little specific tip that I'm not doing
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.640]   well. Or I'll pick up on something that's important and meaningful to me today that
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.120]   another time I probably wouldn't have recognized. And that's the primary value. This is one
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.440]   that I think is a must own. You definitely want to own this audio. You want to keep it
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.360]   on your phone or you want to own the book and you want to just have it regularly there
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.720]   so that it's a regular part of your routine, whether it's once a month or every couple
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.120]   of months, every six months. You go through it again and look for the next thing that
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.040]   you can focus on. Because depending on where you are, it's going to be a little different.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.120]   Are you prioritizing effectively? Are you only working on the things that need to be
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.200]   done? Do you have good systems? Do you need to upgrade your tools? Whatever it is that's
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.360]   appropriate to you, you'll be able to pick that up as you consistently review this. So
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.040]   the book is Brian Tracy's "Eat That Frog." For me, it's a five star. Definitely a must
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.240]   buy. Don't expect it to be long. Don't expect it to be in depth. But if you like the concept
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.560]   of that overview, this will be a useful book for you. I'll put a link to my Audible affiliate
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   link in the description box. So if you'd like to sign up for Audible, you get two free e-books
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.200]   with that. This is again, I think this is definitely a must own book. So this would
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.560]   be a good one to buy, an audio book version, or I'll put a link to the paper book or the
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.160]   Kindle book on Amazon as well in the description. Thanks for watching.
