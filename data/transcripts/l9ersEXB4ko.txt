[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.200]   series live video event. The idea.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.240]   for a live online event came about.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.400]   after COVID-19 led to the cancellation of.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.840]   the 2020 Bogleheads conference, which.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.880]   would have been held in October.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.840]   As a matter of record, the board is.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.200]   talking about resuming the conference in.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.080]   2022.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.920]   In the meantime, we bring you this live speaker.

[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.840]   could not be more excited to introduce Carl Richards. He's.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.040]   joining us from London where he lives. It's already Saturday night.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.080]   there. Carl specializes in conveying.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.120]   sophisticated financial concepts in an.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.360]   easy to understand way, specifically using a Sharpie.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.400]   He is a certified financial planner and he's creator.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.680]   of the sketch guy column in the New York Times. He's also author.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.960]   of a couple of books, the one page financial plan.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.120]   a simple way to be smart about your money in the behavior.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.480]   gap. Simple ways to stop doing dumb things with money.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.720]   He also did the wonderful sketches for a book that just came out.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.760]   that I've made a contribution to called how I invest my.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.880]   money. Carl, welcome to the Boglehead speaker.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.960]   series. We're excited to have you here and I'm even more excited.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.000]   because I found out that you may be able to sketch a little bit.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.960]   for us today.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   Christine, it's an honor to be here and Rick and the whole board.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   thank you for giving me the opportunity with just a pleasure.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   I've always thought really highly of this group.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.240]   of people, so excited to be here. Well, thanks for donating.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.760]   your time. Wanted to start by asking about your particular.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.840]   focus for people who might not be familiar. You're.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   a CFP, a certified financial planner, so you're certainly.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.960]   very knowledgeable about matters of asset allocation and tax.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.000]   planning. But over the past decade or so, you've gotten more.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.320]   interested in what we might call sort of financial.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.400]   life planning. And let's talk about what.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.440]   that is. What why you're so enthused?
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.000]   about this idea of helping people align their financial plans?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.040]   with their bigger life goals. What kind of?
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.240]   set you on this journey?
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.040]   Yeah, I so.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.440]   I think it was just repeated so.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.600]   20 whatever 2223 years ago when I started.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.640]   in this sort of financial industry speaking.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.480]   broadly.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   I got into the.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.960]   Industry quite by accident, sort.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.680]   of. I applied to be a security guard thinking.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.200]   that the ad said I didn't realize the ad said securities.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.480]   instead of security and I didn't know the difference at.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.400]   the time. This is right during when I was at university and.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.880]   it was in the late 90s, right? And there's a lot of exciting.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.280]   things going on in the late 90s and so.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.600]   after I got over the fact that I wasn't a security guard I.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.760]   was on the phone at a big call center.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.920]   actually at Fidelity Investments, one of their big call centers at the.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.000]   time it was their national call center in Salt Lake and.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.320]   answering phones.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.720]   And.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.520]   I just remember being struck for that. I mean.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.720]   it was years. I remember just being sort of like unmoored.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.560]   a bit about this.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.880]   sense of it wasn't about spreadsheets.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.920]   and calculators, right? I couldn't put words to it, but I was like.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.800]   I didn't expect it to be so emotional. I didn't expect. I was like, wait, this is.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.040]   spreadsheets and calculators, isn't it? And it turns out it's not.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.240]   And then I spent a.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.400]   decade and a half sort of working with individual clients.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   and seeing this repeated pattern.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.920]   of what we think our job.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.000]   is as investors.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and then even if you want to take it one step further.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.040]   that we think what the industry thinks his job is.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.360]   to provide products.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.280]   And I just saw this repeated.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.320]   focus on maybe the best comparison is whether.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.440]   I should take a plane arguing and researching about whether I should take.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.000]   a plane, a train, or an automobile on a trip.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.800]   Before we had decided where we were going to go.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.680]   And this idea of deciding where you want to go right like.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.200]   that to me, we can build the best asset allocation.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.680]   ever created by the mind of man smartest the.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.920]   most research back the most evidence based the most.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.400]   inexpensive. We can do all of those things, but.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.520]   if it doesn't get us where we want to go, what's the point? And.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.440]   as this group knows really well, like one behavioral mistake will blow.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.880]   the whole thing up anyway, so we can't get the behavior right.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.960]   and we can't get the underlying sort of I'll.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.040]   use the term goals very loosely, but if we can't get the underlying.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.280]   goals right, we sort of wake up and we're seeing this all.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.360]   over the world. People are waking up and saying.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   What was it all for?
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.000]   You know what? Is this really what I wanted and?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.400]   so I think.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.240]   The idea of spending some time getting clear about why.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.600]   we're doing it in the first place has become.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.760]   to me, everything else feels like hacking at the branches.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.800]   that we can make marginal improvements. But until we.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.960]   get that right, or at least until we start guessing.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.880]   at that, we're never going to get it right, but until we start guessing.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.280]   at that, the rest sort of.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.680]   loses its importance. That's really how I started focusing.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.400]   on that, so let's talk about this. I think.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.440]   you probably know this group of bogal heads. We've got a group of.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.600]   people who are really good at the spreadsheet.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.880]   and calculator piece and how about?
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.400]   how can we talk about how we get better at the?
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.480]   other piece of it at articulating our goals and our?
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.560]   vision for our lives? What are the questions that we should be asking?
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.200]   ourselves?
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.240]   Yeah, that's a really good question. I mean, I think the first thing we need to do is sort of realize.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.440]   like there's this sort of movement that I guess.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.720]   people call life planning and I've never really never resonated.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.160]   a lot with me simply because life.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.480]   planning to me feels and goal based planning feels.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.520]   like oxygen based breathing.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.640]   Right, like of course you should have goals for what.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.960]   you're doing right? So I think the.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.360]   first thing is just to say look, this isn't about crying on the couch.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.400]   It's not about therapy. It's not about.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.800]   getting becoming one with yourself. It's just simply.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.000]   about saying look the purpose.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.960]   Of financial planning and I'm using that.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.160]   term broadly is to align.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.840]   your use of capital with what's important.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.520]   to you.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.400]   OK, and obviously as you mentioned this group.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.680]   understands once like once.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.720]   we need to deploy capital, we understand at least the.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.360]   process of figuring out how to do it in a sophisticated.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.880]   way.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.480]   So the question becomes how do we align that?
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.320]   What we're so good at.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.160]   With what's important to us and it starts.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.240]   by. I mean, I just didn't. I didn't realize I don't.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.280]   know why I didn't realize how hard that is for us.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.280]   to get clear about what's important to us.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.320]   We're not used to thinking about it. We're not used.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.400]   to having an idea of like look.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.680]   And part of the reason is mimetic were so.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.720]   caught up in mimetic desire, right? Like looking we don't.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.600]   know how we don't even know how to know what we want.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.160]   What we know is to look at what other.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   people do.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.920]   Right, and take our clues from them, and this is only gotten harder with.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.080]   sort of the Instagram lives. So many of us are trying.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.160]   to keep up with. It's really hard to get clear, and so I.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160]   think the way to think through this is.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.200]   just to take the time like where do you?
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.240]   want to go?
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.840]   What's important to you? I love the idea of.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.000]   the calendar and the checkbook never lie.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.880]   Right, so I don't. I don't really care what.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.920]   you say is important to you. Christine, show me your calendar.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.960]   in your checkbook and I'll tell you what's important.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.360]   to you.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.080]   So this idea if I were to draw.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.120]   it and maybe we should have our first experiment.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.640]   here. If I were.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.560]   let me just connect this real quick. I'll.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.360]   connect my iPad to the screen.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.440]   There we go now. Let me share it if I were to.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.400]   Here we go. Tell me Christine, can you see that?
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.680]   I yes, I can.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.360]   see it. OK, I assume our audience can as well perfect.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.560]   Well, I'll just I'll look for it 'cause I can see you.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.880]   So if you give me some clue that it's not working, I'll stop.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.920]   So let's just think about.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.240]   let's just use a word like values.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.880]   I think you could substitute a lot of words like what's.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.440]   important to me values. I love purpose.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.680]   I love the idea of purpose and.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.440]   if we.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.040]   But if we had a set of values and then we.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.080]   looked at and we'll talk if it's OK, we can talk.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.160]   for a minute about how do we even get clear about this, but if we.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.920]   then looked at how we.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.480]   use our money and our time.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.880]   And we'll just call those actions. Often there's a gap.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.160]   here and that gap is called.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:25.960]   being a human.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.080]   Right, like and it's really it's really.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.200]   this gap here is.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.440]   Is really painful, actually.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.320]   Right when you wake up and say gosh, I spent all that time.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.120]   At the office, I could have spent more time with the kids or I.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.360]   we've got plenty of money, but we never.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.760]   enjoyed it or you hear these things constantly.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.800]   like I can't remember the name of the book, but it was the.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.000]   palliative care nurse, the nurse at the end of life nurse.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.880]   that took care of so many people, and she wrote that book about what their.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.960]   common regrets were, and it was always like.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.040]   it was always the things they hadn't done. There was very few.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.480]   regrets about stuff they had. People didn't really remember the mistakes.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.520]   they'd made. They remembered the things they hadn't done, and so there's this.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.560]   often this gap between what we say is important to us and what.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.680]   we're actually doing with our time and money and.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.760]   so I just am hopeful that we can.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.000]   that we can somehow get that those.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.800]   circles just can.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.680]   we start.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.840]   To see some of this overlap and wouldn't it be amazing.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.480]   if that was a Venn diagram?
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.440]   Right where there was perfect overlap. I mean, I had that once Christmas.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.640]   Eve. I remember right the kids.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.720]   sitting on the couch. The snow is falling. The dog was there doing.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.800]   the thing and then the next morning. Of course we woke up.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.640]   and all the presence and I was like who bought all these presents and what happened.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.760]   with the budget like so we just serve. We just.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.840]   end up circling back and forth between these ideas.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.000]   like OK, we get some overlap and then we end.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.040]   up back here where there's a gap. So how do we?
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.200]   get clear?
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.160]   About the values piece, I'm going to stop this share for second.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.240]   How do we get clear?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.600]   about the values piece?
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.520]   Have I stopped my share?
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.560]   Yes, no, I'm still seeing it, but you're still.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.880]   saying OK, alright here. I think I just did this. There we go.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.120]   And that's just.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.360]   a function of taking time to ask ourselves.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.520]   and to start noticing right? What?
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.080]   are the things that really? And there's so much research around.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.400]   and hopefully this group is familiar with it around what?
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.280]   really brings happiness as it relates to our use of money.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.440]   Right? That experiences with people we love.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.440]   And even there we know that the anticipation of the experience.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.480]   is somewhere between 40 and 60% of the.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.520]   enjoyment we get out of the experience. So there's so much we.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.760]   can do. What was her Elizabeth? It's not Elizabeth.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.720]   Gilbert. Maybe it's not Elizabeth Gilbert. Elizabeth done Elizabeth Dunn's.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.800]   book on it. She says if you don't think money.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.080]   can buy happiness, it's 'cause you don't know how to spend it.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.360]   Right, and so just getting a little more clear about the things that.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.200]   bring us.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.320]   I assume the goal of money.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.160]   Beyond freedom stability, I assume the goal of money is let's.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.520]   call this thing happiness.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.320]   Well, we know a little bit about how we.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.240]   can use that and often how we.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.200]   can use money to bring happiness and often it relates.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.400]   to fulfilling our values and Simon cynics work on start.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.720]   with why so that's to me. That's a really long winded answer.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.520]   to your question of how do we get clear? We start thinking about it.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.640]   We start thinking about it, right? And I think right.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.240]   now.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.560]   Right, this is like 2008 and 2009. I remember.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.680]   people having conversations that they I just had never.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.680]   heard before. I remember hearing him at the coffee shop.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.080]   overhearing people talk about what's important to them.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.120]   Who do they trust? Right now we've been given.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.160]   permission in no way that I can ever remember.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.320]   to really be questioning those things. I mean.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.000]   assuming we have a little bit of stability to have.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.120]   those conversations and granted lots of us don't.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.480]   right, but if we do a number of us have been giving permission.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.600]   to ask those questions like who do we trust? What's?
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.640]   important to us? How do I really want to be spending our time in a way?
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.920]   that we've never had before?
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.760]   So yeah, so hopefully that helps it.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.960]   does. It does. I want to ask about the pandemic because you're.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.120]   right. I think many of us are thinking big picture.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.160]   thoughts about our lives and the trajectory of our lives and what we're.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.600]   doing. I guess the question is, is this a good?
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.080]   time to be making big life altering decisions?
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.280]   I mean, there are some things about what we're going through that are a little bit.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.320]   traumatic. I just wonder, you always hear like.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.360]   after the death of someone not to make any.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.400]   big changes. How about right now? Is this a good time?
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.520]   to decide to relocate or change jobs or whatever?
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.200]   it might be?
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.840]   Yeah, that might be slightly beyond my.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.040]   pay grade, but my sense is.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.080]   that now is a really good time to be noticing.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.840]   Right, taking note recording.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.040]   thinking, journaling, right? Like understanding now.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.200]   and I also sense is that it made it obviously.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.920]   totally varies by your situation.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.240]   Right, if you there are some of us that have been massively.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.320]   impacted by this.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.920]   Right, and there's others that financially.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.160]   or whatever their situation allows them a little bit. If you've got the freedom.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.520]   and flexibility to be making some of those decisions, right?
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.880]   but my sense is right now is a really good time to be noticing.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.360]   And asking questions and deciding like.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.480]   what do I really want and then aligning?
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.960]   Your portfolio and your.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.520]   use of capital with what you said.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.520]   what you notice, right?
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.120]   Wanted to read you a question from one of our attendees he.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.200]   wrote. He or she wrote in your book, the behavior.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.640]   gap. You said that financial decisions are about getting happy and.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.280]   if there is a secret to getting happy, it's this be true to yourself.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.680]   So that's great advice, but one must.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.080]   first know oneself. How would you advise investors to go?
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.480]   about knowing themselves?
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:26.160]   Yeah, this is the huge problem I thought.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.280]   I didn't realize I was opening such a huge can of worms.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.360]   for myself 15 years ago when I started thinking about this stuff.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.400]   'cause like it's really challenging like.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.440]   when we say align your use of capital with what?
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.080]   is important to us.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.800]   Getting clear about what's important to you is really.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.000]   really hard. I mean, we know a little bit about happiness and money.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.720]   right? Like we talked about a minute ago. We know that spending money on experiences.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.480]   with people you love is far more enduring.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.200]   than buying stuff.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.320]   Right, we know that above a certain income.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.760]   level and not more income doesn't necessarily add.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.000]   exponentially, certainly not to our happiness.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.520]   So we know a few of those things, but what we don't know is.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.720]   do you enjoy spending time?
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.760]   at the museum and I enjoy spending time.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.840]   on a river.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.880]   Right, and so understanding and let me give you an example.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.040]   We used to go to movies with friends.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.600]   It seemed like the thing you do.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.880]   You would meet, maybe have a quick dinner.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.920]   and then go to a movie and.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.520]   the purpose of the evening.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.560]   together was to spend time together.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.360]   And then we'd go to a movie where we spent no time together. I mean.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.560]   we were sitting next to each other, but we said and so one time we noticed.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.840]   we were like, well, wait, what if we?
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.640]   What if we invited a couple over to our?
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.680]   house and we're not cooks? We have no.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.720]   I mean, we barely know how to cook anything, but what if we invited?
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.120]   a couple over? We made a simple meal together.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   Like we made it together, we spent two or three hours.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.600]   doing that.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.800]   Rather than going to the movie, well.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.080]   every time we did that, it brought I don't know what the.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.440]   right multiple would be, but it's at least two.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.640]   maybe 10 times more enjoyment than going to the movie.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.120]   Let me give you one more example. I had a friend. His name was Rob.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.480]   And so here's the process we used to take people through so.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.880]   we would just say, look, track your spending.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   And everybody loves this. Tracking their spending is everybody's favorite thing, but actually.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.080]   this group might actually do it. Track your spending.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.840]   but just add one thing.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.600]   So I would just go through every transaction and say.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.400]   is this aligned with what I said was.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.440]   important to me or not?
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.160]   And you get a gimme on all utilities, right? You don't.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.520]   have to think through as the power bill aligned right.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.840]   but all discretionary spending at the very.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.280]   least discretionary spending at least is it aligned or not if.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.400]   it's aligned.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.280]   We used to just make a note of what was the value that it.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.480]   was aligned with, and so my friend Rob did this.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.680]   and he noticed that he had a friend that he met every.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.800]   month for lunch and he would pay for lunch.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.960]   And this let's just say it was $35.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.560]   or something.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.920]   Rob noticed OK, what's the value? The value is friendship.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.280]   Well, this friend had been going through a couple of years of really.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.320]   tough times, didn't have a lot of other people to talk to, and.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.440]   so Rob was like that's aligned completely aligned.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.600]   But then the next step was is.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.720]   there another way?
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.360]   Right, would there be another way to align that align?
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.280]   my use of time and money with that value of friendship?
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.880]   And Rob was like, well, geez, we both really like to walk.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.920]   or hike and we both work at.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.160]   a specific university that's right at the foothills.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.760]   of a bunch of really amazing mountains.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.520]   So he said, look, what if we just met the next month?
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.680]   He suggested let's just meet and go for a walk.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   And Rob called me so excited 'cause he was like look.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.800]   and what Rob did every month with that money he would use.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.120]   so he took that $35 and he automatically upped his auto.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.200]   investment into the S&P 500 index fund and I'm.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.960]   not making that story up just because of the audience, but it's actually.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.440]   what he did. So every month. So now he was like, look, I've got $35.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.720]   more going in towards a.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.200]   vehicle that's going to express some other value.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.360]   And I'm spending more time with my friend.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.440]   And so those are those like yes and yes.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.520]   Decisions where we can get granular on just noticing.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.520]   like turns out I don't enjoy that one last.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.680]   one. A friend of mine who was just beating.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.240]   himself up, beating himself up for eating out so often.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.120]   And the most ironic part about this is this friend of mine.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.320]   wrote one of the most popular.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.240]   in New York Times bestselling food books.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.240]   of the last 10 years and I pointed out to him like wait.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.280]   You love eating out.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.560]   It was like, well, yeah, but I shouldn't. I'm like who says you shouldn't.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.640]   So the idea of looking for all the way.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.840]   down to the budgetary level, like the spending level and.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.400]   then we can talk if we want to about how aligning that use in our investments.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.800]   but looking for ways to be cut ruthlessly.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.960]   on things that don't bring us value and.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.240]   spend extravagantly on things that do and the only way.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.600]   to sort through that. Unfortunately, there's no rule of thumb. There's.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.840]   no app for it, right? And it's the only way to sort.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.880]   through that is to make a small bet.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.440]   Hey, let's try this. I think I like going to the museum.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.480]   Oh, I didn't enjoy that as much as I thought I would. Let's try.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.240]   make small bets and notice where tailwind shows up and.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.000]   keep track, right? So that's.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.720]   Only way to do it. Unfortunately, there's no shortcut.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:04.320]   You really live this experience that you urge people to go through the process.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.480]   of pushing themselves to try out new ideas.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.520]   or take small bets as you put it and.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.160]   try out experiences that they think might contribute to a fuller.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.240]   and more fully realized life. Can you talk a little bit about?
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.600]   your personal experience? You're in London, as we said at the outset.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.040]   but it's not been a straight trajectory. You were in Utah.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.200]   You were in Australia, I believe. So can you talk about?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.240]   how you kind of pushed yourself in the direction that?
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.360]   in on the path that you're on now?
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.920]   Yeah, and I should tell you I'm not sure this is.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.760]   a good idea for anybody, right?
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.520]   And this is part of the problem is we all are looking.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.600]   for models on how to do things.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.240]   or templates, but.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.520]   we were thrilled living.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.840]   in Park City, Utah, which is sort of where I was.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.160]   I lived there when I was younger until I was about 8, so it's sort of home.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.520]   to me. The Wasatch Mountains, right? Even the smell.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.560]   of the Wasatch. I can feel it now, right? Like I love the place.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.240]   Happily there and then we.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.600]   but we had always talked about living overseas and.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.840]   my wife particularly always wanted the experience and an.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.240]   opportunity came up and by opportunity came up. I just mean a window.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.280]   opened. There was no like job opportunity there were like we.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.640]   had to make this happen.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.880]   And it's a very long story, but I'll cut it short to go to New Zealand.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.160]   like somebody. See all that happened with somebody suggested.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.280]   it to my wife at yoga and we make all of our major.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.600]   financial decisions based on my wife's experience at yoga, right?
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.640]   So somebody suggested and we had a little window. It was.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.760]   because we needed to move from one house to another. That was the.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.160]   window was like, hey, we're moving anyway, why not?
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.160]   move to New Zealand? So we went.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.200]   to New Zealand for a year and stayed for three.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.520]   and a half because it was just it was amazing.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.880]   Now I'm we've got we.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.360]   have the flexibility because my work is location.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.320]   independent.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.960]   But we didn't do this. I just want to be.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.000]   clear, right? Like 'cause I get this question all the time like wouldn't.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.920]   it be nice we this was that we.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.960]   decided to value experiences.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.160]   with our kids over security.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.600]   And it was uncomfortable financially.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.680]   like I are we really doing this? Are we really sure we should do?
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.160]   this? Because it wasn't the stable.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.320]   thing to do, so we went to New Zealand and.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.640]   it was worth every cent like I wouldn't.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.720]   I mean, it costs way more than we thought it was going to cost because things.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.400]   come up.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.120]   He says and all these things that you don't expect.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.720]   But it was worth it.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.440]   I would do it over again 100. I would do it over again.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.640]   100 out of 100 chances, right? And then we're in New Zealand.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.280]   And.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.080]   Enjoying it and my wife had.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.280]   always wanted to go to interior design school.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.400]   And she had spent 24.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.640]   years at that point, sort of delaying.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.960]   all the things she wanted to do to be heavily involved.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.040]   in the massive amount of work of running a household with 4.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.600]   kids.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.560]   And so we were sort of like, hey, you should apply to this school and she.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.680]   found this school in London and we sort of didn't think.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.960]   it would happen immediately. She applied.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.080]   in June, I believe.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.880]   Got accepted and school started in September, so she.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.720]   was like, well, I'll delay for a year.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.920]   And the family sort of looked at her and said, no, you've been delaying.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.240]   for a long time for the rest of us. Like let's go.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.320]   so that's we moved. We moved to London, got here. She came in September.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.360]   We got here in January, just in time to really want to be.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.440]   back in New Zealand, but it's been.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.800]   amazing. So yeah, that's what's happened here and we don't know.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.840]   and this is interesting to me and I think might be.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.920]   useful to all of you.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.480]   I think one of the big lessons of the last 11.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.600]   months, 10 months has been that.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.240]   Uncertainty is reality.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.880]   Right, it always has been.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.480]   We just have gotten sort of a stark reminder.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.360]   Of it, and so these plans we make.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.600]   our guesses and it's OK.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.640]   right? Like, but life never goes if you.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.680]   think life goes according to plan, just go.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.640]   back and look at your goals that you wrote out in January of.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.880]   2020.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.080]   And tell me if any of them went the way you thought.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.440]   I mean, none of us saw this coming, and so.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.680]   I think making plans is good.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.000]   In fact, I know it is making plans is good because.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.040]   it gives us a baseline. It's a little bit like a flight plan in a.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.240]   plane, right? Every good pilot.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.760]   makes a detailed flight plan, but if you ask.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.960]   every pilot I've ever asked, how often does the.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.040]   plan go? How often does the flight go according to plan? They'll tell you.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.080]   the honest truth, which is never right. It's always slightly.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.120]   different, so I think we've gotten a real reminder of.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.240]   that and I think that's I.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.680]   think that's it's really unsettling, but it's true.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.720]   Right that life is uncertain markets.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.840]   are uncertain. The biggest risk is the one.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.720]   we've never thought about and can't.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.640]   Think about right and so planning.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.720]   in that environment forces us to accept this.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.840]   reality that things are temperate. Sorry things.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.880]   are temporary. There is no permanence and then.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.480]   once we accept that.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.320]   Right, things get a little easier to navigate 'cause.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.480]   we're not attached.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.640]   To this idea of what we've stored up in the barn being.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.160]   there exactly the place we put it when we go back, right?
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.760]   One concept that you've talked about, you talk about quite a bit.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.360]   and you've got a great sketch on this topic is the idea of enough.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.520]   and Jack Bobo wrote a book called enough where he.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.800]   explored that idea as well. Can you?
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.960]   take us through that exercise? How we can all figure out our?
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.120]   own personal sense of what's enough?
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.920]   Yeah, again, excuse me again. Such a good question.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.000]   This, by the way, is why I said yes to this.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.040]   opportunity is because I get to chat with you and you're always.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.680]   so thoughtful. So thank you.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.960]   I don't know I don't I don't.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.160]   know how to figure this out.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.520]   In fact, it's funny. I literally I do a lot of my work.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.600]   while walking and just thinking.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.720]   about things and then calling a short list.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.840]   of people way smarter than I mean, there's a lot of people way.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.520]   smarter than me. I just happen to have the phone numbers are very short list and.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.560]   last week I was having this conversation with Morgan Housel. I called him.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.920]   specifically and said, hey, how do you think about enough and another?
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.560]   friend of mine, Greg Davies, who's a real finance.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.400]   guy here in London.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.480]   I think to me and I've spent it.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.320]   I'm not exaggerating when I say I spent a decade thinking about enough.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.360]   And I love that old. I believe.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.600]   it was Kurt Vonnegut in that conversation that where.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.960]   he said they're at a party that a hedge fund manager.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   through and somebody's Kurt said to somebody else.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.880]   How does it feel to know that he makes more and camera?
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.160]   the details, but it's like how does it feel that he makes more in one day?
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.080]   than you'll make in your whole life and whoever it was that.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.160]   Kurt Vonnegut was talking to you said, well, I have something he'll never have, which.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.880]   is enough.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.960]   And.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.040]   To me, after thinking about a decade, the only.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.320]   answer I have is we just have to think about it right like we.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.360]   just I think.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.880]   The real answers to all.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.240]   of these questions, personal finance questions, budgeting questions.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.360]   even investing questions. Really, we need to.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.480]   get more in tune with awareness.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.720]   Right, then we do a spreadsheet.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.880]   And all those spreadsheet tools are really valuable.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.160]   and there may be. There's probably some way to spend some time around.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.440]   the budget and you're spending to sort of sort out what enough might.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.160]   be in, but I think.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.400]   Those those represent the messy middle to me.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.680]   right? Like looking at the spreadsheet calculating.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.520]   seeing how much we spend seeing how much we need projecting it out at a 4% withdrawal.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.720]   rate and using some Monte Carlo tool like that to me represents the messy.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.000]   middle really important looking at other people's examples. It's a little bit.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.600]   like reading reviews of a pair of tennis shoes on Amazon.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.680]   If you go read 50 reviews of the shoes you're thinking of buying.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.760]   you don't leave with more clarity you leave.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.920]   more confused, right? But maybe it's supposed to be.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.320]   that way that represents the messy middle considering the nuance.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.520]   the edge cases. This is what I do with the sketches, right? I go into.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.560]   a problem like enough and I have conversations for 10.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.440]   years and at some point hopefully I'll pop.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.600]   out the other side. Jack. So Bogle said.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.760]   sometimes to get to simplicity, you've got to cut through the SWAT.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.720]   the huge. I think he used the word cut through huge swaths.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.600]   of complexity.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.800]   And I think it's the same thing with this idea of enough like just.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.480]   pay attention. Notice that I thought.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.600]   that car would be really valuable to me.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.760]   or I thought that vacation or I thought that house.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.800]   or I thought once I had a $1,000,000 in my.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.920]   beautifully elegantly designed passive portfolio I.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.000]   would feel something. Well, it turns out I didn't.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.080]   or I did and there's no right or wrong.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.200]   answer to it. So to me it all comes down.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.920]   to just can we just start having this conversation?
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.440]   And not feeling like it's too California or.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.480]   too new age or some fuzzy thing like can we just?
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.960]   start noticing and.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.200]   I think this is where we've gone off track with money is nobody.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.360]   taught us to talk about it in the first place and if they did.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.520]   teach us to talk about it, they taught us in that it was a math.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.080]   problem.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.720]   And then when we go to touch it.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.920]   Every time we go to touch it, it reminds me of a electric.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.040]   fence that you don't know is electric. I mean, if you've ever.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.280]   had that experience, I actually have and I've got my wife was recording.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.080]   it. I was I was. We're in we're in France.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.320]   and we're on a mountain bike ride and there was this wire and I'd never.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.480]   seen it. I mean, I'm from the West. We have barbed.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.680]   wire. We don't have and I brushed my leg.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.920]   up against it was like cool. Well, that was weird and I thought is that an electric fence?
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.840]   while recording? I reached out and grabbed it.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:48.600]   But that's what it reminds me when we talk about or we touch these topics.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.280]   around money.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   Is oh, I didn't expect that to be emotional.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.960]   I thought this fit in a spreadsheet.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.000]   That's all I was ever taught and you're like wow turns.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.280]   out this isn't about well, it is also about spreadsheets.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.560]   but it turns out this is really about fear and.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.600]   worry. It's the stuff that keeps us up at night. The stuff sometimes it.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.760]   wakes us up in the morning and so the answer.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.000]   to the question around enough is can we just give ourselves?
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.120]   permission to have this conversation?
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.800]   Can we just?
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.800]   Pay attention a little bit.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.280]   We just think about it like that's where this will all start.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:31.680]   I want to talk about this behavior gap concept and.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.960]   I suspect a lot of people watching will be familiar with the most.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.000]   common behavior gap that investors think about.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.320]   which is that you've got this well laid investment.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.400]   plan that you completely up in during times of market.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.440]   turbulence. Do you think that that is?
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.880]   maybe over discussed at the expense of other behavioral?
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.760]   gaps that might go on in our lives?
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:58.960]   That's a such a good question. Over discussed I.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.080]   know that I for a maybe year.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.600]   or two. I sort of got frustrated with the amount.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.760]   of times people wanted to talk about that one and.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.200]   really, it's investment return compared to investor.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.360]   return and this audience will be totally familiar with.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.440]   it and particularly the work even done at Morningstar.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.320]   where you've got for the same fund right?
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.320]   The investment and we could just use time weighted rates.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.240]   of return versus dollar weighted rates of return for this audience, right?
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.520]   That was where the behavior app originally.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.760]   was sort of named.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.040]   And it's what people often.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.080]   want to talk about because investments are what we talk about.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.960]   So I got a little sort of I don't know, tired of it.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.960]   and then I realized it's actually just kind of.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.000]   a righteous trick, right? It's just it's a Trojan horse.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   It's an opportunity to get into a conversation that's more.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.040]   important. So yeah, I think it's over discussed, but.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.080]   I also think at least we're talking about it, right?
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.440]   At least we're starting to understand the importance of behavior.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.480]   and at least we're having these conversations.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.520]   20 years on now, at least we're talking about it a lot.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.320]   What are some of the other behavior gaps that you've observed?
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.920]   Yeah, so.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.240]   So you could go through all the behavioral finance.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.240]   stuff and notice things like I think.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.800]   I think clearly we've already talked about the other one that I'm most interested.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.640]   in, which is just when we're not aligning.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.800]   I have made a habit.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.480]   of asking people when they find out what I do.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.800]   it gives me permission to ask questions. So like on a plane.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.720]   or whatever, right?
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.280]   To ask people why is your money invested the way?
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.320]   it is? So I don't know how many times I've asked that.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.920]   question, but I know it's hundreds, if not thousands of times now and.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.960]   the most common question I get, I'm sorry, the most common.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.280]   answer I get. I mean, let me tell you, I've never gotten.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.280]   What I consider to be the only right answer, which is.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.320]   this port. I built this portfolio because it gives.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.480]   me the greatest likelihood of meeting my goals. I've never had anybody actually.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.560]   say that out loud and this audience that might just be like, come on seriously.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.680]   you've never right. What I often get is I read.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   about it in the newspaper and I saw it in the news.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.800]   My buddy at my buddy at the club told me about like that's.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.000]   how and the really smart people whisper carefully.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.040]   they say I read about it in The Economist, right like.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.280]   the super smart ones. So that's a big.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.080]   gap is not.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.600]   thinking through. I did a bunch of institutional consulting and.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.040]   even in the institutional consulting space like huge university.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.000]   endowments where we'd have this conversation.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.080]   and in a university endowment setting the right.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.280]   answer to why is the money invested the way it is should.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.320]   be because this portfolio gives us the greatest likelihood of.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.640]   meeting our spending policy.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.680]   Right, it never was. It was always.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.080]   like, well, we got a two inch thick book from XYZ.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.080]   firm telling us what some super smart person.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.120]   came in and bought a steak dinners and talk to us about this. It's always.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.440]   these crazy things, so I think that's another gap is not aligning.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.520]   our portfolio with the.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.760]   goals and like one last one last.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.160]   story about this. A friend of mine named Jeff, a retired.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.560]   investment banker, had a big pool of money when he retired.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.840]   enough that he could get him to see the best financial.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.760]   quote unquote financial people in the world.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.200]   He had met with five different firms, all of which you would recognize.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.280]   This was this is actually the New Year's Eve party.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.360]   He pulled me aside like I've got to talk to you. He tells me he's like I've met.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.680]   with five different firms and not one of them yet.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:47.400]   Not one of them has aligned the portfolio they're suggesting.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.560]   To my goals and I was like what are you talking?
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.720]   about? Like, what are they aligning to? And they're like, well, they're aligning it to their.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.240]   tactical asset allocation model or their forecast.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.480]   of what's going to come or their chief investment strategist.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.040]   and that's all great.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.160]   Except that that's not the reason we invest the money.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.680]   right? So that's another big gap. I'm not one more.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.080]   well spending. We've already talked a little bit about one.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.280]   of the big big mistakes I see and I.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.320]   think I'm going to be if I can't. I'll just be a little.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.080]   direct because I think this group.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   Probably is prone to this mistake.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.960]   Is over confidence and here's the reason.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.000]   I think you're prone to it over confidence.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.080]   is a problem of experts.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.680]   Right over confidence is what you get when.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.800]   experts behave exactly the way you would expect.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.920]   experts to behave.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.240]   That's why it's so tricky. I don't have a solution other.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.400]   than well. Here's a little exercise anytime.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.520]   you're thinking and the reason I think and hopefully.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:59.040]   the fact that you're prone to this comes across as a compliment.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.920]   right? Like you're experts.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.680]   And over confidence is what we get when experts.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.800]   behave exactly like experts are supposed to behave.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.680]   So here's a little exercise before.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.320]   the next the next.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.480]   Before you go to make any change to the portfolio.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.520]   because you're convinced something is going to change or whatever.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.800]   that is, you read something on the interwebs and.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.000]   you've decided that there's some change you need to make. There's.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.880]   a conversation that I like to go through with myself and.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.920]   other people called the over confidence conversation and you.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.760]   just simply ask what.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.800]   If you're right and you make this change, how.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.120]   would your life be different? So there's three questions. If you're right and.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.400]   you make this change, how would your life be different? Normally the answer.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.440]   to that question is sort of marginally, right? Like it's.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.280]   around the edges. I might take an extra vacation. Maybe I could retire a year earlier.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.920]   like even if it's like a big bet, it's.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.960]   not like I'm suddenly going to have an airplane normally 'cause.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.040]   we're not talking massive bets. So if you were right, how would your life?
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.280]   be different? Question number two, if you're wrong.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.840]   You do this thing and you're wrong. How would you like to be different? Often the.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.800]   answer to that question is like, oh geez, I mean, you know.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.240]   what I mean? Like I might be in trouble at home. I.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.320]   also might have to work five more years.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.200]   like it normally and part of that's playing into this.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.400]   idea that we feel the pain of loss far.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.600]   greater than we do the pleasure of gain. But so and.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.800]   then the third question is and this is hard to ask people.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.520]   but have you ever been wrong before?
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.640]   Right, and so if you can just get yourself in the mindset.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.440]   of like well.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.880]   That's the only the only hint I have for dealing with overconfidence.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.880]   is to just.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.920]   Remind yourself of times when you were.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.600]   so sure before.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.480]   And you turned out to be wrong and we reason.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.920]   is so hard is we're so good at weaving.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.880]   narratives.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.400]   About.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.200]   Our skill when maybe it.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.440]   was luck or about our bad.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.880]   luck when maybe it was a poor decision right?
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.840]   to suit our own story and if we again.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.000]   it all comes back to awareness, we can just be honest and clear.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.880]   eyed about the decisions we've made.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:23.600]   Would you say extended bull markets like the one we've had?
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.640]   tend to give rise to more overconfidence? Does it?
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.840]   relate it to what's happened in the market? Yeah, I think.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.200]   I mean, that's another. If we can do.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.280]   this real quick, I'll just.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   see how quick this goes. I think if I just.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.400]   hit share, it might still be there.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.760]   So can you see that now?
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:52.480]   Just about, yep, yeah, so the.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.680]   there's another challenge when we have extended markets either.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.720]   direction and this recency bias problem is.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.800]   a big deal, right? And so whenever this.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.040]   is going on.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.720]   What we expect?
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.720]   So recency bias is just taking the recent past.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.040]   and projecting it indefinitely into the future, right?
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.160]   So what we expect is this to happen.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.160]   And even if it's not on the same trajectory, we're expecting.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.720]   something like this to happen.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.040]   And often what does happen is right like expectations.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.920]   versus reality and so.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.640]   yes, I think what happens in extended.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.760]   extended pull markets or we just get.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.040]   we start to forget what.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.920]   it means, what risk means.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.200]   We stay say things like.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.920]   Risk, what risk?
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.240]   And we I.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.520]   can't tell you the and we do the same thing in a bear market.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.040]   right? Obviously, and the challenge we have these days is.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.360]   our definition of the recent past has.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.360]   shortened, it used to be. Maybe we.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.560]   would talk in years. Now we're often talking.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.360]   in days. I once made a chart of.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.080]   All the apocalypse du jour's that we went.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.320]   through. I think it was in 2016. I can't remember which what it was.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   but it was just like every day and then it was.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.440]   gone, right? Like in the news all day long for.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.440]   like three days and then gone like not a mention of.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.680]   it. And so when things are going.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.720]   up, we tend to forget risk is.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.920]   so easy to forget, right? It's an arbitrary concept.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.440]   until you experience it and all the lifeboat.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.680]   drills like talking about getting punched in the face is different than.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.120]   getting punched in the face.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.120]   And so when we when we've forgotten.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.280]   you know, bull market, bull market, bull market, we start to say things like.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.400]   yeah, I think I'd be comfortable with that 6040.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.040]   portfolio moving into 8020.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:04.440]   You know what I've heard of people that are 100% equity.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.920]   What's wrong, right? We're not making those most.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.120]   of us. Now this group may be different. I'm hoping this group is different, right?
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.480]   But most of us are not wired to make a decision.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.560]   to go deeper, increase our equity.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.160]   allocation when things are scary.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.920]   Right, and there's all those reasons like we are wired as herd animals.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.080]   were looking around. Stay safe, everybody else is doing it.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.240]   It feels safe staying in the herd, right?
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.480]   We equate leaving the herd to being killed, you.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.760]   know. So I think recency bias is a huge problem.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.800]   and the only way I know to solve recency bias is again to.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.080]   expand your definition of the recent past to.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.520]   look back. The good news about investing is it leaves a breadcrumb.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.040]   trail.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.920]   Investing behavior, right? How did you behave?
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.560]   in 2008 nine?
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:57.680]   You know if you can go back, what were you doing in 99 2000?
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.600]   2001?
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:03.080]   Notice the behavior and like I've noticed for.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.680]   myself, I'm terrible at it.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.600]   Terrible, which is why I have a great financial planner that I.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   literally don't want to know anything about it. I just want to throw the money.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.800]   over the wall. Do not talk to me about it. I'm really.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.440]   good at giving other people advice terrible.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.640]   at taking my own.
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.440]   And so I think we need to understand that some.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.520]   of us are hardwired that way, right? So yeah, the reason recent past is.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.120]   a challenge.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:31.720]   Speaking of thinking back to how we thought.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:35.240]   during bad market environments like 2008.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.840]   we're all 12 years older, so I guess the question.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:42.040]   is even if we might have been really placid.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.520]   during that period, are we going to feel?
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.800]   the same now that we're 12 years closer.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.920]   to retirement?
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:54.480]   Yeah, yeah, no, I think so. There's a couple of things.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.800]   that go on. Number one, every time.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.720]   there's a scary market.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.440]   Every time there's a scary market, it's.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:07.480]   We have these words like I don't know who said.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.720]   the famous quote. The last four words of any great investor.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.760]   this time it's different.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.520]   Right, but the reality is it is different.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.720]   It's always different, like the cause of.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.880]   the scary market is always different enough to trick us.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.120]   into believing that the outcome will be different.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.200]   and I think that quote is pointing to the outcome, not the.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.200]   cause, right? The outcome as far.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.360]   as far as the way the evidence of history shows.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.880]   us is we get through these things when they're scary.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:41.800]   But we don't know that when it's happening.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.320]   And there is some truth to the fact that we you.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.800]   don't know for sure.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.480]   Right, that's why it's called risk.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.320]   Risk isn't just volatility risk is.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.200]   the total of the.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.240]   idea that like look are the equity markets going to always work the way.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.280]   they always have worked. No, we don't know what's the.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.480]   best bet we can make.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.600]   The way the evidence of history right like it's.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.640]   the only it's the only way I want to live anyway, but.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.120]   it's also only the only reasonable bet to make.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.720]   But the event itself is different enough.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.160]   our lives are different enough that those two.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.360]   combined to help us make all sorts of crazy decisions.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.040]   In scary markets and greedy markets.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.800]   Right, and so I think it's just.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.920]   really smart for us to say, wait, wait, wait, let's get out of.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:33.800]   these branches here.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.560]   Like these way out on the branches, we all know what it feels like to be way out.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.680]   in the branches. I mean, look at a branch next time in the windstorm, right?
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.120]   like those things move a lot.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.680]   Then look at the trunk of the tree. It's not moving much the.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.720]   trunk of the tree. These products that we use the investment.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.760]   performance. Those are the branches at the trunk.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.840]   of the tree. Are you your life and your goals?
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.120]   If you haven't taken the time to clarify that.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.400]   you got no touchstone to.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.440]   grab when you're scared or greedy, one of the.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.560]   two, and so I think we can spend.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.960]   all of our time. It's in fact, it's sometimes it's even a useful exercise.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.080]   Some of us find it entertaining, right? Spend all the time.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.160]   with the financial pornography network. Understand all that stuff.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.400]   All that stuff out in the branches, but then we have to come back.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.520]   and go wait, wait, wait, wait. Why am I doing like for?
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.120]   me? That's time with my family, mainly outside.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.720]   and serving in the community.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.920]   Above that is a layer of goals like in order to meet that.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.040]   why time with my family, mainly outside serving the community is a set of.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.280]   goals. If I come back to those that.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.560]   I can say, are these goals all the same still?
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.520]   Well, maybe a few of them have changed. We don't need that much money.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.640]   We'd like to move to the country, whatever, but.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.160]   mostly those haven't changed. The value almost never changes.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.280]   time with my family, mainly outside serving the community. I've been saying that for 12.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.440]   years at least the goals. If I say.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.480]   to myself, the goals haven't changed, then I go.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.760]   great. So the purpose.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.840]   goals and then right above that I should be drawing.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.880]   this right purpose goals and then right above that I would be.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.120]   thinking process and that's investment process.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:18.080]   OK, and we all know the investment process predominantly here, right?
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.640]   We've got whatever the portfolio of passive.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:24.760]   funds that make sense. That's low cost and diversified.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.000]   whether it's the three portfolio fund or the four of the seven.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.040]   portfolio fund or whatever it is all mixed together.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.400]   in an allocation that matches the goals.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.440]   Then above the process sits product.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:41.400]   Least important part, but it's the part we all spend all.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.960]   of our time talking about product would be a set of mutual.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.640]   funds or ETFs that populate.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.400]   the product so we can go from.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.720]   wait, that's right. This is crazy or.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.880]   my is my purpose still the same or my goal is still the same.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.920]   Is the process still valid? OK, did I pick the right products?
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.960]   to validate to populate the process? The products are.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.680]   just things to populate the plan.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.440]   And if that all still yes, we can go OK, I.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.720]   guess I don't have to do anything today.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:15.960]   I want to take another audience question, Carl. It's.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.240]   a good one. What are three nudges you would recommend to improve?
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.360]   your finances?
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.280]   Uhm?
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.640]   So.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.560]   Yeah, I think I would probably start with I mean.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.640]   depending on where you are in this journey that.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.680]   look, we all know that one of the most important parts of this process.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.320]   is a great portfolio is amazing.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.600]   But if you don't have any money to put into it, it doesn't do any good.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:46.480]   So I think the idea of getting.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.480]   aligned with spending is always the place.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.560]   to start and one easy way to do this. I just think of it as.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.560]   finding.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.920]   Finding free money.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.960]   Right, so you track your spending.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:04.240]   And I wouldn't track my spending as a tool.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.320]   to beat yourself up with. So I'm going to have a little.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.400]   I'm the self declared king of permission granting. I have a little.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.480]   staff and this is my staff. It's actually the Apple Pencil.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.520]   but it's my staff and my staff. I'm going to grant you.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:20.040]   all permission to stop budgeting.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.240]   To beat yourself up.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.520]   Right, we're going to use budgeting as a tool.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.400]   A tool to help us meet goals. It's fun.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.440]   It's a game. I know I'm totally lying about the fun.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.480]   part, but I'm just trying to convince you like stop. It's not a.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.640]   tool for inflicting pain. It's a tool for awareness.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.720]   So I'm going to grant you permission to do that. So once you do that, you track.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.080]   and then you just look. Are there places where?
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.880]   Everybody have taken this through taken through this.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.960]   workshop around is.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:56.080]   Can I decree these are non discretionary?
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:56.760]   spending?
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.040]   That I don't really care about.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.840]   Like, can I get a better deal on the cable?
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.720]   Not asking to cancel it. I'm just asking you to make a phone call or.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.920]   two. Everybody that's gone through that is found a couple hundred.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.960]   dollars, right? Like my utility bills double checking.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.160]   that I'm paying the right tax rate on property taxes just.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.400]   take a month 45 days to look for free money.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.720]   When you find it automatically increase.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.760]   your contribution, well, assuming there's no credit.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:30.160]   card debt around right automatically increase your contribution.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.840]   into your S&P 500 fund.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:36.280]   Then the next level of that would be find.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.320]   more line spending. Is there money that you're?
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.720]   spending that you don't really care about?
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:45.080]   There are 100 bucks a month going out the door to.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.280]   Netflix that you never use or whatever, right? So.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.320]   that's the first thing I would do is just go on a treasure.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:51.840]   hunt.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.680]   To find free money.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.480]   Redirect it towards a more useful.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.520]   cause that cause might be paying down credit card debt. It might.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.640]   be spent taking your spouse on a date that you've.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.720]   been neglecting and it might be investing so.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.760]   that's I think maybe just one giant nudge is.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.200]   I would just understand I would look at spending more in the form.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.240]   of getting aligned with happiness.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.680]   not in the form of beating ourselves up. I think so much of our budgeting.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.000]   personal finance stuff is all around inflicting pain.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.560]   Right, make it painful. It should hurt. You should be deprived.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.600]   like no, I don't know that sounds fun. No reason it doesn't work for.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.240]   most people.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.440]   But if instead we can be around getting aligned.
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:39.160]   And spending lavishly on the things that.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.760]   we value, including investing.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.080]   And cutting ruthlessly on stuff that we don't care about, it.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:46.840]   could start to work.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:51.600]   So I just want to mention the name of the.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.640]   book that you mentioned Carl earlier on. You talked.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.920]   about the nurse who wrote the book about.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:01.200]   interviewing people as they were close to death. Mike.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.440]   Nolan tells us the book is called the top 5 regrets of.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:04.960]   the dying.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.960]   Ronnie, where I want to end on a question.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.280]   about Jack Bogle Carl where I want.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:16.440]   to ask you to just talk about how Jack.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.760]   affected impacted your career and.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.320]   the way that you think about investing in financial planning.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.040]   There's only.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:28.280]   There's only one.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:32.880]   I was trying to figure out who gave me.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.120]   the other quote. Oh, Oliver Wendell Holmes.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.000]   So here I'm going to draw this real quick.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:42.120]   There's only one quote that's had more impact on me.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.880]   than Jack's quote around simplicity.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.640]   And it's the Oliver Wendell.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.760]   Holmes quote. So here's how I my entire.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.800]   career has been built off.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.960]   of the idea that sometimes we have to cut through great.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.840]   swaths of complexity to get to the simplicity.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.880]   on the other side, and also the idea that.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.040]   that take what was it?
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.240]   Your isn't it your?
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.680]   Yeah, take 100 minus your age and put that in equities.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.960]   and then this and I don't really care about that part. What I care.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.280]   about it was the next sentence, which was there.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.200]   are plant there might be and I'm paraphrasing there might.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.160]   be plans. There might be investment strategies better than this.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.800]   But the number that is worse is infinite.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:33.320]   Like that changed my life. It changed the way I dealt with clients.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.640]   I used to have clients where we.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.920]   would have the simplest portfolios on the planet with millions.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.160]   of dollars and all my colleagues would be like what?
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.520]   And I used to always just say look if it's good.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.840]   enough for Bogle, it's good enough for me, right?
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.680]   Like, let's just put our focus on behavior and so the way I think.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.760]   but that simplicity quote that changed my life was really.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.680]   this idea that we start we head into.
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.920]   a problem around money and everything's going fine.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.920]   until we're like, oh, geez, what account should we put that in and where and.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.960]   what's growth in income and emerging markets? I.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:11.000]   don't know an expense ratio 12 be one fee.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.360]   like we and the whole industry has been trained.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.960]   sort of to drop us right there.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:20.080]   Almost like a sales technique, right? Like dig a hole.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.120]   throw a client into it and then look down.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.400]   and go hey, I'm the only one with a rope and what.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:29.120]   Bogle gave me permission to do was.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.160]   to take them here.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.520]   Right, like I can go through all this.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:37.480]   Consider the edge cases, the nuance that all.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.680]   of that stuff, but what clients what clients and.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.000]   readers and friends and real people in the world.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.120]   really want is they just want to be.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.120]   taken here. Now I know some of our stereotypical.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.120]   engineers want to do that, right? And that's.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.200]   fine. That's a good day at the office for me. Somebody who cares.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.480]   how smart I am, but most people.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.480]   just want to know that and he gave.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.880]   me permission to do that.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:07.680]   20 years ago and it changed completely.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.680]   changed my entire career. I have been spending my.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.560]   entire career since that time.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:16.880]   Being warned.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.400]   Warned about being too simple.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.440]   Like it happens almost daily. I get an email like.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.600]   are you worried about being and so about 10 years ago.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.520]   based on that quote.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.280]   I mean, that's always been my bedrock.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:35.560]   Is like wait, if it works here, I think.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.800]   it's OK for me too, but I was like wait, it sounds.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:42.080]   like there's an exciting place called too simple with like scary.
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:45.040]   monsters that if you go there, you'll be eaten and your career will be.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.960]   over and I was like I think I'm going to go see if I can find this.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.880]   place. Like how simple can I get?
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.960]   And I never found the monsters, right? All I found.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:57.040]   was this great quote from Bogle. So thanks for asking. That was.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:57.840]   that was fun.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.680]   Well, thank you Carl. Thanks so much for being here. This was just.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.800]   as much fun as I hoped it would be. I hope the audience enjoyed it.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.000]   and now I'm going to turn it over to Rick for some closing.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:08.680]   remarks.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.760]   Thank you, Christine. Thanks Rick.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.960]   Thank you Carl and thank you Christine for the outstanding.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.760]   interview.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.720]   Thank you Carl. Thank you Christine for the outstanding interview. It's always interesting.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.760]   to hear Carl's deep thinking views on money and life and.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:27.000]   I always say simplicity is an alpha.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.040]   that we talk about alpha all the time. Simplicity is one of the biggest.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.080]   alphas that you'll find. This presentation.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.400]   has been recorded and will be available soon on bogal center.
