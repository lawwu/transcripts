[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.200]   series live video event. The idea.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.240]   for a live online event came about.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.400]   after COVID-19 led to the cancellation of.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.840]   the 2020 Bogleheads conference, which.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.880]   would have been held in October.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.840]   As a matter of record, the board is.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.200]   talking about resuming the conference in.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.080]   2022.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.920]   In the meantime, we bring you this live speaker.

[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.840]   could not be more excited to introduce Carl Richards. He's.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.040]   joining us from London where he lives. It's already Saturday night.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.080]   there. Carl specializes in conveying.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.120]   sophisticated financial concepts in an.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.360]   easy to understand way, specifically using a Sharpie.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.400]   He is a certified financial planner and he's creator.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.680]   of the sketch guy column in the New York Times. He's also author.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.960]   of a couple of books, the one page financial plan.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.120]   a simple way to be smart about your money in the behavior.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.480]   gap. Simple ways to stop doing dumb things with money.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.720]   He also did the wonderful sketches for a book that just came out.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.760]   that I've made a contribution to called how I invest my.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.880]   money. Carl, welcome to the Boglehead speaker.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.960]   series. We're excited to have you here and I'm even more excited.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.000]   because I found out that you may be able to sketch a little bit.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.960]   for us today.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   Christine, it's an honor to be here and Rick and the whole board.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   thank you for giving me the opportunity with just a pleasure.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   I've always thought really highly of this group.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.240]   of people, so excited to be here. Well, thanks for donating.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.760]   your time. Wanted to start by asking about your particular.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.840]   focus for people who might not be familiar. You're.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   a CFP, a certified financial planner, so you're certainly.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.960]   very knowledgeable about matters of asset allocation and tax.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.000]   planning. But over the past decade or so, you've gotten more.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.320]   interested in what we might call sort of financial.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.400]   life planning. And let's talk about what.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.440]   that is. What why you're so enthused?
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.000]   about this idea of helping people align their financial plans?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.040]   with their bigger life goals. What kind of?
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.240]   set you on this journey?
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.040]   Yeah, I so.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.440]   I think it was just repeated so.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.600]   20 whatever 2223 years ago when I started.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.640]   in this sort of financial industry speaking.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.480]   broadly.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   I got into the.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.960]   Industry quite by accident, sort.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.680]   of. I applied to be a security guard thinking.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.200]   that the ad said I didn't realize the ad said securities.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.480]   instead of security and I didn't know the difference at.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.400]   the time. This is right during when I was at university and.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.880]   it was in the late 90s, right? And there's a lot of exciting.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.280]   things going on in the late 90s and so.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.600]   after I got over the fact that I wasn't a security guard I.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.760]   was on the phone at a big call center.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.920]   actually at Fidelity Investments, one of their big call centers at the.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.000]   time it was their national call center in Salt Lake and.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.320]   answering phones.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.720]   And.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.520]   I just remember being struck for that. I mean.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.720]   it was years. I remember just being sort of like unmoored.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.560]   a bit about this.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.880]   sense of it wasn't about spreadsheets.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.920]   and calculators, right? I couldn't put words to it, but I was like.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.800]   I didn't expect it to be so emotional. I didn't expect. I was like, wait, this is.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.040]   spreadsheets and calculators, isn't it? And it turns out it's not.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.240]   And then I spent a.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.400]   decade and a half sort of working with individual clients.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   and seeing this repeated pattern.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.920]   of what we think our job.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.000]   is as investors.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and then even if you want to take it one step further.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.040]   that we think what the industry thinks his job is.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.360]   to provide products.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.280]   And I just saw this repeated.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.320]   focus on maybe the best comparison is whether.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.440]   I should take a plane arguing and researching about whether I should take.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.000]   a plane, a train, or an automobile on a trip.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.800]   Before we had decided where we were going to go.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.680]   And this idea of deciding where you want to go right like.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.200]   that to me, we can build the best asset allocation.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.680]   ever created by the mind of man smartest the.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.920]   most research back the most evidence based the most.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.400]   inexpensive. We can do all of those things, but.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.520]   if it doesn't get us where we want to go, what's the point? And.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.440]   as this group knows really well, like one behavioral mistake will blow.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.880]   the whole thing up anyway, so we can't get the behavior right.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.960]   and we can't get the underlying sort of I'll.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.040]   use the term goals very loosely, but if we can't get the underlying.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.280]   goals right, we sort of wake up and we're seeing this all.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.360]   over the world. People are waking up and saying.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   What was it all for?
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.000]   You know what? Is this really what I wanted and?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.400]   so I think.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.240]   The idea of spending some time getting clear about why.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.600]   we're doing it in the first place has become.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.760]   to me, everything else feels like hacking at the branches.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.800]   that we can make marginal improvements. But until we.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.960]   get that right, or at least until we start guessing.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.880]   at that, we're never going to get it right, but until we start guessing.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.280]   at that, the rest sort of.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.680]   loses its importance. That's really how I started focusing.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.400]   on that, so let's talk about this. I think.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.440]   you probably know this group of bogal heads. We've got a group of.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.600]   people who are really good at the spreadsheet.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.880]   and calculator piece and how about?
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.400]   how can we talk about how we get better at the?
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.480]   other piece of it at articulating our goals and our?
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.560]   vision for our lives? What are the questions that we should be asking?
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.200]   ourselves?
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.240]   Yeah, that's a really good question. I mean, I think the first thing we need to do is sort of realize.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.440]   like there's this sort of movement that I guess.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.720]   people call life planning and I've never really never resonated.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.160]   a lot with me simply because life.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.480]   planning to me feels and goal based planning feels.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.520]   like oxygen based breathing.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.640]   Right, like of course you should have goals for what.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.960]   you're doing right? So I think the.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.360]   first thing is just to say look, this isn't about crying on the couch.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.400]   It's not about therapy. It's not about.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.800]   getting becoming one with yourself. It's just simply.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.000]   about saying look the purpose.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.960]   Of financial planning and I'm using that.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.160]   term broadly is to align.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.840]   your use of capital with what's important.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.520]   to you.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.400]   OK, and obviously as you mentioned this group.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.680]   understands once like once.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.720]   we need to deploy capital, we understand at least the.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.360]   process of figuring out how to do it in a sophisticated.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.880]   way.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.480]   So the question becomes how do we align that?
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.320]   What we're so good at.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.160]   With what's important to us and it starts.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.240]   by. I mean, I just didn't. I didn't realize I don't.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.280]   know why I didn't realize how hard that is for us.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.280]   to get clear about what's important to us.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.320]   We're not used to thinking about it. We're not used.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.400]   to having an idea of like look.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.680]   And part of the reason is mimetic were so.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.720]   caught up in mimetic desire, right? Like looking we don't.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.600]   know how we don't even know how to know what we want.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.160]   What we know is to look at what other.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   people do.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.920]   Right, and take our clues from them, and this is only gotten harder with.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.080]   sort of the Instagram lives. So many of us are trying.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.160]   to keep up with. It's really hard to get clear, and so I.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160]   think the way to think through this is.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.200]   just to take the time like where do you?
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.240]   want to go?
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.840]   What's important to you? I love the idea of.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.000]   the calendar and the checkbook never lie.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.880]   Right, so I don't. I don't really care what.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.920]   you say is important to you. Christine, show me your calendar.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.960]   in your checkbook and I'll tell you what's important.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.360]   to you.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.080]   So this idea if I were to draw.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.120]   it and maybe we should have our first experiment.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.640]   here. If I were.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.560]   let me just connect this real quick. I'll.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.360]   connect my iPad to the screen.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.440]   There we go now. Let me share it if I were to.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.400]   Here we go. Tell me Christine, can you see that?
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.680]   I yes, I can.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.360]   see it. OK, I assume our audience can as well perfect.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.560]   Well, I'll just I'll look for it 'cause I can see you.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.880]   So if you give me some clue that it's not working, I'll stop.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.920]   So let's just think about.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.240]   let's just use a word like values.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.880]   I think you could substitute a lot of words like what's.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.440]   important to me values. I love purpose.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.680]   I love the idea of purpose and.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.440]   if we.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.040]   But if we had a set of values and then we.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.080]   looked at and we'll talk if it's OK, we can talk.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.160]   for a minute about how do we even get clear about this, but if we.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.920]   then looked at how we.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.480]   use our money and our time.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.880]   And we'll just call those actions. Often there's a gap.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.160]   here and that gap is called.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:25.960]   being a human.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.080]   Right, like and it's really it's really.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.200]   this gap here is.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.440]   Is really painful, actually.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.320]   Right when you wake up and say gosh, I spent all that time.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.120]   At the office, I could have spent more time with the kids or I.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.360]   we've got plenty of money, but we never.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.760]   enjoyed it or you hear these things constantly.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.800]   like I can't remember the name of the book, but it was the.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.000]   palliative care nurse, the nurse at the end of life nurse.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.880]   that took care of so many people, and she wrote that book about what their.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.960]   common regrets were, and it was always like.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.040]   it was always the things they hadn't done. There was very few.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.480]   regrets about stuff they had. People didn't really remember the mistakes.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.520]   they'd made. They remembered the things they hadn't done, and so there's this.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.560]   often this gap between what we say is important to us and what.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.680]   we're actually doing with our time and money and.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.760]   so I just am hopeful that we can.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.000]   that we can somehow get that those.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.800]   circles just can.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.680]   we start.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.840]   To see some of this overlap and wouldn't it be amazing.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.480]   if that was a Venn diagram?
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.440]   Right where there was perfect overlap. I mean, I had that once Christmas.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.640]   Eve. I remember right the kids.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.720]   sitting on the couch. The snow is falling. The dog was there doing.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.800]   the thing and then the next morning. Of course we woke up.
