[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.800]   - I am thrilled to kick off this panel discussion
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.280]   by introducing our panelists here today.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.720]   We've got three great individuals
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.080]   who work on various aspects of retirement planning.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.320]   On your far left is Rob Berger.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.360]   Rob is the founder of RobBerger.com
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.400]   and the Financial Freedom Show.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.280]   He has a YouTube channel where he has interviewed
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.880]   a lot of folks, he's interviewed me,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.440]   I know he's interviewed a lot of people
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.360]   who work on retirement planning.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.960]   He has also published a book called
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.040]   Retire Before Mom and Dad.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.280]   And Rob was a fairly early retiree
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.300]   and often writes about how he was able to achieve that
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.680]   and how he manages drawdown
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.560]   during a fairly long time horizon.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.280]   John Luskin is here in the middle of our three panelists.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.380]   John, many of you know, does a lot for us
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.720]   in the Bogleheads community.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.580]   He hosts the Bogleheads Twitter spaces
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.120]   where he has managed to land some amazing guests.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.440]   And I believe those are all recorded for posterity.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.200]   So if, like me, you're not sure how to operate
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.580]   Twitter spaces, you can replay them.
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.120]   He also is the producer of the Bogleheads Live podcasts.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.440]   And John is a certified financial planner.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.280]   He's fee-only, advice-only.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.720]   And last but not least, Steve Chen is here
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.040]   to my immediate right.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.760]   Steve is the founder and CEO of New Retirement,
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.440]   which is a fabulous resource, great website,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.880]   financial planning platform that includes
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.400]   some do-it-yourself software for retirement planning,
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.240]   articles, podcasts, access to CFPs, importantly.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.880]   They will help you find a CFP
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.720]   that matches what you're looking for.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.440]   So we thought, for this session,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.040]   that we would dive into some of the big questions
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.360]   that cross our minds as we approach retirement
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.120]   and as we move into retirement.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.360]   So at the top of the list,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.080]   I thought we would kind of think about people
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.080]   in the 55 to 65 year range, the pre-retiree range.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.360]   And one thing that they might be thinking about
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.780]   is how to think about spending in retirement,
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.680]   how much you'll spend in retirement.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.280]   There are these rough rules of thumb,
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.320]   like the 80% income replacement rate.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.920]   But I think a big question for people
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.160]   embarking on retirement today is,
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.120]   with inflation as it is, how should I think about
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.600]   how much I'll actually spend in retirement?
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.960]   Steve, you wanna take that?
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.720]   - Sure, thanks, Christine.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.680]   So I think for a lot of our users,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.480]   they definitely, when they're preparing
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.280]   or measuring expenses, taking a close look
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.560]   at what they're actually spending,
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.960]   breaking it down, building budgets
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.680]   so they have a good handle on what's happening.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.280]   And then as they transition,
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.000]   I think a big consideration is,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.120]   are they gonna make any giant gear shifts?
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.840]   So if they're thinking about relocating,
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.680]   will that change their expected expense ratio?
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.800]   Like, I live in California,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.200]   if I was gonna move to Florida,
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.040]   would my cost of living be lower?
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.880]   My tax rate from a state income tax perspective
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.480]   would be different, so that kind of factor
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.960]   would go into it.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.560]   And I think at a high level,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.200]   you know, what Michael Kitsa says
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.520]   in some of the research he's posted
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.160]   about spending in retirement,
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.400]   it does tend to decline over time.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.840]   So I think on average, people can expect
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.040]   that their expenses will decline
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.880]   about 1% on a real basis every year,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.160]   so about 10% per decade.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.480]   And if you step back, and I think a lot of people
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.200]   are really, hey, I'm planning on having
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.640]   the same spending rate at 85 as I have at 60,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.320]   and the reality is that for most people, that's not true.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.440]   You're gonna be spending a lot less at 85.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.000]   You're gonna be traveling, moving less.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.960]   Typically, you know, you're gonna be,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.640]   your costs will be generally lower.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.000]   So you shouldn't necessarily over-save
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.640]   and over-optimize for, you know, long-time horizons,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.680]   and think about using some of your, you know,
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.840]   spending more earlier to enjoy your human capital.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.240]   - So David Blanchett did some research on this,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.160]   the retirement spending smile,
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.320]   so folks can check that out,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.120]   and talks about that phenomenon.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.600]   Spending does decrease as you move through retirement.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.440]   In those earlier years, those go-go years,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.280]   you're gonna wanna travel,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.200]   you're gonna go out to that fancy restaurant,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.240]   but then as you get older,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.560]   you're not gonna wanna do that stuff,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.400]   and maybe it's just gonna be at the soup plantation
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.320]   for you at that point.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.720]   So spending on a real basis
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.680]   does decline throughout retirement.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.160]   Now, a related question I get from a lot of folks
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.400]   is can I retire?
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.120]   And then my question to them is gonna be,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.920]   well, how much are you spending?
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.400]   And a lot of folks don't necessarily
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.840]   know the answer to this,
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.640]   and this is where I ask them to,
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.120]   all right, now you've gotta go out and do some homework.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.720]   You've gotta track your spending,
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.400]   figure out what you actually are spending,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.800]   what you're spending it on.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.560]   Now, this doesn't have to be a hard or difficult process.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.720]   There's a couple, or gosh, there's more than a couple.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.520]   Great financial tools that can help you with this process.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.480]   Mint.com is a free tool that can help you
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.880]   track your spending, it can categorize your spending.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.840]   Youneedabudget.com is also a popular tool.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.560]   It's not free, it's $12 a month
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.720]   or something nominal like that.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.560]   And I mention those tools
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.560]   'cause those are a couple tools
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.720]   that the folks that I work with,
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.880]   a lot of do-it-yourself investors,
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.000]   a lot of bold heads seem to like a lot.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.920]   So that's gonna be a big part
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.320]   of the early steps of retirement planning,
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.520]   figure out what you're spending
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.840]   and figure out what categories you're spending is in,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.200]   and that's gonna help you with your retirement planning.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.120]   - Okay, so another question on our list was Social Security.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.680]   And my guess is that many, most of you
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.320]   were in Mike Piper's great session earlier
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.120]   where he talked about the various dimensions
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.000]   of developing a Social Security strategy.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.520]   But one thing I wanted to pick up on,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.760]   I was looking on the boards
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.440]   where we ask people for questions,
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.320]   so on the Bogleheads forum.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.400]   And a great question came up is that
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.000]   I think a lot of people understand
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.480]   why they should delay Social Security.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.880]   But the question is, how do you bridge those years
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.240]   from when you retire
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.280]   to when you eventually begin claiming benefits?
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.640]   Where do you go for those funds?
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.600]   I guess Mike somewhat addressed that,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.320]   but maybe you all can talk about that.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.520]   And also what those funds should be invested in
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.720]   in the years that you are drawing more heavily
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.880]   upon your portfolio than you might later on
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.800]   when Social Security comes online.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.440]   Rob, maybe you wanna tackle that one?
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.120]   - Well, I'd take, I don't know if it's a controversial view,
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.200]   I don't feel that it is,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.720]   but in terms of where you should invest your money,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.960]   even as you're spending it,
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.160]   I kind of view you should have an asset allocation.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.480]   I think for most retirees,
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.040]   it's in the 50 to 75% range for stocks,
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.720]   and that's a gross generalization
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.160]   that won't apply to countless situations.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.720]   But when we think about safe withdrawal rates
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.560]   and that sort of thing,
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.800]   if you go back to Bill Bingen's work
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.600]   and Guyton Klinger and others,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.040]   that's generally where they say
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.200]   your stock allocation should be.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.520]   And I think that's true even if you're 60
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.200]   and you're taking out money
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.840]   before you take Social Security when you're 70.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.080]   And I'm just a big believer in you pull the money out,
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.800]   maybe it's gonna come from dividends and interest
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.160]   in a taxable account first,
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.480]   and then maybe you're selling shares
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.120]   and whatever accounts make the most sense
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.280]   from a tax perspective,
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.600]   and then you're just rebalancing.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.760]   Others might wanna hold more cash
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.720]   just to have some level of comfort.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.200]   And that becomes, I think, just a personal decision,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.120]   as long as it doesn't become too much cash,
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.840]   in which case, other than in 2022,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.640]   might weigh on the portfolio a bit.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.600]   But I think it comes down
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.800]   to a lot of personal preference at that point.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.440]   - Okay, so I wanna follow up on that
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.480]   because there was another question on the boards
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.840]   about in-retirement asset allocation,
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.760]   what that should look like.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.600]   And this question was starred an asterisk by several users,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.200]   so I wanna make sure we get to it.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.440]   The question is, if someone has, say,
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.240]   a pension and Social Security
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.560]   that is supplying much of their income needs,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.760]   how should the portfolio be invested?
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.400]   And how do non-portfolio income sources
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.520]   like Social Security and pension
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.640]   affect what the asset allocation should look like?
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.480]   Anyone?
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.160]   - Yeah, I wanna just back up one second
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.080]   to talk about the Social Security timing questions.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.440]   One thing a lot of our users talk about
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.160]   is using that window.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.400]   So they're delaying Social Security
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.520]   to try to maximize their lifetime income,
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.000]   protect their spouses, right, all that good stuff.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.880]   But they're also, it creates,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.320]   many of them, if they have the opportunity,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.200]   they can engineer their income levels over multiple years,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.400]   and they're trying to create this window
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.680]   where they can do Roth conversions.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.440]   And so in an ideal world,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.920]   they walk into that environment with taxable,
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.800]   tax-deferred, and tax-exempt,
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.920]   and then they're essentially trying to move money
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.360]   between tax-deferred and tax-exempt
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   and leverage their taxable account
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.200]   to pay the taxes and survive in that window.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.960]   But if they're, I think the interesting perspective is,
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.640]   is that if you get to a certain level of assets,
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.840]   you can really,
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.720]   and you look across long enough time horizons,
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.280]   you can really start to engineer your tax situation
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   in a much more meaningful way.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.440]   So I just wanna touch on that point.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.520]   - Okay.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.800]   So in retirement asset allocation
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.680]   in the presence of non-portfolio income sources,
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.080]   how they affect, how they relate to one another?
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.360]   - I'm happy to try.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.280]   So, you know, there's one theory that says
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.480]   you may maybe try to calculate the present value
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.000]   of these guaranteed incomes,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.640]   and maybe that should be part of your fixed bond
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.880]   or fixed income portfolio.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.000]   I think there's some merit to that.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.600]   But for me, the starting point is fine,
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.680]   you've got whatever sources of guaranteed income
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.560]   that covers a certain amount of expenses, what's left?
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.040]   How much do you need to spend beyond that?
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.600]   And what percentage of your portfolio
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.080]   does that additional expense represent
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.880]   is how I like to think about it.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.240]   Because if the answer to that is 4%,
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.680]   so even after the guaranteed income,
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.040]   I need to take, let's say 4% on my portfolio
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.360]   in the first year,
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.640]   then I'm still at that 50 to 75% stock range.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.440]   Unless maybe, again, there's countless exceptions,
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.800]   maybe it's 4%, but a lot of that is for wants, not needs.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.360]   And so maybe, you know, that maybe that's your fund money
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.680]   and your guaranteed sources of income pay the utility bills.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.120]   So, you know, there could be a lot of variation there.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.920]   But if you're gonna still need 4% from your portfolio,
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.680]   I think that really should, in my view,
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.040]   that should drive the asset allocation decision.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.960]   And if the answer is, yeah, it's not that bad,
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.360]   I only need one and a half or 2% of my portfolio,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.120]   then frankly, at least from a surviving retirement,
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.680]   the asset allocation at that level
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.160]   probably doesn't matter much.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.360]   - Wanted to talk about annuities
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.640]   and we had a lively discussion about annuities
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.480]   at our lunch table.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.640]   So I wanna recapture some of that magic.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.520]   But annuities are starting to get more interesting,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.760]   more interest, especially as yields are higher
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.280]   and that in turn helps enhance annuity payouts.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.440]   So maybe as a starting point,
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.160]   we could talk about who is the best candidate
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.320]   for some sort of an annuity product.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.120]   And then I'd also like to talk about when,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.200]   how much and what types.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.040]   - Well, first things first.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.680]   So first, I know a lot of folks that hear the word annuity
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.640]   and they cringe or they get terrified
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.160]   and they wanna run screaming,
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.800]   but annuities themselves aren't the issue.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.880]   The issue is high fees and complexity.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.600]   So it's not necessarily that all annuities are bad,
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.640]   it's that those annuities that are high fee and complex,
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.480]   those are bad.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   Those are the ones that we generally
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.800]   wanna run screaming from.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.080]   Same thing when it comes to mutual funds,
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.880]   high fee, complicated mutual funds,
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.160]   really fancy active management strategy with high fees.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.760]   That's what we wanna run screaming from.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.880]   That's not all mutual funds entirely.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.520]   So when it comes to annuities,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.520]   simple low cost annuities can be a reasonable approach
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.920]   for some retirees.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.480]   So specifically a single premium immediate annuity,
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.840]   you're creating your own pension.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.880]   You're gonna put in a lump sum once
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.560]   and then you're gonna get a monthly income payment for life.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.080]   And depending upon your goals
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.120]   and what your preferences are,
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.960]   that could be reasonable for you.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.320]   So if you don't like managing a portfolio,
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.000]   then a single premium immediate annuity can be reasonable.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.040]   If you are very risk averse,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.440]   if you don't like seeing the value
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.080]   of your investments decrease,
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.400]   then maybe a SPIA is right for you.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.800]   So you wanna look at your personal goals,
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.040]   your personal preferences to figure out
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.320]   if a simple low cost annuity could be appropriate.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   One more consideration in buying a SPIA, that longevity.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.640]   So if you're really concerned about outliving your money,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.840]   SPIA can be a reasonable approach.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.000]   - Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.600]   Just to refund this a minute,
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.640]   I think you have to think about insurance.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.120]   I mean, an annuity is an insurance product,
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.840]   it's not an investment product.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.520]   And so if you're using it, think of it like insurance.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.760]   So if you're buying a SPIA,
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.360]   you're essentially insuring
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.760]   I wanna have a certain quality of life.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.000]   If you wanna layer that annuity
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.120]   on top of your social security,
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.080]   and if you wanna buy a deferred income annuity,
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.720]   some people call it longevity insurance.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.360]   You're basically hedging out,
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.120]   hey, I might live a long time.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.960]   One strategy some people are thinking about,
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.680]   but I think almost no one does is,
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.080]   okay, I could buy a deferred annuity at 60,
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.640]   have it kick in at 85 when I'm not expected to be alive,
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.160]   so you can actually get quite a lot of income
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.760]   for a pretty low cost.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.680]   But it does constrain your planning window,
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.360]   'cause then you only have to plan for a set amount of time.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.040]   So there's a purpose for an insurance.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.280]   You're essentially leveraging your mortality credits,
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.000]   you're mutualizing your risk.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.320]   It's very different than being an individual investor
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.920]   and trying to manage your portfolio
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.280]   for an unknown inflation and longevity horizon.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.880]   - Yeah, I think it's important to understand
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.160]   why you want the annuity in the first place.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.600]   So like you've mentioned, in some cases, it's longevity.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.160]   You're afraid you'll live to 110.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.600]   And that could dictate the type of annuity
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.760]   or the amount you put into an annuity.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.280]   But for others, it's really just part
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.720]   of retirement planning from the very beginning.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.640]   It's not so much a fear of longevity,
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.600]   but it's just a comfortable way to manage your portfolio.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.440]   And so for me, for that kind of person,
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.360]   the ideal candidate is someone who,
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.320]   one, has not under-saved for retirement in the first place,
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.560]   'cause if you have an annuity, it won't save you.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.040]   You haven't over-saved for retirement,
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.360]   'cause if you have, you don't need an annuity.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.560]   But you're somewhere in the middle,
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.160]   and 2022 scares you to death,
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160]   and you're not sleeping well at night.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.800]   It may make really good sense
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.920]   to annuitize a part of your portfolio.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.920]   On the other hand, maybe you're very comfortable in 2022,
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.240]   and you haven't lost any sleep,
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.840]   and you're gonna rebalance, and you're like,
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.280]   bring it, I got whatever you can bring me.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.280]   I can take it, except for 8.2% inflation.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.960]   But other than that, you can handle it.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.200]   Then annuity might not make sense,
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.640]   particularly if you're thinking about bequests
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.320]   to family members or charities or that sort of thing.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.320]   - Well, Rob, I wanna pick up on something you just said,
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.760]   which is inflation in relation to annuities,
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.920]   that if we continue to see fairly high inflation,
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.080]   it eats away at the purchasing power
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.560]   from that income stream that you're able to earn.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.200]   So should that turn people off annuities?
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.320]   How should they think about that,
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.960]   protecting their purchasing power
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.520]   if that's the goal of the annuity?
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.480]   - Yeah, I don't think it disqualifies an annuity,
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.800]   and I'll just say right up front,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.440]   I'm not an expert on annuity pricing.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.840]   But the interest rate environment and inflation
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.000]   is obviously gonna affect the pricing of annuities.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.440]   So it's really a question of evaluating the pricing
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.240]   under the economic circumstances that we have.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.000]   If I were going to do that personally,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.360]   I would hire someone to help me with that analysis.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.160]   Obviously not someone who was gonna actually
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.200]   sell me the annuity.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.160]   But yeah, I mean, I think it's a good question,
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.520]   but it's all gonna get factored
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.280]   into the pricing of annuities at some level.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.800]   But whether any particular annuity is a smart purchase
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.000]   is just gonna depend on countless factors, I think.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.640]   - One related topic on this is you can actually
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.400]   dollar cost average into annuities
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.840]   and hedge out the interest rate movements over time
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.840]   if you wanna do it.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.880]   So if you're committed to that strategy,
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.400]   one thing is you're accumulating,
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.600]   and then when you go to transition,
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.040]   you have a five-year window or something,
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.720]   and you start buying layers of income over time
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.760]   if that's what you wanna do.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.880]   - Yeah, it's certainly not gonna be a one-for-one,
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.960]   but we talked about, hey, spending decreases in retirement.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.920]   So yes, you have some risk of losing purchasing power
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.840]   from those annuity payments,
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.360]   but you're probably gonna spend less money
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.520]   in retirement anyway.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.760]   Now, to manage that inflation risk,
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.600]   maybe it doesn't make sense
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.520]   to put all your money into the annuity.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.480]   You're still gonna have a portion of your money
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.040]   in a stock and bond portfolio,
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.400]   and that stock portion in the long term, hopefully,
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.240]   is going to grow more so than inflation,
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.840]   and that can help you with that tail end
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.640]   of that spending smile when you get really
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.480]   to an advanced age,
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.320]   and then you have those higher medical expenses.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.160]   That's when that inflation adjusted part of your portfolio,
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.640]   those stocks can help manage those expenses.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.840]   - Okay, and I wanna hit on that topic
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.800]   of higher healthcare, long-term care costs in just a second,
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.040]   but before that, before we leave annuities,
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.240]   I want to tackle a question that came from Squirrel1963
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.880]   on the Bogleheads Forum.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.520]   At what age should someone annuitize?
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.480]   - That's a fantastic question.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.840]   The first thing that comes to mind
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.600]   is gonna be that fragile decade.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.880]   It's a term by Wade Fowler.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.160]   There's a ton of research on retirement planning,
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.280]   and that fragile decade is gonna be those five years before
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.080]   and those five years after retirement,
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.640]   and the reason why it's that fragile decade
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.080]   is 'cause you generally want to avoid
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.160]   having a stock market crash at that time.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.840]   Now, certainly, we can't avoid that,
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.320]   so we have to figure out what is gonna be
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.600]   our risk management tools in doing that,
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.000]   and having that annuity payment come in at that time
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.280]   is gonna mean you don't need to take as much out
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.120]   from your portfolio.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.360]   Now, being flexible with spending
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.080]   can also help manage risk at that time as well.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.560]   - Yeah, I mean, not to be self-serving,
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.120]   but I think this is an example
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.440]   of where we think people should build their financial plans
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.840]   and talk to a fiduciary who's completely independent
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.080]   about these kinds of decisions,
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.680]   'cause, I mean, every situation's unique.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.440]   It's hard to answer that question, right?
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.800]   There's like a million different variables
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.360]   that are happening around you and your family
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.160]   and what you think the future's gonna hold
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.640]   and your asset size and so forth.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.040]   So, I mean, I think thinking through where you're at,
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.840]   what could happen, where you wanna go, what might happen,
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.360]   and then intelligently hedging those risks out
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.880]   is a good conversation and a good use of capital.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.600]   Doesn't mean signing up for like a 1% financial advisor
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.080]   that's gonna take that for life.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.000]   You can get a flat fee or fee-only financial advice,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   just like you talk to your CPA these days.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.600]   - Yeah, I wanna add one more note on annuity 101,
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.720]   is that this is an insurance product.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.320]   This is not an investment.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.200]   And on average, when you buy insurance, you lose.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.560]   So if that's not a prospect that you're comfortable with,
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.160]   consider that in the decision to purchase an annuity.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.000]   Now, in the rare event
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.760]   that you have prolonged life expectancy,
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.840]   more so than what the actuaries at the insurance company
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.960]   think you're gonna live until,
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.240]   then certainly it can come out ahead.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.040]   But generally, you're gonna buy insurance to manage risk,
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.360]   not to come out ahead financially.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.840]   - So I want to move over to a perennially hot-button issue
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.160]   in relation to retirement planning,
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.640]   which is spending, safe spending.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.040]   So let's just use the 4% guideline
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.240]   as a starting point for this discussion.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.560]   Rob, I'm hoping you can start here.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.760]   And also just to keep everyone following along,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.080]   let's talk about the 4% guideline,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.640]   what it holds, what it means.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.320]   Maybe you can even give an example
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.000]   of how that would translate into cash flows.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.200]   - Yeah, so the 4% rule comes initially
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.960]   from a paper by Bill Bingen in 1994.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.000]   And what he tried to determine was, as a percentage,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.920]   what's the most you can spend from a portfolio
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.880]   in the first year, such that you then adjust that amount,
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.160]   whatever it happens to be, a million-dollar portfolio,
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.280]   let's say it's 40 grand, that you can adjust it by CPI
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.080]   each year thereafter in retirement.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.240]   And the goal was to live 30 years
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.880]   with money still in the bank, and then you could die.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.240]   And so he looked at it from 1926 to 1976,
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.120]   no, yeah, to 1976, I think.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.840]   And he found the amount you could take out each year
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.640]   and still last for 30 years, of course,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.680]   varied from year to year significantly.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.400]   Some years you could take out 8% or 9% in the first year.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.160]   But the lowest, which I think was 1966, was 4%.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.440]   So that kind of gave us the 4% rule.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.640]   And since then, there's been just a ton of research.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.760]   Michael Kitsis took it back to 1871.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.600]   And so far, the lowest is 4%.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.640]   It comes from, we'll call it the late '60s.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.600]   Why?
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.600]   Because of the inflation that I think everyone
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.040]   in this room remembers, just about in the '70s
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.600]   and into, what, '81, '82, and the stock market returns.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.520]   It just crushed retirees, a very difficult time to retire.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   But so that got us the 4% rule.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.920]   So when we think about managing sequence of risk,
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.240]   one way to do it is to start with a very low starting,
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.760]   spending percentage.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.960]   And if we follow the history, it's 4%.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.760]   And of course, the big question is
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.400]   whether the 4% rule is still valid today.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.440]   Do you want me to dive into that or should I stop talking?
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.280]   - No, please.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.720]   - Okay. (audience laughing)
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.160]   So my view is it's still as valid as it's ever been.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.880]   It certainly has, I think, some limits
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.880]   as to practical application.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.640]   I've only met one person who ever told me
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.840]   that in retirement, they actually followed the 4% rule
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.440]   and that person's name was Bill Bingen.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.120]   He told me that about two months ago.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.560]   I think as a practical matter,
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.360]   most retirees just, we don't think about it that way.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.920]   It might be good for planning.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.520]   But at least even in 2022, I think it's still valid.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.080]   Now, could we have a decade of 8% inflation?
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.840]   Sure, I guess we could.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.440]   And could the stock market go sideways for a decade?
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.560]   And could it turn out that, I don't know,
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.960]   2019 gave us the 3.8% rule?
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.720]   Sure, that's very possible.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.520]   But at least so far, what we're experiencing
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.960]   as difficult as it is kind of pales in comparison
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.920]   to the decade or more that folks that retired
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.760]   in the late '60s had to live through.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.040]   And I don't have an opinion
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.440]   as to whether that will repeat itself.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440]   I have no idea.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.160]   But I still think it's as valid as it's ever been
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.240]   from a planning perspective.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.200]   - Yeah, I think Carson Jeske,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.160]   who's early retirement now,
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.480]   I think he's like a 3.3% safe withdrawal rate.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.560]   And I feel like that's in the range.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.640]   I mean, in general, like all of us are,
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.800]   definitely the Volga folks are betting
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.240]   on the long-term productivity of the US economy,
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.480]   that it's gonna kind of keep generally
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.320]   going in that direction.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.840]   And you wanna be generally betting on that.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.240]   And if that persists, we'll be good.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.400]   I mean, I think the thing that keeps me,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.440]   that I think about, if you really zoom out,
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.880]   is did demographic trends in our country
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.320]   lead us down the path of Japan,
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.280]   which had a really long-run bad return scenario,
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.880]   I think mainly driven by demographics.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.680]   Although we don't face the same thing here.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.520]   We just have to be careful
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.680]   about continuing to grow our productive population.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.400]   - I think the 4% rule of thumb is fine.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.000]   What I encourage folks to consider is that,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.480]   hey, Bill Bengen, he wrote this paper a few decades ago,
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.920]   and he got 4% more recently.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.320]   He's done some more research.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.560]   He added small cap value to his portfolio,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.800]   and now it's 4.5% or 4.7%.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.520]   Bill's not the only person to look at this question.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.840]   A lot of folks have looked at this question.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.560]   They all have come up with their own unique answer.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.720]   Wade Pfau, he got 2.4%.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.640]   Christine Benz and her team, they did a,
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.000]   rather, let me give some context.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.800]   So Bill Bengen, right, historical-looking performance.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.840]   Christine Benz and her team,
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.360]   they put some numbers into a computer.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.080]   The computer made up some simulations,
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.040]   and the computer said, hey, it's actually 3.3%
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.080]   if you can accept the 10% failure rate.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.160]   And if you can't accept the 10% failure rate,
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.360]   now you can only take out 1.9%.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.360]   Correct me if I'm wrong on that number.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.360]   So that's to say, whether you choose 4% or 4.5 or 1.9,
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.120]   or the Guyton-Klinger model,
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.080]   which is a variable distribution strategy,
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.160]   which says, hey, market does well, you're gonna spend more.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.120]   Market does poorly, now you're gonna spend less.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.000]   I think all those are fine, right?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.880]   Whether you use historic based on that safe withdrawal rate,
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.440]   whether you use the Monte Carlo simulation, that's all okay,
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.440]   but you just wanna look at it regularly.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.640]   That's gonna be more important
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.840]   than whatever strategy you choose.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.320]   Don't go forward blindly every single year,
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.760]   not making any adjustments to your plan.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.480]   - Yeah, thanks for that, all of you.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.800]   I wanna follow up.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.720]   It does seem like within the research
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.480]   about safe withdrawal rates,
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.600]   there's convergence around that idea
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.960]   that you should be variable
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.800]   if you possibly can make adjustments.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.000]   And there are all sorts of methods
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.320]   for making those adjustments.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.760]   Any favorites if someone
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.240]   is going to employ a variable strategy?
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.200]   - I'll tell one quick story about a guy.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.080]   I just interviewed this guy named Joe Kuhn.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.640]   So he's a quick backstory.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.320]   He was a plant manager, and then he retired at 54,
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.400]   and started making YouTube videos.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.400]   And anyway, became kind of YouTube famous.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.880]   You can check him out.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.720]   I was doing a quick podcast with him,
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.960]   and what he's done is he's got a bucket strategy,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.440]   but he has four years in cash.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.760]   So we were talking about the situation.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.920]   He's like, "Well, yeah, if things stay volatile
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.160]   "for another two and a half years,
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.360]   "I'll start getting nervous."
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.800]   Now, that's a huge cash allocation,
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.040]   but he's basically sitting tight like,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.720]   "Okay, whatever, I'm just gonna keep spending my money."
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.560]   And then he's got a bucket and a balance fund,
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.960]   and he's got the rest and 100% equities,
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.800]   and that's how he manages it.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.880]   Now, he lives in Evansville, Indiana.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.280]   Cost of living is lower, and everything seems to be fine.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.280]   So, I mean, that's one kind of massive longer cycle
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.000]   market timing variability approach.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.240]   - Yeah, a couple of thoughts here.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.640]   It's very difficult to know if things are going poorly.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.840]   We may feel that they're going poorly, like in 2022,
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.160]   but if you look back at 1966,
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.520]   there was nothing going on in 1966, really,
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.680]   that would have said, "Oh my goodness,
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.600]   "this turns out to be the worst time to retire
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.160]   "since the Civil War."
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.880]   Because the things that made '66 so bad hadn't happened yet.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.640]   And it turns out if you retired in 1974,
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.400]   which was inflation was bad, stock market was bad,
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.800]   you actually did okay.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.600]   And if you retired in '73, you barely made it.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.720]   There's one year difference,
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.840]   which can be a little unsettling, I suppose,
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.000]   but it seems to me that,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.600]   kind of like along what John had said,
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.920]   I really think it's important to continue to evaluate
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.600]   your spending and using whatever tools that you use,
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.720]   and there are plenty of great ones out there,
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.040]   including new retirement,
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.360]   but whatever tool you use to have an understanding of,
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.080]   based on Monte Carlo analysis simulations,
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.240]   how your retirement is looking as you move through it.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.080]   If, you know, it's difficult to come up with rules of thumb,
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.480]   but if you're actually calculating your withdrawal
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.000]   and determining what percentage of your portfolio
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.920]   you're taking out in a given year,
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.000]   even if you started at 4%,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.160]   you know, as inflation goes up
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.280]   and maybe the market goes down,
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.480]   you could be at 5% the next year or 6% or 7%.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.760]   And as you get into those numbers of six or 7%,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.400]   to me, that's when you should at least
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.040]   be taking a serious look at it.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.360]   Does it mean that we're in 1966
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.840]   and we're going straight down?
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.200]   No, but that's, to me, the six or 7% range
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.360]   is sort of the canary in the coal mine.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.200]   And I wanted to start taking a real look at my spending,
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.600]   and at least that's sort of my approach to it.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.680]   - Yeah, insofar as, hey, the market's down,
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.600]   should I spend less?
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.440]   How much less should I spend?
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   Well, you can get really geeky with this,
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.160]   or you can keep it really simple.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.440]   For example, on the really geeky front to give an example,
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.440]   Wade Pfau, again, he's done a lot of research on this,
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.520]   and he has a buffer asset strategy which says,
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.000]   hey, if the market's down,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.600]   instead of spending for my portfolio,
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.240]   I am going to take money out of home equity of my home,
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.000]   wait for the market to recover, pay it back.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.680]   And to determine whether it's the right time
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.080]   to do that or not, you have to project
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.520]   what your portfolio balance is gonna be over time, right?
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.040]   So that's a pretty geeky way to do it.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.960]   Alternatively, hey, the market's down,
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.880]   maybe this year I'm not gonna take that big vacation.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.280]   Maybe I'm gonna wait till next year to buy a new car.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.880]   Maybe I'm gonna wait till next year to do a home remodel.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.360]   So you don't necessarily have to take
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.640]   a really complicated approach to,
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.200]   hey, market's down, maybe I'll spend a little bit less.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.120]   - John, I wanna pick up on something you just said,
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.240]   which is the reverse mortgage idea.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.920]   There's been a fair amount of research in that space.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.680]   Alicia Manel, for example, has looked at how home equity
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.200]   is underutilized in a lot of households,
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.440]   where people are dying with a lot of housing wealth
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.760]   that might have improved their quality of lives.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   I'm wondering if the panel has any thoughts
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.840]   on the role of home equity
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.400]   potentially funding retirement needs.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.600]   And it seems like that's especially relevant
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.080]   for people who live in very high-cost places
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.960]   where their real estate assets
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.040]   have escalated in value very quickly.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:45.880]   Anyone?
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.720]   - Yeah, I mean, I think it's a huge factor.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.840]   Essentially for everyday Americans,
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.480]   half their wealth is in their house,
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.000]   and it's largely untapped.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.360]   So I think there is definitely a huge opportunity,
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.240]   and there's different ways you can do it.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.920]   I mean, in my family,
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.440]   my brother's essentially done a synthetic reverse mortgage
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.040]   by buying my mother's house in advance
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.160]   and then subsidizing it.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.640]   And between him and I, basically,
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.880]   he's gonna get that house, and that's how it works.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.720]   It's fine.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.960]   We did it inside the family.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.800]   Other families can't necessarily do that,
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.120]   but there are products.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.640]   The reverse mortgage has gotten, it has a bad reputation.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.480]   It's actually gotten highly regulated.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.440]   So the government's done, I think,
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.400]   a pretty good job of regulating out
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.680]   a lot of the negative features
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.400]   and making it a much more accessible product.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.680]   I'm actually curious if it'll start
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.920]   getting more widely adopted.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.480]   And for mainstream folks,
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.840]   because of what's happening in the equity markets right now,
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.080]   will people start to think more widely about that product?
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.640]   - So a couple of thoughts on this.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.680]   So insofar as the strategy,
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.520]   hey, access to that home equity,
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.800]   spend from it during those market drawdowns,
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.360]   that there is a component of insurance to this strategy.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.840]   That's to say, well, firstly,
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.800]   not all reverse mortgages are created equal.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.960]   The home equity conversion mortgage
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.880]   insured by the Federal Housing Administration,
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.720]   that is gonna be probably the best tool
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.960]   for accessing this strategy, for using this strategy,
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.680]   in that with this particular type of program,
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.320]   you pay a lump sum, and I wanna say it's five figures,
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.480]   for upfront insurance cost
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.080]   to the Federal Housing Administration,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.280]   and now you get to access a line of credit
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.120]   on your home.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.280]   So that's not a small feat,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.560]   but this is something you wanna consider
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.680]   as a risk management tool.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.320]   Is this necessarily gonna generate
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.400]   the greatest amount of wealth over your lifetime?
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.560]   Maybe not, but that's not why we're doing it.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.840]   We're doing it to manage risk,
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.040]   not necessarily to have the most money.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.600]   - Okay, so I have one more question
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.640]   that I definitely wanna ask,
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.720]   and then we wanna open it up for questions.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.360]   We'll put the mic in the middle of the room here.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.080]   So my question is about long-term care
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.000]   and how people should address the risk
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.040]   of long-term care in their plans.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.760]   We've all seen that the traditional
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   long-term care insurance market
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.880]   has been incredibly troubled.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.760]   So what's the solution?
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.160]   Who should self-fund long-term care?
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.240]   Who should purchase insurance?
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.520]   And what do you think of the hybrid-type products?
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.840]   - Yeah, I mean, definitely long-term care has a bad rap
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.600]   because the insurance companies
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.840]   wildly underpriced the product
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.960]   and then proceeded to jack up premiums on a lot of folks,
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.640]   and a lot of folks dropped their coverage,
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.680]   which is terrible.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.600]   And they then left the market.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.080]   Products are, I think, getting better,
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.960]   but it's, and I think it's, I mean,
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.120]   at a high level, it's like,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.280]   if you don't have a lot of money,
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.200]   you can just spend your assets down and go on Medicaid.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.800]   If you have a lot of money, you can self-insure.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.120]   If you're in the middle,
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.640]   that's where this product makes sense.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.200]   I do think the hybrid product's an interesting idea,
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.920]   but I don't have direct experience.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.000]   I think the idea of combining an annuity
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.680]   or potentially a death benefit
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.920]   with long-term care coverage makes sense,
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.840]   as long as you feel very confident
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.680]   that you understand the product, the pricing is good.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.920]   And I think you also have to understand
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.200]   that when you get this product,
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.920]   you have to pass a test around.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.280]   They're called ADLs, Activities of Daily Living.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.400]   And so, in the past, you could get this product
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.960]   and they could say, "Okay, well, actually, John,
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.200]   "it looks like you can dress yourself and bathe yourself,
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.760]   "so we're not gonna pay this benefit."
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.120]   You have to understand how that test is administered
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.760]   and how your rights for claiming the benefit.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.320]   - Yeah, going back to Insurance 101,
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.640]   again, this is a risk management tool.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.480]   On average, you buy insurance, you're gonna lose,
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.200]   but that's not why we buy it.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.800]   We buy it to manage risk.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.880]   Insofar as what products to buy,
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   now you've got the two options.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.000]   You've got plain vanilla insurance,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.440]   you've hit annual premium,
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.960]   and then you'll have a bucket of money
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.120]   that you'll be able to access.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.880]   You can qualify for benefits,
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.560]   those two of six daily living activities,
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.200]   or you have cognitive impairment.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.280]   That's simple, easy to understand,
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.840]   and then there's the more complicated financial product.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.400]   So earlier, I talked about, hey, if something's complicated,
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.160]   generally, you wanna run screaming from it,
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.240]   and that's gonna apply
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.600]   to these long-term care hybrid policies too.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.720]   Ideally, you wanna get that simple insurance product.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.120]   Those more complicated products
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.040]   are really only a last resort
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.040]   if you don't qualify 'cause of underwriting requirements
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.200]   for a more basic, simple insurance coverage.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.720]   And then if you are looking at that decision,
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:36.200]   I consider folks to take a lot of time to think about that.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.240]   Is this really the right product for you?
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.640]   And then in making that decision
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.320]   and in getting advice on that decision,
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.080]   figure out who's advising you on that.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.200]   That's to say, don't ask the insurance salesman
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.760]   if you should buy long-term care insurance.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.520]   Get advice from someone who has expertise in the area
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.720]   that doesn't have that conflict of interest.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.960]   - This is a practical point 'cause this is what we did.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.400]   The benefits for long-term care insurance
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.440]   are quite limited, I think.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.360]   I mean, they're gonna give you a dollar amount per day,
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.720]   maybe 100 bucks for a period of time.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.960]   And so what we did was said, okay,
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.000]   well, if we actually used up all of these benefits,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.640]   what would that number be?
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.640]   And can we self-insure?
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.120]   Now, of course, the answer to that may be yes, maybe no,
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.080]   but I would encourage you to at least do that math.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.800]   I can help inform the decision.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.560]   - One note, I just wanna add on that.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.800]   Certainly there's an argument for self-funding, right?
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.680]   Hey, you've got the money.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.640]   Maybe you don't need to buy insurance coverage.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.120]   Here's an argument I heard from an insurance salesman, right?
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.880]   So take this with a grain of salt with respect to,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.160]   even if you do have the resources
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.680]   to be able to afford that coverage yourself,
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.840]   consider when that day comes,
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   you might be inclined to not pay for professional services,
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.360]   trying to do some of that in-house yourself.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.360]   That's gonna be that survivor,
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.440]   or not the surviving spouse,
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.400]   but the spouse that's more abled, right?
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.880]   And how is that gonna impact their quality of life?
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.600]   So I can certainly see the argument there,
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.320]   but of course, again, that's also the argument
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.160]   being made by an insurance salesman.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.800]   - I have a follow-up question on that,
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.200]   and I just want to reiterate.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.600]   We do have a mic here in the middle.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.640]   If people have questions, feel free to queue up.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.480]   I wanted to ask about the people
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.800]   who might have life insurance,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.320]   and whether that can, in some cases,
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.280]   be transferred or switched into a product,
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.000]   a hybrid product that covers long-term care.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.920]   I know that sometimes that can be an elegant solution
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.080]   if someone has some sort
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.320]   of a permanent life insurance product.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.160]   John, you're nodding.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.960]   Can you talk about that?
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.040]   - Yeah, I've only ever actually been remotely involved
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.160]   in helping the client with this once,
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.120]   but if the question is, hey, I'm gonna pay five grand a year
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.640]   to buy a new Span-and-Loan policy,
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.960]   or if I can take an existing whole-life insurance policy
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.000]   and then change that into an existing
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.040]   whole-life insurance policy with a long-term care writer,
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.760]   certainly that can be more cost-effective
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.120]   than shoveling out five grand a year, every year forever.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.280]   - So, a follow-up question on the topic of long-term care.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.080]   I'm guessing a lot of people in this room
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.160]   probably fall into the self-funding category,
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.920]   where they've probably amassed sufficient assets
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.520]   where they feel that they could absorb
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.160]   a long-term care shock.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.400]   So, a question on that front is,
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.440]   how do those funds get invested,
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.080]   assuming they're earmarked for long-term care,
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:36.240]   and also, how do you right-size that allocation
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.600]   that you're setting aside, or do you even need to?
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.240]   How should people approach that
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.640]   if they're in the self-funding camp?
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.760]   And, Rob, maybe, since this is your approach,
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.640]   maybe you should grab it.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.880]   - That's an interesting question.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.080]   I haven't thought about whether I should change
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.880]   my asset allocation in the event
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.440]   that we have to spend a lot on care.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.280]   I've certainly factored it into potential expenses,
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.760]   and we can cover it.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.800]   At least off the top of my head,
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.720]   I don't see asset allocation changing.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.160]   I mean, I suppose, in theory,
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.840]   you could earmark some amount of money
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.520]   that says, okay, we're gonna put this aside,
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.960]   eventually, for long-term care, if that ever happened.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.880]   But even then, it would be a tricky allocation,
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.720]   because you don't know when it's gonna happen.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.320]   Could be tomorrow, or it could be 20 years from now.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.240]   So, I think, for me, I would probably just stick
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.440]   with my overall asset allocation.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.560]   Yeah, and then just know that I've got the assets
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.640]   to cover it, if that should come up.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:37.400]   - I wanna ask about the bucket approach
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.800]   to retirement allocation.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.280]   We had a good conversation about this at lunch,
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.920]   and I'd just like to get the panel's thoughts.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.720]   Maybe you can each address the question
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.080]   of whether you think it's something people should use,
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.800]   whether you think they should avoid it.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.600]   Whoever wants to jump on that one.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.000]   - I mean, I think that, if you, like, back to Carson Jeske,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.280]   he definitely believes that it's inefficient,
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.920]   and you should just stay completely invested,
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.480]   and ride it out, and so forth, but--
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.200]   - The bucket strategy is--
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.400]   - The bucket strategy, okay, sure, yeah.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   I mean, basically, what you're doing
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   is you're setting aside a bucket of money
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.440]   for near-term expenses, some period of time.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.120]   It could be a year, it could be two or three,
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.120]   or, in this other guy's case, four years,
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.920]   which is a pretty long time.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.720]   And so, you're not getting any market returns on that money,
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.520]   but you're sleeping better at night.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.360]   So, it's a drag, essentially, on your portfolio.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.760]   But I think, from a simplicity, and behavior,
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.720]   and psychological perspective, it really works,
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.240]   'cause people are like, okay, I have a set of money,
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.000]   it's like my checking account, I can live on this,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.120]   essentially, they're creating a paycheck,
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.880]   like a potentially year-long paycheck, all at once,
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.040]   timing when they take that out, which they can control.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.600]   So, if you load it up for 2022, at the end of 2021,
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.880]   or whatever, the latter half, you'd be good to go,
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.720]   and you're feeling like a genius.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:57.000]   And so, some folks do do this, and if they stay active,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.840]   and they have a long period of time,
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.680]   I mean, they sleep well at night, and it works for them.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.120]   But it may not be the absolute perfect performer over time,
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.640]   but maybe you're dealing with a lot of stress,
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.840]   because you're trying to manage that,
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.600]   and it's somewhat complicated, too.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.480]   - Yeah, pros and cons to any investing approach,
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.000]   the strategy you can stick with is likely better
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.200]   than the one that you can't.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.360]   If a bucket strategy sounds great to you,
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.080]   then certainly that can be reasonable.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.000]   Now, cons being, you're gonna have that cash drag,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.720]   so maybe that means you're gonna have
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.600]   a smaller investment return, and likely that'll be the case
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.800]   on a long-term timeline, 'cause cash, historically,
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.080]   hasn't done as well as intermediate-term bonds
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.120]   over the long-term.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.720]   But again, that's less important than as a strategy
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.840]   that you can stick with, and if that's the one
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.160]   that sounds appealing to you,
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.080]   then certainly that can be reasonable.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.680]   - So, there's a lot here, but I won't go into all of it,
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.680]   'cause of time.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.600]   I think there's different issues with the bucket strategy,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.680]   and why you wanna use it.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.880]   If the question is, you wanna keep a certain amount of cash
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.320]   because you wanna feel comfortable, then that's fine,
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.760]   right, I mean, as long as it's not too much.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.040]   And whether you call that a bucket strategy or not,
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.520]   or it's just money in your checking account,
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.080]   and then you've got your portfolio over here,
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.320]   that was sort of the father of the bucket strategy,
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.400]   Harold Levinsky, that was his idea, two buckets,
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.560]   one for cash, he started at two years,
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.040]   it was too big of a drag on the portfolio,
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.920]   so he ended up taking clients down to one year,
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.680]   which, by the way, is what Bill Behnken did, right,
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.080]   he pulled a year's worth of income out of,
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.280]   in his assumption, his analysis model,
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.880]   so really not much different than that,
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.080]   and I think that's a certainly reasonable approach.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.280]   I think where I have trouble with it is if we start
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.080]   to have multiple buckets, and we start to do
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.280]   our asset allocation by years of expenses
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.000]   rather than percentages, which is how I started
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.160]   to think about it when I got into the retirement phase,
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.800]   and for me personally, I just found that harder
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.760]   to actually implement, to know when to go
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.880]   from one bucket to another, it was just easier for me
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.120]   to have whatever cash I wanted, and then, you know,
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.000]   a 70/30 portfolio, or whatever it's gonna be.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.320]   But others might find the bucket strategy easier,
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.560]   you know, there might be just the opposite,
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.680]   so a lot of it just comes down to personal preference,
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.320]   but I would always think about, even if you use
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.880]   a bucket strategy, what is your percentage asset allocation?
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.360]   I wouldn't lose sight of that if you're gonna go
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.240]   with the three or even more complicated bucket strategy.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.360]   - Okay, hi.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.880]   I've read, actually, it was a Michael Kitsy's article,
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.200]   that there's a possibility that you could look at annuity
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.760]   as part of your fixed income asset portfolio,
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.560]   not to annotize it, you know, you'd sell it afterwards,
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   but as a good source of income, in terms of,
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.840]   you know, comparatively, I'd be interested
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.440]   to hear what your thoughts are.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.480]   - Yeah, there's a guy, he's V. Bodie,
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.560]   that I know, he's an economist,
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.960]   and he talks about life cycle finance,
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.600]   and so one way you can think about your portfolio
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.160]   is you think about your expenses,
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.960]   and what do you have to spend, just your needs,
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.440]   and then your likes, and then your wants,
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.320]   and if you cover your needs
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.120]   with Social Security and annuities,
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.440]   then theoretically, you can take more risk
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.120]   with the rest of your portfolio.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:07.800]   So that is one strategy, is you basically try to hedge out,
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.040]   you know, the stuff that you have to have,
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.040]   make sure you're fully covered,
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.880]   and then you dial up the risk and the rest of it,
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.240]   and you know, hopefully you get very good long run returns.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:21.480]   - Yeah, that's certainly an approach
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.760]   that I think a lot of people follow.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.200]   You do have to do the calculation,
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.280]   and I can, you know, there's some assumptions in terms,
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.760]   including the discount rate to figure out present value,
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.080]   so that can just get a little dicey,
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.480]   but the thing I would say, though,
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.000]   is I would still look at how much I need
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.680]   to pull out of my portfolio
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.520]   after the annuity check comes in,
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:45.040]   and what percentage of my portfolio is that,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.080]   and what is my asset allocation of that portfolio
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.640]   without considering the annuity.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.880]   I personally feel more comfortable
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.080]   running through that analysis,
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.560]   at least as part of the process,
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.000]   even if, for your overall asset allocation,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.760]   you wanna view an annuity as part of the bond portfolio,
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.440]   which is certainly a reasonable and logical,
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.520]   I think, thing to do,
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.320]   but I would still wanna know, you know,
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.920]   'cause if I'm pulling 4% out of just the portfolio,
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.320]   and because I'm considering the annuity
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.960]   as part of fixed income, I have some allocation
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.160]   that's, say, outside 50 to 75% in stocks,
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.480]   which maybe you wouldn't,
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.280]   but if it was outside that range,
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.000]   it would at least be something I'd wanna think about.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.920]   You know, am I too far outside that range
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.200]   that at least history tells us,
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.280]   could be wrong in the future,
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.400]   but history tells us is the range we wanna have,
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.680]   you know, if we're somewhere around
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.440]   that initial 4% withdrawal rate.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.400]   At least, that's how I think about it.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:44.240]   - Oh, hi.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.560]   My question touches on several topics you brought forward,
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.560]   so just what a great panel.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:55.120]   We've all thought about the 4% rule,
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.240]   and several of you mentioned how many of us
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.840]   are in the position of having at least,
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.960]   well, mine is about half of my overall wealth
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.160]   is in my house, and I'm really loathe
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.960]   to take out a reverse mortgage.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.520]   They've had such terrible,
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.360]   I really don't wanna do that,
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:18.640]   but my question is this, as, I have to laugh,
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:22.320]   I'm so far ahead of the 4% with my withdrawal
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.200]   just for living expenses that, you know,
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.640]   I don't have to calculate that to see where I am.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.160]   It's way above that.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:34.800]   As my portfolio's going down, both because of withdrawals,
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.680]   and because of this last year,
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.160]   my house value is skyrocketing,
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.760]   and I still have a big mortgage.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.560]   So, my question is, do you think
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.720]   a home equity line of credit would be useful
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.720]   so that I could, in effect, increase my mortgage temporarily
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.840]   borrowing money, admittedly, a line of credit
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:01.840]   is at a higher rate than a traditional mortgage.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.520]   Do you think that would be advisable,
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.720]   sort of hoping, waiting for the market to turn around
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.840]   so that then I can start repaying that mortgage
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.160]   and the line of credit?
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.920]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.520]   I mean, if you ask Wade Fowler,
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.840]   that's basically what he's saying.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.920]   He's saying either through a HELOC or with a HECM,
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.440]   which is a home equity, it's basically a reverse mortgage,
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.960]   it's a government-backed version.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.480]   You can also get a line of credit
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.240]   to make that available to yourself,
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.360]   and then potentially engage in that.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.280]   And essentially, you could draw from that
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.440]   to cover your expenses instead of selling off
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.920]   of your depressed portfolio.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.840]   And then you're waiting, essentially,
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.200]   for the market to recover.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   So you have to have confidence and the patience
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.100]   to wait for the market to come back.
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.840]   And that comes back to kind of the emotional side
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.040]   of managing your own behavior
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.680]   and feeling like you've got enough of a window
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.520]   for this to come back.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.120]   I mean, I think we've gotten conditioned
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.000]   to markets coming back really quickly,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.160]   and now we'll see.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.800]   I mean, personally, well, I won't give my opinion on this,
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.120]   but yeah, I think it's a potential strategy,
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.840]   but you really should consider forecasting it out
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.440]   over the long-term horizon.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:21.080]   - Yeah, so I'm very nervous about this.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.960]   This strategy gives me the heebie-jeebies,
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.880]   if I'm gonna, you know, that's a very technical term.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.840]   So, because first of all, you're borrowing to invest,
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.160]   which is effectively what you're doing.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.260]   Now, some could say you're doing that
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.700]   if you don't pay off a mortgage,
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.000]   but you're doing it while in retirement,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.920]   not when you're 30 and are working and have income,
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.320]   you know, earned income.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.280]   And if it's a home equity line of credit,
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.480]   you're subjecting that to interest rate risk, right?
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.160]   If interest rates keep going up.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.840]   So to me, that would be, for me,
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.120]   would be like the option of maybe last resort.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.840]   That would make me very uncomfortable.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.080]   I would think more about, depending on the circumstances,
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.560]   downsizing even, maybe you don't wanna leave the home,
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.360]   I know, or maybe you're already downsized or, you know.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.880]   But for me, that would make me very uncomfortable
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.200]   to start borrowing out of a home equity line of credit
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.520]   so that I could keep more money
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.840]   in the market in retirement.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.720]   That would, I think it could work out,
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.960]   but it could also end pretty badly, I think.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.860]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:28.720]   - Hi, I'm Vijay from Ann Arbor, Michigan,
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.760]   planning to retire in five to seven years.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.560]   Question for Steve.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.640]   Steve, I used New Retirement, fantastic tool,
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:42.800]   but maybe I'm lazy and ignorant.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.720]   I'm unable to use the full potential of the tool.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.400]   But however, Rob Berger made a video
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:54.400]   and I'm able to use the tool as far as, you know,
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.480]   by following Rob Berger's video.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.520]   So my question is, are you guys going to collaborate
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.880]   and make a few more of those
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.340]   so that people like me can benefit?
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:07.200]   - Yeah, thanks for the feedback.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.440]   It's a team effort.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.160]   I would say we started it with power planners
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.560]   and that's informed what the product does.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.840]   And we are working very hard to make it simpler
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.860]   and easier and more accessible.
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.720]   You know, we're building our own health and classes
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:31.120]   and we believe in, we're really here to try to, you know,
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.760]   bring literacy and planning to the mass market.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.080]   That's why we've built kind of like TurboTax equivalent
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.960]   and price it in a low cost way.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.320]   But yeah, there's a ton to learn.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.280]   There's a ton of, there's a million edge cases,
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.000]   a million edge cases.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:43.920]   That's why it's such a hard problem
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.840]   and no one's really solved it.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.560]   And yeah, no, I mean, I appreciate that Rob
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:50.960]   has building videos to make it more understandable.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.920]   So thank you very much for doing that.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:01.840]   - Well, in my case, my wife is the brains in the family
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.600]   and I don't know if there's any correlation,
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.960]   but she has no interest in this financial stuff.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:08.800]   Okay.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.420]   Let's assume that we have plenty of money.
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:16.380]   We're not any risk of being near the edge.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:22.320]   She currently has an IRA that has maybe 10% of our assets
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.520]   and she's got a financial advisor for that.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.080]   If I kick the bucket, I know exactly what's gonna happen
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.640]   and I don't want that to happen.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.260]   He's gonna suddenly have 10 times as much money.
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:38.720]   I'm wondering if you guys have any suggestions
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.120]   that actually work on how to do this transition
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:47.360]   other than simplifying as much as I possibly can.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.260]   Are there any other techniques or anything else
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:55.260]   that you can suggest so that if I pass away first,
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.220]   that she has some other alternative
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:01.340]   to a 1% charge on our assets?
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.580]   - Yeah, so first things first,
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:04.640]   if you haven't done this already,
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.520]   make sure you've got all those estate planning documents
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.360]   in place, right?
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.500]   Will, trust, power of attorney.
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.460]   And then, so that's the formal estate planning stuff.
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:14.740]   And then it sounds like you also have a big need
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.420]   for an informal estate planning document,
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.980]   which goes by many names,
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.980]   emergency letter, side letter of instruction.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.340]   And what you're gonna do is you're gonna list out
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.300]   everything that's not listed out in the wills
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.120]   of trust and everything else,
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.660]   which is to say, "Honey, here's the name
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:29.820]   "of our estate attorney.
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.840]   "Here's the name of our tax preparer.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.880]   "Here's where all our accounts are
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.580]   "and how to access them."
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.420]   - She got all that.
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.900]   That's not the problem. - Okay, beautiful, perfect.
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:41.980]   So it sounds like we have a need for a financial advisor
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.340]   who's gonna do the asset management or maybe an asset--
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.660]   - He's a great guy.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.820]   - Yeah, exactly, yeah.
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.500]   Yeah, that is the issue.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.200]   So, gosh.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:57.180]   So the relationship component aside,
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:00.420]   'cause that's a whole another can of worms,
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.540]   we need someone to manage the portfolio in your absence.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:08.500]   So it sounds like if you want to go the portfolio route,
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.060]   then possibly transitioning now
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:15.180]   to a more competitively priced asset manager via--
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:16.620]   - Like Vanguard or something like that?
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:17.460]   - Yeah.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:18.860]   - A company that starts with V, sorry.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:19.700]   - Yep, yeah, no.
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.620]   Like, that's fine, or a flat fee, right?
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.700]   You wanna find a flat fee asset manager,
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.780]   you're gonna know exactly how much you're paying
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.380]   to the dollar, and that can help you decide
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.340]   if that's a reasonable price to pay.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.580]   So taking those actions now, and again,
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.960]   that's gonna be, oh, looks like, okay.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.780]   - Quickly.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.820]   - Yeah, just real quick, I think I agree with John.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.180]   I mean, there's a definite movement now
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:46.620]   for flat fee, fee-only advice, and it exists out there.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.100]   And if you frame it up for your wife or your family
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.740]   to say, okay, well, at 1%, it's 20,000 a year, right?
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.620]   Or what the number is, and what does that buy?
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:00.620]   And would you rather pay your friend here 20 grand
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.620]   or give it to the grandkids or fund college
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:04.460]   or something like that?
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.860]   I mean, you frame up the alternative,
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.160]   but there's definitely, you should be able to find
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.660]   a fiduciary advisor you can play on an hourly basis,
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.900]   just like you pay a CPA, right, or a lawyer.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.580]   So I would look more widely and try
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.380]   to have that discussion now.
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:18.480]   I agree with the risk.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.260]   - Thanks.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.460]   So super quick, I know we talked about the 4% rule.
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.100]   Bill Bangan, we're gonna have Bill Bangan
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.240]   on the Bogleheads live show this December.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.620]   So if you want to ask Bill Bangan, father of the 4% rule,
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:32.360]   maybe now the 4.5% rule, your questions,
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.340]   make sure to check that out.
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:36.180]   You can follow the Bogleheads on Twitter for dates and times.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.540]   - Thank you.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.300]   - So thank you so much, Rob, John, Steve.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.060]   Thanks for being here.
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.180]   We're going to take a 10-minute break,
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.140]   or I guess like eight minutes now,
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.300]   and we will reconvene in this room.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.880]   Rick Ferry will be interviewing Dr. Burton Malkiel.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.720]   Thank you.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.880]   (audience applauding)
