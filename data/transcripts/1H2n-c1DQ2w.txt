[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.680]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers?
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.180]   Today, we're talking about the journey
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.900]   of starting up your own podcast
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.820]   and why you want to do this content creator life.
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.080]   Joining us is Andrew Cappell.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.720]   Andrew, how are you doing?
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.560]   - Thanks, Tim.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.380]   It is great to be here and we're on this journey together.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.800]   Tim and I got virtually connected
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.920]   through my sister, Jennifer Cappell.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.440]   Must have been about almost six months ago now.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.840]   And when Jen heard that I was starting a podcast,
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.320]   I think she saw some of the design and the creative
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.180]   and the logo that I designed in Canva in about 30 seconds,
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.440]   and she was horrified.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.320]   So she said, "Go look at Tim's stuff.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.880]   "Maybe connect with him, maybe he'll talk with you."
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.360]   And so we started virtually chatting
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.800]   and we've been able to keep in touch.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.640]   And now we're still working on it almost a year later.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.020]   And so it's really fun.
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.960]   Tim and I hadn't had a chance to speak
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.000]   because we're both doing the podcast
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.640]   as a nights and weekends and lunchtime thing.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.760]   And so, yeah, we didn't really have,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.440]   we weren't just sitting around
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.760]   just hanging out all the time.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.400]   But now we're, six months later,
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.280]   we're talking and I'm really excited to be here.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.520]   - Yeah, you know, we totally bootstrapped this thing.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.120]   You know, it's funny for me.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.080]   If I had not gotten laid off at the right time,
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.900]   I would never have afforded my time to do this.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.200]   'Cause I've always told myself, I was like,
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.680]   "You know what, like in the back half of my career,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.040]   "maybe the last 10 or 15 years,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.120]   "what do I want to be doing?"
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.560]   And ideally it's something that maybe
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.300]   is less dependent on income and more passion driven.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.880]   I was like, doing something like a podcast
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.240]   would be something that fit that ilk,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.600]   but always been too busy, didn't have time to do that.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.980]   So at least for me personally,
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.600]   maybe I'm just bad at time management.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.160]   Like there's no way it would have gotten us off the ground.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.120]   Like, so what really propelled you
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.840]   to want to even do podcasts?
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.320]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.640]   So I've definitely been a consumer of podcasts
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.560]   for about a decade.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.640]   I had a short stint at an early stage startup
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.120]   called Sprout Connections.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.500]   This was back in 2016.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.280]   And the mission of that company,
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.120]   it was started by an entrepreneur,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.200]   was to connect podcasters with their audience.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.320]   'Cause it's still the same,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.040]   but when you have a podcast,
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.320]   you don't really know who is listening.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.120]   You get anecdotal feedback.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.320]   Some people, it's a lot of friends and family at the start,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.840]   but you don't know who your audience is.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.520]   And you can see the metrics, but they're anonymized.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.640]   And I attribute it to Apple,
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.120]   is a privacy centric organization.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.680]   They just don't give any visibility to the podcasters.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.520]   So this was a problem.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.160]   And I was doing business development
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.000]   at this startup a long time ago.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.360]   And I tried to actually start a podcast back then,
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.480]   and I just couldn't get it off the ground.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.120]   And so it always been of interest,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.200]   but I had a little bit of extra time last summer
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.080]   and just decided that I was gonna try to make it happen.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.020]   And it was a lot of work.
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.600]   Now that it's running, it is a little bit less work.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.720]   It still is a lot of work,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.680]   but I'm really glad that I got it off the ground.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   So how did you choose your topic and your audience?
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.320]   And I'll use myself as an example.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.440]   So for me, a personal passion of mine is just like mentorship
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.840]   and just helping people advance careers
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.160]   or just create more economic opportunity
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.040]   for themselves, right?
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.440]   And for me also, I have two young girls.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.280]   So part of it is like,
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.640]   hey, anything I can do to help women advance,
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   especially in high tech,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.420]   'cause there absolutely is a ceiling,
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.700]   even though we're making progress.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.600]   It's like, how can I lead the world a little better
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.280]   than how I found it?
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.080]   And so I found that doing my one-on-ones
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.800]   wasn't necessarily scalable.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.000]   And so that was my point of view.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.520]   I was like, hey, maybe I can create this podcasting
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.280]   where at that time I was unemployed.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.660]   And I was like, if I can create a resource for people
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.120]   who are either in the market
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.400]   or maybe they're in a role that's currently being minimized,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.240]   like it was really rough for recruiters and HRs, 2000, 2002,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.000]   maybe I can help them realize
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.180]   that the skillsets they have really apply to any industry.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.760]   They just need to know what the industry is about.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.720]   So that was kind of my point of view.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.440]   What was your equivalent of arriving at what the topic was?
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.280]   - Sure, sure.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.120]   So I have a story.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.180]   So I have a background in sales.
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.760]   And after college,
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.080]   I worked in the sports industry for a brief stint.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.540]   The sports industry is great entertainment sports.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.120]   It's not the best place to be in sales, in my opinion.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.640]   And so I went from the sports industry
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.280]   to the events industry, the B2B events industry,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.520]   which was a great place to be,
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.400]   but not really on the tip of innovation.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.600]   And so after three years in the event industry,
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.880]   I attended dozens of trade shows.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.720]   I went to Las Vegas 10 times in about two and a half years.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.240]   It was fun, but it wasn't where I wanted to be long-term.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.640]   And so I joined that early, early stage startup,
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.840]   which was too early for me.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.720]   And I exited that,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.720]   but I realized that I wanted to attach my career
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.800]   to an emerging industry.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.700]   And so I actually found,
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.400]   I was living in Stanford, Connecticut,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.480]   outside of New York City.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.440]   And I found a company that was a combination
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.400]   of cybersecurity and data analytics.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.960]   And so cybersecurity, as you know, Tim,
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.480]   is a great industry to be in.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.420]   And then data analytics is another good one.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.240]   And so we did encryption and tokenization.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.680]   So de-identified social security numbers
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.600]   and put those in an anonymized place in the database.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.680]   So that way, if there was a breach,
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.840]   nothing bad would happen.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.240]   And so I had a start at this company.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.280]   I took a couple of steps back in my career, back in 2016.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.300]   I had been a closer.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.720]   I'd brought in a million dollars revenue,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.100]   but I had to start as an entry-level BDR.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.080]   And it was really hard.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.400]   I spent way too much time with the CTO
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.680]   and our technology team, trying to learn the technology.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.960]   And that did not make me a good cold caller
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.120]   or effective business development person.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.880]   And it wasn't, so I was there for about six months,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.800]   not producing, really questioning myself.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.320]   And it was something called Ring the Bell,
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.800]   where when our leaders and our sales team
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.960]   would close a big deal,
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.800]   that it would close a deal with Aflac,
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.880]   Citibank, ADP, Blue Cross Blue Shield,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.760]   some of the biggest, most well-known brands in the world,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.240]   they would be an all-company email.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.040]   This is before Slacker Teams,
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.780]   and it was called Ring the Bell.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.840]   And so they would explain the narrative
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.760]   of how the deal happened,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.400]   how it got started, what the challenges were,
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.120]   what went well, what didn't,
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.480]   what partners were involved, and then what's next,
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.800]   why the customer bought, and what they're looking to do,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.320]   and how we're gonna help deliver that.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.880]   And as a new salesperson,
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.800]   this was just so much more impactful,
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.060]   no offense to the marketing team,
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.560]   but more impactful than the marketing materials,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.080]   than reading the website, than reading the white papers,
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.260]   or trying to memorize all that,
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.480]   because the customer, especially at the executive level,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.440]   they just don't care.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.900]   And so you need to have the narrative and the soundbites.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.480]   And it was these emails that were so valuable to me
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.600]   that I, literally, I became a consultant
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.200]   a few years after Protegra Day.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.600]   I was there for five years.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.200]   And I couldn't believe that not everyone
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.600]   was doing this Ring the Bell thing.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.200]   So it always stuck in my head,
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.880]   and I would actually implement it at some clients.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.080]   And so they always liked it.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.000]   It was always good for morale and learning.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.680]   But it wasn't out there in the world,
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.040]   and so I had a little bit of time,
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.600]   and I said, "Hey, I'm gonna take this concept,"
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.340]   which was so impactful to me and my career and my learning,
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.900]   and try to democratize it
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.260]   and bring it to the world through a podcast.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.840]   - Dude, I love that.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.580]   And no offense taken, that sounds like a wonderful value,
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.540]   something that marketing can't bring to the table,
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.060]   sharing the wins and the goodness and insights
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.780]   around how you bring customers in, how you close it,
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.300]   how you lose deals, too, right?
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.100]   All that is valuable input.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.700]   I really like that.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.720]   So let's go day zero.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.020]   So you've kind of, you come in with an idea
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.660]   of what you want, similar to me, I kind of had an idea.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.860]   You talked about leveraging your friends
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.420]   and social network to kind of validate your ideas.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.380]   What did that look like to you?
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.220]   'Cause for me, it was like, I had an idea of what I wanted.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.140]   I had a group of Facebook friends and family friends
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.880]   I just rapidly texted, and I was like,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.740]   "Hey, here's some ideas," and I threw out some names.
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.300]   'Cause I was struggling with, what am I trying to do?
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.900]   How can I conceptualize it in a name?
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.740]   But all these terrible names.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.220]   And the one I really liked going into the exercise
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.140]   was called the Careers Reimagined.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.620]   I was like, "Hey, maybe the idea is my persona
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.780]   "or my target audience is someone
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.240]   "who is at a pivot point in the career,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.540]   "and so maybe it's about reimagining your careers."
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.140]   And I had all these other things,
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.500]   and I literally created a poll and I sent it,
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.260]   like a survey monkey, I sent it all to my friends,
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.020]   and it was quickly shot down.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.540]   And it was like, that was my first negative response
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.260]   to ideas.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.500]   What was your first reaction with your peer group
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:40.500]   who saw your ideas, or even your initial ideation ideas?
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.540]   Was that well-received?
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.820]   Did you get critical feedback?
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.460]   What did it look like to you?
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.140]   - Yeah, it took a long time to bring it to market.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.820]   I couldn't find anything else out there like it,
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.660]   so it's either, "Hey, this is a great idea,"
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.760]   or, "This is a terrible idea,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.460]   "and I'm not thinking about why it won't work."
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.240]   And what I did was I jotted it down.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.880]   I'm a visual learner.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.700]   I used Microsoft OneNote, and then Mylanote,
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.860]   and then Miro, and Lucidchart,
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.140]   and I sort of mapped out the concepts of how it worked.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.700]   And I was fortunate that I had been at this company,
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.220]   Ring the Bell was a structured template,
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.460]   and it's already working,
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.380]   and so I mapped it out as to how it would be in a podcast,
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.460]   quick hitter, 10 or 15 minutes,
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.620]   and I shared it with a couple of folks.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.260]   They gave me some feedback, mostly lukewarm feedback,
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.120]   but I shared it with one entrepreneur,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.560]   the founder of a startup called OrgChart Hub,
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.680]   and Dan Curran is his name,
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.320]   and we had chatted a couple of times
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.400]   'cause I thought his application was really cool.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.200]   You imagine an org chart for the roles and responsibilities
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.840]   and the hierarchy of an organization,
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.760]   but when you're doing a complex deal, that is table stakes.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.220]   It's really important for the sales team
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.160]   to understand the org chart,
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.240]   to understand the executive priorities,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.960]   the departmental priorities,
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.980]   and to weave in those care abouts
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.680]   of the different parts of the organization
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.520]   into your solution
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.300]   and how you're gonna help solve those problems.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:11.300]   So they created an app that's native to the HubSpot CRM,
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.620]   and it allows you to visualize the CRM,
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.500]   and so that's really important with big deals.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.780]   We used versions of that.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.500]   We actually called them mud maps,
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.180]   and so you take an org chart, you mark it up,
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.620]   you put a lot of comments, and we did it in PowerPoint,
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.540]   and I created some cool templates in PowerPoint,
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.620]   but it wasn't connected to anything.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.040]   And so I actually pitched this idea to Dan,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.380]   and he thought it was cool.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.460]   He thought it was clever,
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.820]   but we didn't really go anywhere with it,
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.620]   and then he must've had a conversation with his co-founder,
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.400]   and they must've given it a thumbs up,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.500]   and Dan came back and said,
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.100]   "Hey, we'd love to help with this podcast."
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.620]   And I said, "All right, not really sure what you mean,"
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.700]   but what that meant was he was the first guest,
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.500]   and so he agreed to be a guest of the podcast.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.740]   It almost didn't get off the ground
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.660]   because we had recording issues.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.260]   He's over in the UK,
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.300]   and the transatlantic underground internet fiber cable
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.980]   must've been a little bit looser or rickety,
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.940]   and so when we recorded our first podcast,
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.040]   there was, I'm not kidding,
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.100]   there was a three-second delay
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.180]   between when I would talk and when Dan would talk.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.140]   So he just thought I was the worst podcaster ever.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.460]   He's like, "You know, it's a conversation,
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.500]   "not just like a pause and dialogue."
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.300]   So the Wi-Fi challenges, which still happen to this day,
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.620]   it really gave me, it shook my confidence as a podcaster,
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.360]   and I was like, "This is hard.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.180]   "I'm gonna go back to the listening."
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.240]   But fortunately, we re-recorded, and that went well.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.500]   I actually was working with a recent graduate
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.980]   from University of Connecticut.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.420]   His name is Brett Muni.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.380]   He was in the UConn Student Consulting Group,
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.780]   and we had met at an alumni event,
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.580]   and he was very creative.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.580]   He would edit and produce his own videos,
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.740]   and he showed me, he was interested in some of the work
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.260]   that I was doing at a video production company,
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.880]   and that didn't work out long-term,
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.340]   but Brett and I stayed in touch,
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.620]   and when I told him about this podcast concept and idea,
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.640]   he was pretty excited about the creative project,
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.780]   and he joined me to help edit the podcast,
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.580]   which is so helpful because that is also a lot of work.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.660]   So I had a partner.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.620]   We got the first couple episodes launched.
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.900]   I still didn't have a ton of confidence,
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.180]   and I had reached out to a really big name,
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.420]   really well-respected name in the B2B sales world.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.420]   His name is Evan Kelsay.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.300]   He had closed a single software deal for over $30 million,
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.500]   and just as a little bit of napkin math,
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.900]   I know that the public markets
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.220]   and the private valuation markets
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.540]   are different than they were in the past,
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.980]   but if you said that an individual deal is worth,
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.660]   the value of the company is 10x the revenue of the deal,
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.220]   so a $300 million deal, $30 million deal
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.860]   is actually worth $300 million
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.240]   for the valuation of the company.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.140]   It's a really big deal,
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.380]   and he agreed to come on the podcast before it had launched.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.140]   So that also told me that I needed to keep going,
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.900]   and that helped to give me a little bit of a milestone
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.740]   to not give up before it got off the ground.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.060]   - So how was that final stretch for you
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.740]   like just before you launch a podcast?
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.100]   'Cause you gotta figure out the name.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.260]   You gotta figure out look and feel.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.900]   You gotta get your run of show, equipment.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.740]   What was that last,
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.380]   the last 5% almost killed me, by the way.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.360]   So what was it like for you?
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.960]   - Yeah, you know what, hold on.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.680]   So there was a lot of,
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.800]   so many articles and guides and best practices,
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.280]   and I don't wanna be dragging marketing,
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.280]   but I also realized after doing it
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.460]   and after getting to 10 episodes
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.960]   that most of those articles were actually SEO bait,
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.420]   and they were just trying to give
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.560]   published guides and resources.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.840]   And yeah, I read them,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.440]   but it didn't give me more confidence and simplicity
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.000]   to just get it out the door.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.740]   So the first 20 episodes of the podcast,
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.400]   I actually used this headset
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.160]   that I used to use as a sales rep
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.800]   to make phone calls and phone calls.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.000]   Finally, Brett, my editor and producer,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.400]   he said, "A lot of your guests,
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.600]   "you're bringing on some big guests.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.880]   "They have professional microphones.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.880]   "You need to level up."
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.320]   So I got an Audios Technica and now I'm leveled up.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.800]   But there's so many resources
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.480]   about all the stuff that you need,
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.880]   when in reality, it's really pretty basic.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.720]   You have an outline,
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.000]   you have some guests that will work with you
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.320]   through the, you know, as you're getting started,
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   and you just have to have the confidence
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.520]   or the conviction to ship it before it's perfect.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.520]   - Yeah, my last 5% really, really almost
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.020]   made me quit this whole thing.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.960]   Because like coming from a marketer,
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   I'm thinking about persona, audience,
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.560]   what impression or sentiment
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.460]   do I wanna leave on people?
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.460]   So it went down to like, I settled on a name.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.920]   And by the way, the naming piece
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.320]   was also kind of a gut-wrenching,
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.400]   eye-opening experience as well.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.960]   'Cause I'd fallen in love with recurring as imagined.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.920]   And I kinda like you, I brought in a friend
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.800]   who I previously worked with.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.640]   He still works with me now.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.800]   He actually does my post-production work.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.600]   But he kicked out all of these like icons and logos.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.960]   I was like, "Hey, look, here's an idea of a icon,
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.520]   "a cartoonish style they wanted.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.600]   "It's kind of fun and friendly."
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.760]   I was looking at like Joe Rogan
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.240]   and all of their kind of icon.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.280]   I did all these icon studies.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.200]   And then I sat down with my friend who,
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.560]   I solicited for feedback.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.880]   He was like, "I'm not feeling this careers
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.880]   "and re-imagined thing."
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.720]   I was like, "Why?"
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.320]   He's like, "Well, who's your target audience?"
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.960]   I was like, "Well, I'm going for people
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.120]   "who are maybe laid off or unemployed and blah, blah, blah."
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.840]   And he's like, "Careers imagined to him felt too limited."
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.920]   So if you're gonna focus just on the audience
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.080]   who's unemployed, why not just focus everyone?
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.640]   'Cause everyone is kind of job-seeking.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.280]   I was like, "Oh, shoot, you're totally right."
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.040]   And that made me realize that name itself was then limiting
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.000]   'cause not everyone is re-imagining a career, right?
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.680]   And so I had to start all over with my naming exercise.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.240]   I had to start all over with the creative.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.600]   And again, coming from marketing, colors matter.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.520]   And so I come with all this experience
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.960]   on studies on color association.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   For example, blue is used by Meta, Cisco, AT&T,
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.440]   you name it, because blue from a B2B point of view
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.880]   conveys confidence.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.680]   And so that's why everyone uses freaking blue, right?
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.480]   When you look at blue and you wanna have calls of action,
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.120]   like what's the color wheel?
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.200]   What's the opposite of blue?
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.120]   It's orange and yellow.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.160]   You pair this together, it's really powerful.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.360]   Similar to like purple and yellow.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.440]   So you take like the Los Angeles Lakers,
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.240]   like their logo is iconic, it's distinguishable,
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.240]   and it makes a lot of sense.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.680]   The typeface Lakers is readable over purple, right?
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.800]   So there's all these things that I look into.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   And so I was at the last stretch and I decided
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.480]   I was gonna either pull the plug and then I got saved.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.040]   There's a company agency called John and Jane
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.840]   who had previously worked at a previous company.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.920]   They're like, "Hey, we're seeing what you're trying to do."
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.400]   'Cause I'd kind of narrated my progress.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.080]   And they're like, "Hey, they allocate some pro bono time
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:02.920]   "to do some work."
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.080]   They're like, "Hey, we love your mission,
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.720]   "what you're trying to do."
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.480]   So they came in and they're a branding company.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.840]   And so they came in, we did a whole rebrand study.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.800]   And that turned into what you see now.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.840]   It's the orange and the blue.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.400]   We've done very intentionally.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   We had iterations on like color versus black or gray scale.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.440]   So that turned into a nth hour redesign
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.720]   and rebrand of the whole thing.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.560]   - Wow.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.920]   - And I had to recreate all the assets.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.760]   When you reached out to me and said,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.160]   "Hey, you put those color panels out."
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.760]   I was like, "Oh my God, we literally just redid that."
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.160]   And the fact that it even like kind of registered
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.400]   on your radar has been interesting.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.440]   I was like, "Oh, like this has gotta be real."
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.680]   But yeah, I remember that the last stretch,
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.920]   thinking about the details around like,
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.920]   "How am I gonna content syndicate this thing?
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.120]   "How am I gonna publish it?
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.400]   "What's the cadence?"
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.680]   And I had already locked down and recorded a few episodes.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.640]   I felt pressure to get them out there.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.640]   But man, it was just, it was rough.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.120]   And again, just like launching a product,
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.640]   I was so critical about every single little thing.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.680]   So I was like, "What can I let go and just be at peace
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.840]   "and just let it get into the wild and see what happens?"
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.240]   What's really interesting about both of our journeys
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.640]   is that I had different pain points
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.520]   and I know what I don't know about design
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.200]   and creative and Canva.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.160]   Like with Canva, there's all these templates,
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.880]   but I didn't wanna just like throw something together.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.200]   And I really have to give a shout out,
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.680]   maybe you can put this in the show notes,
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.520]   but it's a blog post article or a framework
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.160]   by a mentor of mine named Paul Millard,
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.000]   and it's called "Ship, Quit and Learn."
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.280]   And so it's saying like,
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.480]   "Hey, if you're gonna start something new,
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.120]   "don't worry about, don't look at Joe Rogan's stuff
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.720]   "and don't look at all these experts
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.400]   "and don't make it perfect, just get it out the door
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.280]   "and commit to a small milestone."
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.200]   For me, it was get to 10 episodes
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.840]   and just get to 10 episodes.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.680]   And then you'll decide, do you like this
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.520]   or do you not like this?
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.320]   Do you wanna keep going or not?
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.240]   And so you're not thinking about the big picture,
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.320]   you're just worried about getting to 10
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.440]   and giving yourself permission to,
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.080]   "Hey, at 10, I'm either gonna quit
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.920]   "or I'm gonna keep going
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.480]   "and I've got what I wanted to done.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.040]   "I'm not a failure, I just, I put it out there."
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.400]   And so his blog and that framework
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.680]   of how he did that was so helpful to me.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.560]   He actually started the podcast about five years ago
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.160]   and he said, "Hey, his episode art
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.120]   "or his cover art for the podcast
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.080]   "took him two minutes and paint,"
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.080]   or one of those simple tools.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.840]   So that gave me the conviction
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.640]   to just get a minimum viable thing done
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.040]   and to put it out there.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.360]   - So now you've got your podcast,
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.800]   you've got guests on here.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.880]   What's next for you?
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.760]   And what are you trying to get out of it?
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.120]   Is there some logic around which customers
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.960]   or which guests you're trying to bring on?
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.680]   Is there a point of view you're trying to convey
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.080]   besides obviously the intent of the podcast?
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.440]   - Yeah, selfishly, I just enjoy having these conversations
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.360]   and meeting interesting people from around the world,
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.760]   from different industries.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.960]   I'm a sales, a B2B sales consultant.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.880]   Now, the folks that I interview on the podcast
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.880]   are mostly sales reps, some sales leaders.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.840]   So I'm not interviewing folks to get customers from it.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.200]   It's not a demand gen or customer acquisition strategy.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.360]   I've seen that with some podcasts
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.760]   and I'm not against that in any way.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.880]   But the podcast is really just about talking to sales reps
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.640]   and sales leaders and hearing the story
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.280]   of their biggest or favorite deal.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.320]   And I just enjoy pattern matching as a consultant.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.120]   I've now talked to 25 really amazing sales folks
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.440]   and heard these stories and am able to kind of see
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.680]   how different industries work.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.000]   I've only worked for a few different companies,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.520]   but now as a consultant, I've delivered about 20 projects
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.760]   and then I've had these 25 conversations
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.120]   and I can kind of see how sales is different
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.360]   in different segments and different markets.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.800]   I will say that the enterprise sales reps
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.960]   who are selling to the biggest companies in the world,
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.880]   there's a reason that they make the most money
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.560]   and they have the best storytelling capabilities
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.960]   and 'cause it is not easy.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.400]   And that's, you can a little bit tell
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.080]   based on how big the deal was, how it all fits.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.560]   - So actually we went this whole time
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.360]   without even naming your podcast.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.640]   We probably, I'll probably edit it back in the beginning.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.560]   - You want to just introduce your podcast, your name
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   and I'm gonna find you.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.640]   - I'm Andrew Cappell.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.360]   I'm the host of "How The Deal Was Done,"
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.960]   Deal Stories podcast.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.240]   We're at 25 episodes and we interview sales reps
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.320]   and sales leaders and learn about their biggest
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.840]   and favorite deals that they've closed in their career.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.240]   - That's awesome.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.400]   So now that you've done this,
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.600]   are you gonna take this knowledge
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.360]   and transfer it to other projects?
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.640]   Are you gonna double down on this?
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.120]   Like what's your plan?
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.640]   - So we're gonna look at the B2B buying journey.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.600]   Tim, you know this well on the marketing side
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.160]   and the reality is that sales reps are not going anywhere,
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.320]   but most of the buying journey happens
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.600]   without the sales rep in the room,
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.040]   which is why the website is so important.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.520]   Digital assets, creative content, podcasts, videos,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   webinars, all this stuff is incorporated
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.760]   'cause it influences the buying committee
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.360]   and the decision makers.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.240]   And so I'm having these interviews
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.280]   with these amazing sales reps and sales leaders.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.040]   We're hearing how the deal was done
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.520]   and the podcast follows the same exact format
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.840]   for every episode.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.040]   Hey, what's your background?
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.440]   Tell us a little bit about yourself.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.600]   How did the deal get started?
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.280]   Why did you choose this deal?
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.720]   What were some of the challenges?
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.480]   And then what were the learnings and outcomes?
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.600]   So it's those same four sections every time.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.040]   And you look at it and you're saying,
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.760]   well, 85% of the buying journey in B2B
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.600]   is spent without the sales rep in the room.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.480]   So yeah, I'm getting the story,
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.840]   but I'm really only getting at most 15% of the story.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.800]   So we've actually done a couple
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.040]   of special edition pilot episodes
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.000]   where we bring in the buyer and the seller
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.280]   and we have a joint episode.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.400]   It's really easy for me as a podcaster
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.680]   because they know each other well,
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.640]   they have a relationship and they're just catching up
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.920]   and they're sharing details
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.760]   that they did not share with each other
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.160]   during the sales cycle.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.880]   So we've done a couple of these
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.640]   with global buyers from IBM, from Uber Eats,
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.720]   and some large million dollar plus deals.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.360]   And that is starting to take off.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.600]   So I'm looking to double down on that
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.240]   and saying, hey, we could actually do something
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.320]   pretty cool here where we bring the buyers
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.720]   and the sellers together.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.040]   And it could be educational for the listeners,
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.240]   for marketing, for a pretty wide audience.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.360]   So that's where I'm looking.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.160]   That's what I'm most excited about right now.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.080]   - That's fascinating.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.320]   I would totally, I mean, I would listen to your episodes,
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.800]   but I would absolutely listen to that
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.560]   'cause there's like, even from a marketing point of view,
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.000]   I'm always trying to figure out like,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.440]   do I understand the buyer
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.080]   and how can I present enough information to them
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.520]   to make your job easier
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.040]   'cause they come in educated as a prospect, right?
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.480]   And so I would love to hear that.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.800]   In these conversations,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.920]   obviously there's sensitivity around
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.480]   divulging too many details, right,
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.960]   that you need to either your company or company name.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.320]   Do you find that being like,
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.680]   do you have to provide guidance and structure
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.960]   on what they can and can't share?
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.920]   Do they self-censor and that kind of
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.520]   leads for weird pockets of conversation
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.360]   'cause they can't talk about stuff?
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.840]   Like, how do you navigate that?
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.440]   - It's a spectrum and it was definitely one of the reasons
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.680]   that I thought the podcast might not work
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.520]   where I was second guessing myself as to,
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.120]   hey, like, is this even gonna be real?
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.320]   Is this gonna be useful?
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:34.240]   Are we gonna have to remove too much sensitive information
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.320]   from who the exact buyer was,
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.400]   what the company was,
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.720]   who they were buying and selling to?
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.240]   But what overcame it is that
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.960]   sales reps are really good storytellers.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   So they can tell good stories and the narrative
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.960]   and they like to talk and share these types of details.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.320]   So most of the time, I'd say it's about 50/50
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.600]   of if they name the exact company and the exact,
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.080]   if they name names per se,
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.240]   or they can generalize it a bit, abstract it a bit.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.400]   And we get, we're not trying to get anyone in trouble.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.680]   We're just trying to have these type of a conversation.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.160]   And if someone said something that they should not have said
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.200]   we can either not publish that podcast or edit it out.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.240]   It really doesn't happen very often.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.200]   And I've had folks from publicly traded companies,
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.480]   international companies, big corporations,
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   and knock on wood, we haven't had any issues with it so far.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.320]   - That's awesome.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.160]   I've had to censor a few of mine and edit some things out
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.360]   'cause there's certain folks in certain roles
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.280]   of the organization
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.920]   where they're closer to legal or PR, for example.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.600]   And so they're a lot more like particular
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.440]   about what they can say.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.480]   And then they'll, in those cases,
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.920]   I just send like a rough cut to them and say,
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.320]   hey, look, let me know if I should remove anything
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.000]   'cause I don't wanna get you in trouble or whatnot.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.800]   Yeah, I'm even thinking for myself, what's next?
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.960]   'Cause I'm looking kinda like you when you said,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.760]   when you jumped into this and not many people are doing it.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.840]   And so either it's the right thing to do
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.000]   or maybe there's a reason why no one's doing that.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.120]   Mine was like the opposite
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.640]   where like there's a lot of content like this,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.480]   but it's usually either like a 10,000 foot view
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.840]   where it's like just big heads talking about big things,
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.640]   or it's like top five things you need to know
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.840]   about answer blank.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.080]   And it's like, maybe it's on or it's off or whatnot.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.160]   What there wasn't was just this genuine,
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.320]   transparent conversation, which I was refreshing.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.240]   So that's why I did this,
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.680]   but I'm looking at other people who do something similar.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.320]   And usually they call to action for this type of a content,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.360]   which is like educational, right?
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.640]   It's like either speak engagement
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.080]   or I'm gonna release some templates
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.480]   that you can sign up for.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.880]   And I like how Zoom just did a little movie there.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.400]   Actually, I don't know if that was a value add feature.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.640]   I digress.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.760]   - It catches attention.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.600]   It catches attention.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.880]   - I mean, too bad for people listening to this
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.720]   on an audio format.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.560]   They won't get that.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.080]   But basically I just did a thumbs up.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.160]   Zoom threw the little emoji up.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.120]   Where it totally backfired was I was in this meeting,
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.960]   Andrew, where someone's relative had passed away.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.800]   - Oh no.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   - And so I was just like, "Oh, that's terrible."
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.640]   You know?
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.800]   And like it threw celebration balloons.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.120]   I was like.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.040]   - I've never done that.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:09.880]   - Oh man.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.840]   I was like, it was so bad.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.080]   I was so embarrassed.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.640]   And I was like, so I turned it off immediately.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.520]   - Sympathy balloons.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.200]   - Sympathy balloons.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:18.880]   And then they had thumbs up.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.720]   And everyone was like, "Oh my gosh, it's terrible."
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.560]   See, where was I?
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.400]   Oh yes.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.520]   So speaking engagements or trying to use it
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.360]   as a demand gen tool, like you mentioned earlier,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.400]   where like you're selling templates and whatever.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.960]   But like for me, I don't know if it's 'cause I'm lazy.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.040]   That's probably a part of it.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.480]   I just don't feel like doing any of that.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.000]   Maybe if my decision was to make this as my primary thing,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.560]   like content creation is life.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.400]   Maybe my approach would be a little different to this.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.600]   'Cause even like I'm looking at you,
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.840]   like the pace that you're creating content, it's fantastic.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.680]   And like, for me, I have a huge backlog of stuff
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.520]   and I'm my own critical path.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.880]   - Yeah.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.240]   - So I think velocity is one thing I'm trying to figure out.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.080]   I'm trying to figure out
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.400]   how to tell different types of stories.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.200]   And so I've always wanted to do on location.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.040]   - Yeah.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.960]   - And so like, I actually wrote the script
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.040]   using chat GPC to help do research on like firefighting.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.600]   Like not everything has to be right.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.040]   And learning the history of firefighting.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.960]   And then with that, I wanna go on location.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.800]   - Wow.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.160]   - And my end goal there is to bring awareness.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.000]   - Yeah.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.840]   - So very different things.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.920]   I think about doing that next,
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.720]   like a lot of on location things.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.560]   - Yeah.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.920]   - Part of this is the entertainment value as well.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.840]   - Yeah.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.680]   - 'Cause for a business audience,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.360]   we can take this only so far.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.560]   It's not gonna get like 5 million views.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.960]   - But it's just a different beast.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.280]   - Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.720]   Would you look for a grant or a sponsor
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.640]   or some group to help facilitate that of like the,
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.560]   there's a group that helps recruit firefighters
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.400]   or something like that,
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.720]   that could help to set that up.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.640]   That could be cool.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.840]   - Yeah, you know, that's actually a good idea.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.240]   Actually, I admire you in how you approached pulling in help
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.560]   whether it's through sponsorships or whatnot.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.320]   I kind of have a little,
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.920]   like still a very self bootstrap mentality,
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.480]   which is probably limiting my ability to scale.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.120]   But like for the firefighter one,
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.520]   like the fire station's like four blocks down.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.600]   So I was literally always my,
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.200]   dude, my game plan was I'm gonna go there
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.880]   with a wireless mic box of donuts
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.720]   and be like, who wants to talk?
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.680]   - Wow, yeah, that'll be great.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.560]   That's the, yeah, just make it happen.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.640]   The tenacity of just figuring it out.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.480]   That's really cool.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.040]   - Yeah, and I get,
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.120]   if I can find a way to turn this project of mine
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.040]   into something that gives back to the community
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.120]   in a real monetary way,
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.120]   whether it's contributing to funds or whatnot.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.280]   Actually, part of the firefighter one
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.360]   was like there's so many people
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.680]   who've been displaced due to California fires
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.400]   and like giving viewers ability
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.920]   to donate to those organizations.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.760]   It's like, that's kind of like a pipe dream of mine.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.360]   Like, I just want to create awareness
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.200]   for that kind of thing.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.160]   So I don't know, maybe that's a phase two of this thing
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.360]   where maybe it goes beyond, let's talk jobs.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.280]   Maybe it's like Silicon Valley life or something else.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.280]   - That is cool.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.600]   You know, you said about the full-time creator.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.880]   I think if you attach your whole identity
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.440]   and your whole career to it,
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.160]   then that opens up a whole nother level of stress
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.960]   and challenges.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.520]   So the fact that you're doing this,
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.160]   I mean, I have a lot of respect for you
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.360]   figuring all this out
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.160]   'cause I've actually built a pretty decent team that helps.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.840]   Brett, who was the editor,
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.560]   now he's the producer of the podcast now that it's 2024.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.200]   So he handles a lot of the logistics,
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.000]   the planning, the pre-production, post-production.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.880]   And I do pretty well with delegating
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.560]   and collaborating with others.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.360]   Now we're working with some different freelancers
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.400]   on the Fiverr application.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.200]   We had a video editor, Bilal, who worked with us in Q4.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.280]   And then the sponsor,
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.640]   they give us the creative inputs as well.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.320]   So it's pretty big production.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.440]   We manage it all in Notion and it's going pretty well.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.200]   - Yeah, I use Notion as well.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.920]   I went through like Monday, Asana, and landing in Notion
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.560]   'cause it's the best free non-paid version
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.480]   of a fully capable tool.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.560]   - Yeah.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.400]   - Yeah, so shout out to Notion.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.240]   Well, hey, Andrew.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.640]   - Not a sponsor, but yeah, they're open.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.040]   - Not yet.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.680]   Notion, if you're listening, I'm a huge fan.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.520]   - Nice.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.680]   - Well, Andrew, hey, just wanna thank you again
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.840]   for being on the show.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.080]   It was really insightful.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.000]   It's really cool hearing how you work through some things.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.200]   If you're open to coming back on the show
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.640]   to talk about other stuff that's on top of mine,
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.160]   I would love to have you back.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.200]   - I'm happy to, yeah.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.920]   I've done the recent transition from a sales rep
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.880]   to a consultant and trying to make that, to bridge that.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.880]   So happy to talk about that in the future.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.200]   - So how can people find you?
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.800]   - LinkedIn, that is the main channel that I use.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.000]   I see, Tim, that you're on YouTube.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.640]   I didn't put my content up on YouTube.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.480]   I was a little bit worried
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.240]   that the view count would be so low,
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.080]   but we actually did just open up our YouTube channel.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.440]   Brett Muni, who's our producer, is running that.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.240]   How the deal was done, Deal Stories podcast.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.440]   So you can find it on YouTube, Spotify, Apple, anywhere else.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.240]   And then I'm pretty active on LinkedIn.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.760]   So if anyone has any questions,
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.660]   I'd love to be a resource and help.
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.500]   - Awesome.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.800]   And all that information would be down
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.440]   in the description of the video as well.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.160]   Andrew, thanks for spending your time with us today.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.000]   - Thanks, Tim.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.840]   It's been great.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.480]   you
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
