[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.900]   - The Desiring God National Conference begins on Friday.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.700]   It's a conference dedicated to C.S. Lewis,
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.180]   and we're titling the conference,
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.220]   The Romantic Rationalist, God, Life, and Imagination
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.060]   in the Work of C.S. Lewis.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.180]   The fun starts on Friday
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.220]   at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.460]   Pastor John, what do you look forward to from the speakers,
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.140]   and maybe give us a sense of what you'll be sharing
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.620]   at the conference yourself?
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.140]   - Tony, the more I read and think
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.380]   in preparation for this conference on C.S. Lewis,
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.140]   the more excited I get.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.540]   And I know that Lewis had his flaws.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.420]   The more I read, the more I know.
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.940]   Personal flaws, moral flaws, relational flaws,
[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.340]   doctrinal flaws, we won't celebrate those,
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.420]   and we won't ignore those.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.060]   But here's why we turn to him, frankly,
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.740]   with deep-felt thankfulness,
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.740]   and a desire to honor him 50 years after his death.
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.660]   Let me put it in a quote from Peter Crift
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.740]   in an essay that he wrote 30-some years ago.
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.340]   I just love this quote,
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.260]   and it'll give the people a sense of what we're in for.
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.460]   "Once upon a dreary era,
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.520]   "when the world of specialization
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.560]   "had nearly made obsolete all universal geniuses,
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.680]   "romantic poets, Platonic idealists,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.180]   "rhetorical craftsmen, even Orthodox Christians,
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.180]   "there appeared a man, almost as if from another world,
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.420]   "one of the worlds of his own fiction.
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.260]   "Was he a man, or something more like elf or angel,
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.600]   "who was all these things as an amateur,
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.540]   "as well as probably the world's foremost authority
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.940]   "in his professional province
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.180]   "of medieval and Renaissance English literature?
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.100]   "Before his death in 1963,
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.680]   "he found time to produce first-quality works
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.980]   "of literary history, literary criticism,
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.660]   "theology, philosophy, autobiography,
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.640]   "biblical studies, historical philology,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.640]   "fantasy, science fiction, letters, poems, sermons,
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.000]   "formal and informal essays, a historical novel,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.100]   "a spiritual diary, religious allegory,
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.200]   "short stories, and children's novels.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.700]   "Clive Staples Lewis was not a man.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.140]   "He was a world," end quote.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.460]   That's remarkable.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.300]   And you read that kind of accolade
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.760]   over and over again for the last 50 years.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.140]   What kind of man was this?
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.260]   What was it that caused people
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.340]   to write things like that about him?
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.720]   Well, I'm really excited that Philip Reichan,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.460]   president of Wheaton, is gonna come
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.220]   and tackle the issue of Lewis's view of scripture
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.640]   and errancy, and Lewis, as the patron saint
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.960]   of evangelicalism, I'm excited that Doug Wilson
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.180]   is gonna tackle the issue of what did he really believe
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.140]   about salvation?
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.140]   Was he a reformed person in his soteriology
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.980]   or wasn't he?
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.380]   Kevin Van Hooser from Trinity's gonna talk
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.380]   about the role of imagination in theology and discipleship.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.420]   And Randy Alcorn's gonna tackle heaven
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.740]   and the new earth with Lewis as his help.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.420]   And then we don't even have a second string in this.
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.860]   The seminars that you saw, well, here's the second,
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.900]   they're not second string.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.540]   Indy Wilson with the Myth Wars, C.S. Lewis and Scientism,
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.460]   and Colin Duryez, the friendship of Lewis with Tolkien
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.860]   and the Lord of the Rings, and Lyle Dorsett,
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.260]   who's written and lectured extensively on Lewis
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.540]   in his Care of Souls, and Joe Rigney,
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.060]   who's read as much and thought as much about this
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.060]   as any young person I know on Live Like a Narnian.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.580]   So the lineup here is simply stunning.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.300]   It's one of the conferences that I expect
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.220]   to learn heaps from.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.420]   And as far as my own messages go,
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.140]   I've been working really hard on these in the last weeks,
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.340]   and I am so amazed at what I'm seeing.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.820]   My first job on the first night is to say,
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.420]   why did we title this thing Romantic Rationalist?
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.780]   And the deeper I've gone into,
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.060]   what do we mean by romantic?
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.220]   What do we mean by rationalist?
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.140]   And how did that work itself out in bringing him to Christ
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.820]   and in the way he did all of his ministry
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.420]   of teaching and writing, speaking,
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.820]   in the use of metaphor and poetry and story?
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.620]   I think it's getting more profound the more I look at it.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.500]   And then the last thing I'll do on Sunday morning
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.060]   in the setting of our worship service
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.060]   is to do an exposition of 1 Timothy 4, 1 to 5,
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.460]   which has this phrase in it,
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.700]   "Everything created by God is good,
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.580]   and nothing is to be rejected
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.740]   if it is received with thanksgiving,
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.740]   for it is made holy by the word of God in prayer."
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.020]   And with Lewis's help, I wanna try to unpack
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.020]   how is creation, sex and food, particularly in this text,
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.140]   made holy by the word of God in prayer?
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.540]   So yeah, I'm really excited.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.860]   If people haven't signed up to come, I hope they will.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.820]   - Yes, me too.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.100]   And there's still time to register for the conference,
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.500]   which you can do through the desiringgod.org website
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.140]   until September 25th.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.260]   You can register on-site at the conference
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.980]   at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.420]   And if you can't make it to Minneapolis this weekend,
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.940]   the conference will be live-streamed
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.620]   at desiringgod.org/live.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.720]   Of course, all the messages will be archived on the website
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.100]   for future viewing and listening as well.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.900]   I hope to see you in Minneapolis.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:16.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
