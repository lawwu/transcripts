[00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.680]   - Well, welcome gentlemen.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.680]   We've had two days of tremendous preaching,
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.760]   tremendous singing.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.760]   It is a joy to hear men sing who love Christ.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.720]   - Amen.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.840]   - And to be able to be with them.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.680]   Now we've heard some great preaching
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.940]   on the topic of truth triumphs.
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.640]   Now we're gonna come down to implementing it.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.960]   Truth triumphs, how do we live it out?
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.160]   Come on up Bill.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.360]   How do we live it out down in the trenches?
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.000]   When you're hand-to-hand combat,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.180]   when you're fighting spiritual forces of darkness?
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.360]   How are we going to work through that?
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.140]   So we're going to have a discussion.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.520]   My name is George Crawford.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.080]   I've had the privilege of serving as an elder here
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.400]   since 1996.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.720]   We have a saying here that some of our elders
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.080]   are good for something and some of them
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.180]   are good for nothing.
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.040]   The former being guys who are on staff,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.600]   the latter being guys who,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.560]   using a very non-biblical term, are lay elders.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.300]   I am one of the latter.
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.000]   With me, and I'm gonna ask the gentleman to give,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.820]   in the interest of brevity,
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.000]   in the interest of a military carryover,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.680]   name, rank, and serial number, starting with Mr. Hargrove.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.480]   Carl Hargrove, one of the elders here,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.640]   pastoral staff overseeing Grace Advance,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.560]   and also faculty at the Master's Seminary.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.800]   And what areas of ministry do you do here at Grace?
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.200]   Grace Advance is a ministry where we help churches
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.080]   in North America plant churches and revitalize.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.800]   And also with Bill Shannon,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.960]   pastor fellowship group here called Anchor.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.520]   Some history with Grace Church, just briefly.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   I was sent out by Grace Church in 1993
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.120]   to plant a church, and did that for 20 years,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.620]   and 10 years ago asked to come back.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.560]   So I've been back here for 10 years now.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.000]   I've been 20 years of ministry.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.040]   - Tom?
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.160]   - Tom Patton, I'm a pastor here at Grace Church.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.360]   I'm an elder as well.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.520]   I also have a fellowship group that I pastor
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.200]   along with John Street, who's right over there
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.600]   talking as I'm talking, which is interesting.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.200]   (laughing)
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.160]   He knows me, so he doesn't care.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.620]   And been here for about 30 years.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.040]   Since 1991 is when I came here, been on staff since 2001.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.320]   And also teach at the seminary, I teach preaching there.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.360]   And I'm a part of Grace Advance, of Carl's ministry as well.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.840]   And we all kind of do a lot of things around here.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.220]   We all wear a lot of different hats.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.060]   But that's what I do.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.480]   - We wear a multiplicity of hats.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.320]   - We do.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   - One of the hats that Tom wears is that of Ranger Joe.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.900]   - Yes, I should have brought my hat, sorry.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.920]   - So if you want to catch--
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.760]   - Truly another hat.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.720]   - Truly another hat.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.580]   - Ranger Joe episodes, you can find them on Grace Media.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.140]   - Yes, Grace Media app.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.020]   - I've been telling him, Mr. Rogers, move over.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.640]   (laughing)
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.160]   Tom is also the voice of Grace Church.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.700]   Most of the time he is the emcee,
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.900]   if you would want to call it as such,
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.300]   for our morning worship service
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.740]   and even the evening worship service.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.580]   And we're grateful for it.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.020]   - It's a privilege.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.420]   - Bill, have a seat.
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.420]   - First of all, I need to seek forgiveness.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.720]   I got up here late, but I can't get through that courtyard
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.260]   without seeing an old friend.
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.540]   (laughing)
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.380]   And they're all old, I don't know why.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.180]   (laughing)
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.800]   I've been here for 42 years at Grace Community Church.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.940]   I've been on staff for 34 years now.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.100]   And I oversee the counseling department
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.240]   here at Grace Church.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.860]   We teach counseling.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.940]   We try to train folks that can help with counseling,
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.460]   whether it be prayer room counseling
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.300]   or it be individuals in Bible study, whatever it is.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.540]   That's what we do.
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.860]   As Carl has already told you,
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.020]   we co-pastor Anchored Fellowship Group.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.820]   We take our own, somebody always asks me,
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.700]   "So, do you follow each other in the Bible?"
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.440]   No, we do our own thing.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.700]   Because Carl doesn't let me tell him what to do.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.540]   - Yeah.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.180]   (laughing)
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.220]   He's tried.
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.980]   (laughing)
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.940]   All right.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.780]   - That's my history.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.420]   I have two girls.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.540]   Both of those girls are married to fine men.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.700]   One of them, my son-in-law's down in the main sanctuary,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.580]   my competition right now, speaking there.
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.660]   And the other one is in Arizona,
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.180]   and he's the elder of his church that he goes to.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.020]   - Yes.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.380]   You can always tell a lot about a man
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.020]   by looking at what his adult children are doing.
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.020]   And there's been a history of faithfulness here.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.660]   I work in the area.
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.000]   My secular world employment was as a prosecuting attorney.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.260]   And as an administrative law judge,
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.660]   I taught part-time at Masters University
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.380]   for something like 30 years.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.860]   Since I was able to walk away,
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.180]   I have been redeployed into ministry here.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.780]   I serve on our Grace Advance team.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.780]   That is one of the most important ministries we have here,
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.780]   and probably one of the least known ministries internally,
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.700]   and outside, most appreciated.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.080]   I also serve on our missions board,
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.820]   Grace Missions International.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.620]   We do everything we can to try to proclaim
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.260]   the word of God throughout the nations.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.180]   Book of Malachi, my name will be great among the nations.
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.020]   So we passionately committed to that.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.380]   Now, what are we wanting to accomplish today?
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.860]   Again, as I indicated earlier,
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.060]   we've heard some great preaching.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.140]   Now we need to think through how it is
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.820]   that we can encourage ourselves in the process
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.460]   by wrestling with some challenging questions
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.240]   in 1 Timothy 3.15, Paul writes, he says,
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.820]   "I write so that you will know
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.880]   "how one ought to conduct himself
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.160]   "in the household of God,
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.660]   "which is the church of the living God,
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.860]   "the pillar and support, the buttress,
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.560]   "the bulwark of the truth."
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.300]   We are going to try to start off
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.580]   with some questions that we'll ask internally.
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.820]   Wanna get you to start thinking.
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.620]   I'm gonna have three somewhat abstract questions,
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.140]   and I'll move to three very practical questions
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.540]   that if you've been in ministry for any length of time,
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.220]   you've probably, to one extent or another,
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.740]   addressed these or thought about them.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.600]   My son, Steve, who's in pastoral ministry in Kansas,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.700]   was cautioning me that we need
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.420]   to include something like this.
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.100]   Then we're going to turn the mic over
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.820]   to questions from the floor.
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.820]   Make sure, and I've already asked the guys to screen them,
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.820]   make sure that if I ask you,
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.100]   "Is there really a question here?"
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.340]   you can answer yes.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.300]   We all know of guys that come to the mic under Q&A,
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.180]   and they want to pose a statement.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.980]   So make sure it's really a question.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.480]   And we'll try to ask them, we'll try to get them.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.920]   We want you to feel the freedom,
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.480]   to the extent you can,
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.820]   the freedom to be able to speak questions
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.080]   that are from the heart, that are really on your mind.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.680]   We have an hour.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.880]   We are more than willing to talk
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.080]   after the expiration of that hour,
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.280]   fully expecting, fully realizing
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.480]   that that may need to be done.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.000]   So let's start with a word of prayer,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.200]   and then we'll get going.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.240]   Father in heaven, I want to thank you
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.240]   for each of these men, many of them I've not seen in years.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.640]   Thank you for their commitment to Christ.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.600]   Thank you for the love for your church
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.340]   that has brought them to this particular point.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.080]   Father, we pray that men will be encouraged,
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.560]   they will be strengthened,
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.540]   they will be injected with iron,
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.020]   and a determination to continue serving
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.360]   as the foundation and bulwark of your truth.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.660]   Guide us, Lord, in all we do today.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.700]   We trust you, amen.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.580]   Now, in keeping with the theme of the conference,
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.500]   as you think through the question, frame it.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.220]   Keep in mind that it needs to be approaching the idea
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.620]   centered around the truth.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.600]   So I'm gonna start this off with number one.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.040]   (laughing)
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.120]   Technology.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:11.880]   Over the last five to 10 years in our culture,
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.880]   in the church at large, and at Grace Community Church,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.320]   where and how have you seen departures from
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.080]   or disobedience to the truth?
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.400]   - Oh my, five to 10 years?
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.240]   - Five to 10 years?
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.240]   - Of disobedience to the truth?
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.680]   And we have an hour.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.760]   (laughing)
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.120]   Yeah, well, I think you go back to just that the truth.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.880]   So all of the departures are gonna find their origin
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.680]   in a denial that there is an absolute truth.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.320]   So I just think it's been manifest in different ways,
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.460]   whether it be manifest in how we understand gender,
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.360]   whether it's been manifest in how we understand
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.200]   a woman's role, a man's role,
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.400]   whether it's manifest in how we preach,
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.720]   whether it's manifest in what we believe about Christ.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.800]   All of those things have an origin,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.160]   and the origin is based in a denial of an absolute truth.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.720]   You know, it's the question that Pilate asked,
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.600]   what is truth?
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.400]   Well, we have the definition for that,
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   because the church, according to Paul's words to Timothy,
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.140]   the church is the pillar and support of a truth.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.700]   Did it say that?
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.220]   No, the truth that we proclaim the gospel
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.980]   and all of its implications that come with it.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.980]   So it's just the manifestations of disobedience are varying.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.860]   - Okay.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.580]   - Everything, like I said, from how do we understand a man
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.380]   to same sex attraction to the list goes on and on and on.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.900]   But the basis of it is a denial of truth.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.840]   - Yeah, I mean-- - And if you're not sure
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.040]   what truth is, Mark Zakevich is doing a seminar right now
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.320]   on the topic, if you wanna transfer.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.960]   - You can leave now, that's fine.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.240]   - Tom, you were gonna say something.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.360]   - No, I was just gonna piggyback off of what Carl said.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.600]   I think, you know, when you think of the culture,
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.280]   the departure from the truth is probably most manifested
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.840]   in the fact that they no longer really hold to a truth.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.120]   They no longer really hold to some of the things
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.600]   we're used to.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.100]   I'd say, generally speaking, it's more permissiveness
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.000]   in sin, that would be the general topic.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.040]   Being more permissive, less guilt,
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.640]   even on a very superficial level,
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.720]   to feel any kind of restraint upon them.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.880]   It says in the scripture that the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.960]   in the days of the ban of lawlessness,
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.000]   will release his restraint.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.440]   And so it seems as if that restraint is becoming less
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.980]   and less as time goes on.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.460]   So without the particulars of how that looks in the world,
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.780]   I think my mind goes to how it looks like in the church,
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.340]   what it's been the big effect over the last 10 years.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:12:00.340]   I remember when my dad was in the church as a young man,
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.200]   there was always a sense that maybe the church
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.360]   was more biblical back in the day,
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.440]   we're talking about in the '50s and '60s.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.920]   But I've learned as time goes on,
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.320]   that's not necessarily the case, it was more masked.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.840]   More and more, the church was kind of just being moral
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.720]   and trying to not really speak about things
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.920]   that were urgent, for instance.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.960]   Church discipline, we think, or I used to think,
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.040]   was something that was a part of church history
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.760]   when my dad was growing up.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.920]   I asked John MacArthur one time about that.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.480]   He said, you know what, I don't remember church discipline
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.120]   even being in my father's church
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.840]   or the churches at his time.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.520]   So this is something that, in some ways,
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.280]   we've come more advanced in some of our reformed circles
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.360]   to be taking the Bible more seriously.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.720]   But you see more permissiveness in the culture,
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.160]   and I think you see, at least in our circles,
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.840]   more seriousness about the doctrines of grace
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.880]   and the truth of the scripture.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.100]   So that's happening, but I know it seems,
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.360]   to some people who are looking at it
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.280]   maybe a little superficially, like this is an avalanche,
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.000]   and where is this all coming from?
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.880]   But it seems like the storm has been building
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.280]   for a very long time.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.600]   So I think Martin Lloyd-Jones is the one that said,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.760]   you know, I'm really never surprised
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.560]   because the Bible tells us that these things will happen.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.440]   I'm not sitting in shock thinking, how can this be?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   But I think our people are in shock,
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.440]   and our people have to be fortified.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.880]   And so one of the greatest things
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.520]   I think we can teach our people
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.480]   is this is not a surprise to God,
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.600]   and we can prove that by going to the scripture
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.520]   and showing that these things have been predicted
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.580]   from Jesus' day and before,
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.640]   and I think that's a helpful way to look at it.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.800]   >> So we, to some degree, react to that
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.120]   by helping our people get past the shock,
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.280]   by helping them to realize that this is nothing
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.120]   that has taken God by surprise.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.520]   >> Right, and I think they find comfort in their pastor
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.440]   having that kind of poise about the truth
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.500]   so that they're not seeing you shaken
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.760]   by the things in the world
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.640]   because you're rooted in the scripture
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.600]   and you know what our Lord has said
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.420]   and what the book of Revelation has said
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.840]   and the book of Daniel that we found out from Abner.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.720]   These things are to make us shock-proof, if you will.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   We might be surprised, but we're not shocked.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.360]   >> And to some degree, we help people
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.120]   by helping the weak, strengthening the weak,
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.200]   dealing with situations where people have been scarred.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.700]   Bill, you wanna talk to that?
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.520]   By the loss of--
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.720]   >> This idea of what's coming into the church,
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.760]   I think is what's been in the culture for a while,
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.240]   is the cancel culture is starting to come into the church.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.000]   Some of you men start to feel that pressure from people.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.360]   That are not liking what you're doing
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.120]   or how the church is doing it and those kinds of things.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.800]   And they bring those questions in all the time.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.400]   Which has absolutely nothing to do with the truth,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.340]   but they're hammering away at you ever so slowly,
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.480]   and I think that's part of what Satan's plan is,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.680]   and he's using the people of God, even,
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.500]   to do those kinds of things.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.140]   How do we help them, though?
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.120]   How do we help our brothers and sisters?
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.600]   And the only way to do that is through the truth.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.160]   I think of 1 Timothy 1.5, the goal of our instruction
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.960]   is love from a pure heart, a sincere faith.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.840]   That's the goal of our instruction.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.440]   We need to keep teaching them, and teaching them,
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.920]   and teaching them, even when they don't listen.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.160]   I can remember, not too long ago,
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.240]   receiving an email from a husband and wife,
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.480]   and the husband and wife wrote,
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.000]   "We are not listening to you in the counseling room."
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.200]   You're not the only one, is what I answered.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.080]   But that's what happens.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.960]   - If Bill wanted to hear that,
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.520]   he could talk to his wife, Donna.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.740]   - Well, I do listen to her.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.240]   But, I mean, that's part of what the people wanna do.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.240]   They wanna throw back at you
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.000]   that you're not what you are saying you are.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.820]   - Okay, great.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.200]   Now, it's interesting that you mentioned Satan.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.880]   In my own personal study, I've been reading
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.480]   Luther's commentary on the book of Galatians.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.120]   Galatians 3.1, and this is from the NKJV.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.880]   "O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.520]   "that you should not obey the truth,"
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.440]   and that's added in the King James and the New King James.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.120]   You won't find it in the NASV or the ESV.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.280]   "Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.540]   "before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.560]   "was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?"
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.560]   Any thoughts as to the extent to which this departure,
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.280]   this rejection of the truth, is due to the evil one,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.400]   and how do we react to that?
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.240]   Thoughts on that.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:54.480]   - Well, we know that society is under the god of this world.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.360]   That's clear.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.760]   That's why when a person comes to face 2 Corinthians 4,
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.080]   this veil is removed, but prior to it,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.520]   they were blinded, their minds were blinded.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.640]   So you say, well, their mind was blinded,
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.600]   because that's Ephesians chapter four,
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.280]   because they walked in the futility of their mind.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.880]   They were darkened in their understanding.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.160]   So we can see that there is an influence that is there.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.180]   It's a spiritual influence.
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.560]   So if he's the god of this world,
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.000]   you're going to orchestrate the world
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.040]   in accord to your ultimate goal.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.240]   The ultimate goal would be to thwart the plans of God,
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.040]   but we all know, praise God, that that cannot happen, right?
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.120]   Brothers?
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.960]   That can't happen.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.800]   We know how it ends.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.640]   Our God is victorious.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.400]   But he is doing everything he can
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.900]   to disrupt God glorifying himself,
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.980]   which means operating through principalities
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.480]   and powers and higher entities in society,
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:58.440]   in politics, in culture, in religion itself,
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.880]   because every other religion,
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.360]   its backdrop is going to be the enemy,
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.020]   because he's the enemy of the souls of men.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.680]   So that's where we come back to.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.240]   Ultimately, the devil is, the scripture is clear,
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.720]   he is a liar, and he has been a liar from the beginning.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.680]   - What passage is that from, Carl?
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.640]   - So John.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.040]   - 844.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.440]   Make sure, two things.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.040]   He is a murderer, and he is a liar.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   And when he speaks, he speaks lies.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.320]   It is his native language.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.160]   Go ahead.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.920]   - Which is the opposite of what we're talking about.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.080]   Lies don't triumph, truth triumphs.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.680]   So he will not triumph.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.000]   The truth will be triumphant.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.880]   So Christ told us that's his very nature to do that.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.680]   So in society, we can say that the lies
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.560]   are propagated by the hand of the enemy.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.560]   So we do battle.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.640]   And this is why Ephesians chapter six tells us what?
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.240]   That we're not fighting against flesh and blood.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.840]   This is why Paul said, even what we heard
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.120]   in the first message from 2 Corinthians,
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.120]   that these spiritual fortresses, we bring down.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.200]   We bring them down with different weapons.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.760]   And that weapon is the truth of God's word
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.600]   and his preaching.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.920]   - Ultimately, the key approach is bringing truth to bear.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.320]   - Tom, you had something in mind.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   You're looking for a passage.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.160]   I can read that in your face.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.320]   - No, I just noticed you were quizzing us,
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.520]   so I thought I might be prepared.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.680]   - Good man.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.240]   - I'm reading that back, I didn't know.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.040]   - You kind of already went through ordination, George.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.080]   - Always be ready to speak and give a defense
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.400]   of the hope that is in you, George.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.880]   - Especially with George.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.720]   - Go ahead, Tom.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.280]   - No, I was just gonna say, in our particular context,
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.640]   because of the fact we are just down the street
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.760]   from one of the largest charismatic churches in California,
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.960]   we have dealt over the years with the fact
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.880]   that people have come and done a lot of confessing blame
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.400]   on Satan for their sin.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.540]   And so instead of going to the book of James
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.400]   and speaking about, well, isn't that from the temptations
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.160]   which wage war in you, and isn't that also your own sin
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.240]   giving birth to that?
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.880]   And so we've had to kind of walk people back
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.120]   from emphasis on, as Sanford and Sons used to say,
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.780]   the devil made me do it, if you remember that.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.620]   Some of you are not old enough to know that.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.960]   - That was Flip Wilson, Tom.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.480]   - Flip Wilson, excuse me.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.200]   I defer, so I can't get the scripture right
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.840]   or the television program right.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.000]   But do you know the idea there is,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.960]   that's a real thing that sometimes our church, I believe,
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.440]   can almost discount because we're trying to overcorrect
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.120]   from people who think that there's so much influence
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.960]   by Satan that the devil made me do it.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.660]   So it's a balance that we walk.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.360]   Years ago, people would come here
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.660]   and have just been so obsessed with the idea
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.920]   that Satan is guiding their every thought,
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.280]   even though they're believers.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.960]   And we're saying that can't be true.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.920]   You can be influenced, you can be harassed.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.160]   Satan is powerful.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.520]   You go to the book of Job chapter one,
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.480]   and you see with God's permission,
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.800]   he can do whatever God allows him to do.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.160]   As Luther said, the devil is God's devil.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.080]   And so that is something that we have
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.280]   to keep in balance here.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.960]   So instead of overcompensating and trying to say,
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.320]   no, it's all just your sin,
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.040]   we have to have an appreciation for the fact,
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.920]   no, Satan is real, is the tempter.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.640]   Even in the Lord's Prayer, many translations will say,
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.800]   keep us from temptation and deliver us from evil
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.400]   or from the evil one.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.240]   - The evil one.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.400]   - So you have to be mindful that there is a balance in that,
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.280]   and you're always kind of never wanting to discount
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.120]   the power of that creature, as was described earlier today,
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.600]   but also on the other side,
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.680]   not to de-emphasize someone's own sin
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.760]   for leading them into temptation.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.120]   - Excellent, excellent.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.200]   Bill, you wanna add anything?
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.560]   - Yes, I do.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.880]   I'm thinking, I'm looking out here,
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.440]   and I see either men that are elders,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.920]   men that are about to be elders,
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.260]   maybe men that are thinking they'd like to be elders.
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.760]   How do we protect the church?
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.200]   We have to know the truth ourselves
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.260]   in order to protect the church,
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.920]   'cause you have people that come,
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.680]   that wanna become members even,
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.440]   and I've seen that at Grace Church,
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.880]   wanna become members and they can't give a testimony
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.940]   or they don't know the answer to some simple questions.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.960]   That's how we protect the church.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.000]   When we just give 'em a rubber stamp and let 'em in,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.080]   all you're doing is letting in trouble.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.440]   So you have to protect that church as much as possible,
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.540]   and that is not only just the preaching,
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.460]   but then when you're visiting with them,
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.640]   even one-on-one, wait a minute, that's not true.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.700]   I had somebody give me a testimony once.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.780]   He says, "Yes, when I was three or four,
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.400]   "I went to sleep and I believed I was in heaven.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.940]   "I saw Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, and I became a Christian."
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.500]   I knew right away he didn't become a Christian,
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.260]   'cause he did not know what it meant
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.020]   to be a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.220]   So make sure of protecting the church first, right up front.
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.340]   - Acts 20, Paul writes to the Ephesian elders,
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.700]   "Keep watch over yourself, keep watch over the church."
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.540]   One of the most thought-provoking passages
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.860]   in all of the New Testament, he says,
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.500]   "From among yourselves there will arise men,"
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.420]   and these were men who he had discipled,
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.380]   these were men whom he had served with,
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.500]   prayed with, cried with.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.520]   He says, "From among yourselves there will be men
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.960]   "who arise to pervert the truth,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.160]   "to draw people away after themselves."
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.500]   We have to be vigilant against even that.
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.780]   Fantastic to point that out, Bill.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:59.800]   If you want any more thought on this information,
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.520]   I would recommend, first of all, John's sermon,
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   November of 2017, on this particular text, Galatians 3.1.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.640]   Also, Luther on Galatians 3.1.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.200]   We don't wanna make too much of it,
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.420]   but we do not want to ignore the reality of it.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.560]   Now, we're living in a world, as a culture,
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.560]   we've talked about this already, Romans 1.25.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:32.100]   We're looking at a world that has perverted good and evil.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.180]   Isaiah 5.20, Malachi 2.17, people are saying,
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.740]   "Where is the God of justice?
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.720]   "Why isn't he doing anything about this?"
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.040]   They're calling that which the scripture says evil,
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.260]   they're calling it good, and they're doing the converse.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.740]   How do we cope and respond to that within the church?
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.880]   I'll start with Bill,
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.920]   and then we'll work our way back to Carl.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.840]   - Again, you still have to come back to teaching the truth.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.960]   If you're just having coffee
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.000]   and just having those kinds of times,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.400]   I think you need to be upfront with your people
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.840]   and teaching them all the time.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.880]   That is what's, I think, most vital,
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.240]   is somebody came here and visited Grace Church.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.080]   They took a walk around.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.880]   They spent two weeks here.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.460]   The guy came to me afterwards, and he says,
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.380]   "All you guys do here is teach God's word."
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.040]   - And we say, "You have a problem with that?"
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.020]   - I looked at him, and I said,
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.240]   "Is there something else to teach?"
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.680]   Because, I mean, what do we have?
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.480]   The only thing that makes it valid right here
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.200]   is God's truth, and he's given it to us,
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.800]   and we need to continue to teach that.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.800]   - And that, by the way, is the basis of all of our counsel.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.920]   There is, at times, very subtle ways
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.480]   of trying to inject something else
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.440]   into being the basis of our counseling.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.280]   No, we are from the scripture.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.800]   We will not speak beyond what God has called us to say.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.240]   Tom.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.400]   - Well, just listening to what you were saying,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.480]   the world does say what is evil is good,
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.520]   and we say that no, that's defined by scripture.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.520]   So it does go back even to what Bill's talking about,
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.320]   which is to be known by being a man of the word.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.880]   And what I've noticed is that it's very, very easy
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.920]   just to get into kind of practical,
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.320]   one-on-one discussion with your flock,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.480]   social things, issues in life,
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.300]   and to try to kind of relate to them,
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.520]   and to stray away from just going to the Bible,
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.840]   because people might think, well, they know this,
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.720]   they've heard this, this is not something that,
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.540]   I just don't want to be a person
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.580]   that's like a Bible thumper, if you will.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.600]   But in my experience, when you don't do that,
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.880]   at least at our church, and again,
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.480]   I haven't been anywhere in years and years,
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.440]   he's thumping the Bible,
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.520]   is that when we don't do that,
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.560]   people will literally criticize,
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.680]   and will sit there and say, you know what,
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.080]   so-and-so, I went to see him,
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.560]   and he didn't open up in prayer,
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.560]   he didn't direct me to passages
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.720]   with addresses assigned to them,
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.280]   all we did was talk about my issues,
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.700]   and I'm thinking, that happened here?
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.800]   That happened at Grace Church?
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.480]   So, don't be afraid to just open the Bible,
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.580]   in fact, in my office, if you come in,
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.480]   I just have a Bible that's already open
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.440]   on the other side of the table,
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.280]   and it's there so people don't even have an excuse,
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.660]   because if they don't bring their Bible,
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.200]   there's one right there, it's open,
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.960]   and then I have them read out the passage
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.320]   that I'm directing them to,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.400]   because sometimes it's even more effective for me
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.560]   to have them hear their own voice speak God's word,
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.080]   than even me to speak it to them,
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.340]   so they have to actually take the time to do it,
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.120]   it's a simple little technique someone told me years ago,
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.240]   but again, it goes back to the question,
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.880]   how do you discern between what is good and what is evil?
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.480]   Well, there's only one way to discern it,
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.840]   and that is through God's word,
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.520]   and we believe that, but sometimes through time urgency,
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.440]   or just, I don't know, the desire to be,
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.040]   maybe if you have a small church,
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.640]   the desire to be more kind of a friendly,
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.240]   user-friendly kind of church,
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.280]   where you're not trying to quote-unquote judge them,
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.040]   that you might talk politics, you might talk philosophy,
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.420]   or whatever you might do,
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.640]   and you know it's not what they need,
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.520]   but you're trying to be relatable,
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.960]   I would just really say that the most relatable thing
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.260]   in the world is just cutting it straight,
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.760]   and cutting it straight with the Bible
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.640]   is the only option that we have.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.320]   - Great, and Tom, Carl?
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.880]   - Carl, yeah, let's just kind of be direct here,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.700]   it's the word of God, we all agree with that,
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.520]   that's why you came here with 5,000 other men
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.480]   to this conference,
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.640]   because you knew you would hear the word of God,
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.080]   so look at 1 Timothy with me,
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.720]   you would notice if you were to go through Timothy,
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.760]   I think it was like 13 places
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.720]   where you're going to see the doctrine
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.960]   either said specifically or by clear inference.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:11.440]   Verse three, not to teach strange doctrines,
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.260]   so you're instructing, which means you're teaching.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.920]   Verse five, the goal of our instruction,
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.000]   love, pure heart, good conscience, sincere faith.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.600]   Notice verse 15, it's a trustworthy statement,
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.920]   deserving full, notice, full acceptance,
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.400]   full acceptance.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:36.400]   Verse 17, this lofty theology of God,
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.920]   king, eternal, immortal, invisible, only God,
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.640]   glory and honor forever and ever.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.440]   Look at chapter two, there in verse five,
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.040]   there's one mediator, God and man,
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.660]   this is teaching doctrine.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.400]   Verse 13 and 14, Adam was first created,
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.100]   then Eve, the woman was deceived.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.200]   Look at chapter three, verse one,
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.440]   it's a trustworthy statement, he says.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.440]   Chapter 315, how you should conduct yourselves.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.480]   Now, this is your behavior in the household of God,
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.300]   which is that pillar in support of the truth.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.880]   Chapter four, verse one, let me tell you,
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.720]   the latter times, we've already talked about that.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.800]   Expect it, this is what Tom was saying,
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.280]   expect it, the doctrines of demons.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.280]   Again, there is doctrinal misappropriation error
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.640]   in the church, who's behind it?
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.880]   Well, the scripture just says demons are.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.160]   So verse six, the words of the faith
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.400]   and the sound doctrine which you've been following.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.800]   Verse nine, trustworthy statement.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   Verse 11, prescribe and teach these things.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.160]   Verse 16, pay close attention to yourself
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   and to your teaching, he says, and then it ends,
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.180]   I think the last one is chapter six, verse two.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:06.180]   Teach and prescribe and preach these principles.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.360]   Pretty convincing, at least for me it is.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.160]   - All scripture is inspired by God.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.700]   We read that in 2 Timothy 3.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.480]   And yet, there is a sense in which those of us
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.000]   who are in leadership find ourselves again and again
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and again in the pastoral epistles.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   In fact, I came across a quote in none other than Augustine,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.320]   which says if you have any position of leadership,
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.640]   the pastoral epistles need to be continually
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.600]   before your mind.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.080]   So I appreciate you mentioning 1 Timothy,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.520]   2 Timothy, and Titus.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.780]   Don't let them get out of your thinking, ever.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.800]   We're gonna have three questions,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.560]   and then we're gonna try to, what's that?
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.400]   - The timing.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.680]   - Yeah, three questions.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.560]   - Time's running out.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:58.560]   - Number one, pastor, my wife has just been diagnosed
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.360]   with fill in the blank, incurable disease of some sort,
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.480]   Alzheimer's, ALS, whatever it is.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.200]   How do I cope with that?
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.120]   How does the truth come to bear on this?
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.720]   Bill?
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.200]   - Again, you're going to go to trusting God.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:22.120]   Some have had that, heard those words, trust God.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:30.880]   I was in a foreign country and heard those words, trust God.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.000]   That's what you have to believe.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.840]   - Very quickly.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.800]   - I'll defer.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.880]   - Well, I mean, something like that.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.680]   There's so many different nuances,
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.080]   but ultimately, you first start with their faith.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.400]   Are they really believers?
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.160]   And I know that seems like such a,
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.960]   it can become such a difficult thing at times.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.800]   You have somebody in your church for a long time,
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.540]   and they're going through a hardship,
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.040]   and as you look at that, you might sit there and go,
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.520]   well, let's go back over first the truth
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.580]   before we get into the particulars of your situation.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.220]   Yes, of course, this is hard,
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.220]   but what does God teach us about our faith?
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.000]   What does God teach us about perseverance?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.680]   And you might find out oftentimes that,
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.320]   I mean, you know that there's goats and sheep in your flock.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.520]   You know there's no question.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.740]   And after you establish that,
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.700]   they sometimes will come to the realization
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.520]   of what their faith is, and therefore,
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   those obstacles become not so incredibly difficult anymore
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.720]   because they realize it's the burden
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.160]   of suffering like Christ.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.520]   And if they are believers, then you can get
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.560]   into the specific application of, yes, like you said,
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.100]   trusting the Lord with all your heart,
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.200]   leaning not on your own understanding.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.960]   I taught through the book of Job for 60 messages,
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.640]   and at the end of the book, as you know,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.240]   Job through the whole time is complaining
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.560]   and lifting his fist and is being barraged
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.720]   by all these different teachers giving him the implication
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.920]   that he was the one that sinned,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.760]   and therefore, this is why this has happened.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.440]   And at the end, God comes in in the famous monologue,
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.880]   longest portion of God speaking in the Bible,
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.480]   and he never gives him an answer.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.680]   He never tells him why.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.360]   He never tells him why his family was destroyed.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.800]   He never tells him why his health was devastated.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.360]   He never tells him why everything was taken from him.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.760]   He just says, I am God, and where were you
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.480]   when I did all of this?
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.720]   And that's a lesson.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.120]   That's a lesson that I've actually taught to people
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.740]   in the hospital when their little girl was sick
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:34.720]   and has a form of cancer, and the in-laws have come
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.640]   into town and were speaking about that.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.480]   And I say because God says the answer to the issue
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.880]   is I am God.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.880]   And then we'd have to go down the elevator with them,
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.800]   walk them to their parking space, and they're silenced
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.520]   because they don't even want to talk to me
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.440]   because they think I've been so insensitive and so harsh
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.920]   because I didn't give them an answer
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.480]   other than what the scripture says,
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.280]   which is we submit to God.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.200]   This is God's will, and we know he's righteous and good,
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.160]   and there is no answer other than trust him.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   So it puts us in a situation where making sure,
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.960]   first, they're saved to the degree that we can,
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.720]   and then administering the truth,
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.240]   and then actually being prepared for being misunderstood
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.080]   and just prayerful and hoping
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.720]   that the Lord softens their heart.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.560]   >> Can I say something to this? >> Yes, go ahead.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.780]   >> I think this is important, too.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.620]   Truth triumphs.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.960]   We're hearing a lot of excellent preaching
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.720]   about these things.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.000]   We are men who believe truth.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.360]   But as a pastor, learn that you don't always
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.260]   have to give an answer.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.100]   >> True.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.400]   >> Here's something else you can do.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.280]   Someone comes to me, and I've had it before,
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.720]   and I've had this particular pastoring for those 20 years.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.400]   I don't have to have a solution.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.940]   Silence can be ministry for someone.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.880]   Hold their hand.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.640]   I'm there with you.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.200]   Don't think that somehow you have to walk them through
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.640]   what I just walked through in 1 Timothy.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.320]   Then you're an expositor now because you've given them
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.160]   all these wonderful biblical answers.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.200]   Be quiet for a while.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.520]   Cry with somebody for a while is what you need to do.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.720]   >> That's the best thing that Job's friends did.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.920]   The only good thing they did.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.760]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.880]   Yeah, so be careful, guys, in thinking that,
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.920]   so, okay, I'm a believer in truth.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.360]   Okay, I've got a Romans, what, Romans 8:28.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.200]   I've got a good job.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.020]   I've got to do this.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:22.860]   I have to say that.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.000]   I have to say that.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.200]   No, just, what are you feeling?
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.480]   >> We have an Alzheimer's support ministry
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.220]   here at Grace Church.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:35.020]   We've had people who have gone through that route.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.700]   We've had families that deal with it.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.140]   We've been meeting for about something like 11 years.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.340]   We've seen something like 20 people.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.460]   We took stock this week to try to think through.
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.220]   When you get this kind of word,
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.900]   you will become a theologian, one way or another.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.900]   You will either be a theologian that is solidly biblical
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.060]   and right and good, or you'll be a bad theologian.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.140]   You'll be blaming God.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.740]   One way or another.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.460]   So, focusing on truth is sometimes extremely important.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.240]   We've looked at the reality of aging.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.180]   This last time we met, we looked at the importance
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.060]   of being created in the image of God, the imago dei.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.980]   How is it that we treat the individual,
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.380]   the family who's going through that?
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.100]   We remember that they are in the image of God.
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.320]   We remember the reality of the fall.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.580]   Truth helps.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.740]   Sometimes it's the only help that you're going to have
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.280]   when you're going through that crisis.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.820]   Next question, pastor.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.900]   And this is actually a pastor who's giving the question.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.540]   I've given everything I've had, I could,
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.780]   to the sermon I just preached.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:51.360]   Time away from my family, time away from my kids.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.320]   I worked hard into the evening.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.860]   I poured out my heart, and I go into the office
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.960]   on Monday morning, and I've got half a dozen emails
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.380]   from people who listen to me,
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.200]   and they're just ripping me apart.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.040]   Or you could change the scenario and say,
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.320]   I've been counseling this couple
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.160]   for the longest period of time.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.200]   Now I open up the newspaper, or I turn on the internet,
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.100]   and I see my name being just ripped to shreds.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.300]   Never thought of that.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.420]   Never thought of that.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:29.260]   How does truth triumph?
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.220]   How does truth help you to cope in that?
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.040]   Tom.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:39.000]   - I'm gonna do something a little bit different here.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.380]   I, not that I don't know the answer,
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.780]   'cause I'm just gonna do what Carl says and be silent.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.980]   - Giving Bill time to think.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.340]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.300]   - I don't know the answer, Tom, so please.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.500]   - I would, I really want to, I'm not trying to forgo it,
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.740]   but I think we only have like 20 something minutes.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.260]   I want to hear from you guys.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.660]   I want to hear questions that you have,
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.860]   and if that's your question, I'd love to answer it,
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.180]   but I'd love to know what's on your all's hearts, too.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.740]   So when you come for a question and answer,
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.800]   I want it to be at least partially towards you as well.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.660]   Is that okay?
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.860]   So do you have a question?
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.100]   If you could walk up to the mics
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.640]   and ask something for us for the last 20 minutes
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.900]   so that we can, I want to know what's on your heart,
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.220]   and if your heart is about those emails,
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.820]   then I'd just say be silent, be kind.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.800]   The longer the email, the shorter the response.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.640]   That's what I say.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.380]   - All right, so we've got an answer.
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.860]   I was gonna overrule the brother.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.700]   - That's the answer.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.100]   - All right. - There you go.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.980]   - Committed to Christ.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.860]   - All right.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:32.700]   - Thank you.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.340]   - I wanted to know how Grace Church
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:38.740]   handles a divisive person, or identifies a divisive person
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.740]   versus somebody that's hard to handle.
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.700]   And especially, too, if they want to come back
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:47.100]   to your church, is there a re-matriculation?
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.480]   And as far as the, when they first come to Grace Church,
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:57.320]   I've heard good that they don't have to subscribe
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.920]   to everything in the doctrinal statement perfectly,
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.280]   'cause you want to give people
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.640]   that are new to the scripture more time.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.080]   This church is by me in New York,
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.960]   where they have the 1689 Confession,
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.840]   and you gotta subscribe to it
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.080]   as soon as you come to the church.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.420]   So speak to those issues for me.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.260]   - Gentleman?
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.880]   - I think for the divisive person, if I may speak to that,
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.560]   I mean, Titus 3.10, they would be put out of the church.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.540]   - Some of the characteristics?
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.580]   - Yeah, that person who is divisive, you know, divisive.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.340]   What is a divisive person?
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.980]   They would be calling up others
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.380]   and saying the pastor did this,
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.780]   or the pastor's wife did this,
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.260]   or they're talking about the doctrine then.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.340]   They could be divisive with the doctrine.
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.180]   Those kinds of things, they should be put out of the church.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.640]   Matter of fact, we did it in one week once,
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.300]   where the fellow said that on a Sunday,
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.980]   and next Sunday he was gone.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.660]   Because you don't want the church to be divided.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.580]   That's one thing.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.100]   How do you get 'em back?
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.180]   How do you get 'em back?
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.380]   That's gonna take some time.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.420]   The elders are gonna have to sit down with him
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.580]   and talk with him, or her, and work through the issues.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.740]   It's not just one sitting that you spend 15, 20,
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.100]   an hour minute, an hour with them.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.560]   You need to spend time, because you wanna make sure
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.180]   the person that's coming back
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.260]   actually knows what they did wrong-going.
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.620]   And some of 'em don't understand that sometimes.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.260]   They can have doctrinal differences.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.560]   You know, if you wanna believe in certain things,
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.460]   that's okay, there are certain key doctrines
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.060]   that they must believe.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.940]   It's like, I had this couple for counseling once,
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.500]   and I asked for their testimony.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.820]   He's like, "Al, give me your testimony."
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.860]   And I'm in my mind going, "I don't know."
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.540]   The guy gave me his testimony, and they said,
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.660]   "But I don't believe that Jesus is God."
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.180]   I said, "You just made that easy for me.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.460]   "You're not a Christian."
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.860]   I mean, I did that immediately.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.940]   He said, "You're not a," he started arguing.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.020]   I said, "We'll get to that, okay, we'll get to that.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.360]   "We'll talk about that."
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.020]   But you obviously have a terrible marriage.
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.420]   Let's work on that a little bit.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.220]   But let's get that.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.100]   You understand, you're not a Christian.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.740]   So I think those are the kinds of things.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.580]   - Guys, wanna add to anything?
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.780]   - Well, you asked a question about re-matriculation.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.700]   If they're repentant, sure.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.420]   But what Bill is saying, observation based on
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:11.420]   the gravity of why they left, and that may take longer,
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.780]   could be a shorter period of time,
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.740]   based on how repentant they are.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.400]   We wanna restore, Galatians, we wanna restore.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.680]   We wanna set the bone in order again.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.720]   But we have to look out for the flock.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.000]   - Factious and divisive conduct, by the way,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.840]   is recognized as a public sin.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   Calvin points this out, that will require quicker action
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.440]   to protect the flock on the part of the elders.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.160]   - A lady once said to me that she didn't believe
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.280]   although we believe the grace.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.120]   I said, "What do you believe that we don't?"
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.760]   She said, "Speaking in tongues."
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.340]   I said, "Well, you can become a member still."
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.460]   She wanted to become a member.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:52.300]   "But you just don't go around professing that as doctrine."
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.780]   Three years later, she walks up to me,
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.940]   she says, "Well, I believe like you do."
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.660]   I said, "Can you please tell me what I believe?"
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.740]   I want you to tell me and articulate that.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.500]   And she said, "Well, I realize speaking in tongues
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.820]   "is not something for today."
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.240]   - Sure, if we can make the distinction,
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.340]   we believe that if you're part of the body of Christ,
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.580]   you, at least in theory, should be able to be a part
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.660]   of our church, a member of our church.
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.840]   That does not mean that you're going to be asked
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:20.680]   to teach a Bible study or lead a fellowship group.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.520]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.340]   - All right, thank you.
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.020]   Over here, Chris. - Over here, Chris.
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:24.860]   - Hi, thank you.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.620]   - There we go.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.180]   - Hi, I had a question in...
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.740]   - Okay. - Okay.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.060]   - In a conference about truth triumphs,
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.540]   there's definitely big theological differences
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.500]   between John MacArthur and John Piper.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.540]   So, and then you have another category
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.900]   of like Romans 14 issues of conscience issues.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.980]   So, how do you stand for the truth dogmatically,
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.740]   but also leave the door open for disagreements
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.740]   on other matters and then disagreements on conscience issues?
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.600]   - Well, something that it's kind of alluded to
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.300]   by the first man's question as well is,
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.300]   we have a statement here that's been very specifically
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:07.360]   called what we teach, not what we believe,
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.660]   because we have thousands of people here
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.580]   that might believe different things.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.420]   But this is what we teach from the pulpit.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.860]   So, that's a very important distinction right off the bat.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.460]   So, yes, there's differences
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.760]   between John MacArthur and John Piper.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.620]   And we used to joke about the fact
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.260]   when R.C. would come here and preach
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.640]   that we'd love to have him come here and preach,
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.860]   but he wouldn't join the church
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.060]   because he wouldn't want to join our church
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.220]   because we wouldn't let him teach.
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.220]   So... (audience laughing)
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:39.460]   And he wouldn't want to
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.260]   'cause there's no way he'd wanna join a church
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.980]   that wasn't a preterist.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.840]   Anyway, so, but the point being is,
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.600]   so we can, as Bill said, as Carl has alluded to as well,
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.860]   you can come here and believe our soteriology,
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.380]   you can believe different aspects
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.220]   of the doctrine of sin, et cetera,
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.300]   but when it comes to some things,
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.740]   and it's always eschatology and it's always the gifts,
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.260]   that's what it boils down to.
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.940]   Sometimes it has to do, lately,
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.980]   with some aspects of the atonement,
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.460]   but usually it's those two things.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:13.460]   Then we try to say we're all in process of learning.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.520]   If you have a teachable spirit,
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.980]   I think this might be what you're asking, I'm not sure,
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.140]   then you can, of course, be here
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.420]   and we wanna come alongside.
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.700]   If you become divisive
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.340]   or you wanna teach a Bible study, like we said,
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.660]   or you want to make your stand,
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.740]   then you're not gonna be happy here.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.580]   Why would you be here?
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:32.700]   You wanna go someplace else.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.620]   People go, well, you're the only Reformed church
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.460]   that's in the neighborhood or in the area, maybe the state,
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.820]   and we're sitting there saying, well, that might be true,
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.180]   but can we just agree, while you're here,
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:46.020]   on those things, like the deity of Jesus,
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.060]   like the doctrine of atonement,
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.420]   and not major on those things that are secondary
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.340]   until they become primary in your mind
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.140]   and then we have to address them.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.700]   And that takes a lot of sensitivity
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.060]   to the nuances of that.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.920]   That's not a hard and fast thing.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.020]   That's through hours of counseling and talking to people
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.720]   and trying to be sensitive to that.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.560]   - 1 Corinthians 15 talks about matters of first importance.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.180]   And you mentioned Romans 14,
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:16.100]   and you can see some of the matters outlined there
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.180]   that we would probably not consider
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.100]   to be of first or primary importance.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.620]   Next question, over here.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:26.020]   - Yeah, I would love to know from each one of you,
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.980]   just like, y'all have been doing pastoral ministry
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:31.980]   for so long, and I'm pretty young, I'm 24,
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.200]   and I'm just curious why each one of you
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.660]   has done pastoral ministry
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:40.700]   and why you have chosen to stay in it for so long.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:45.380]   - Oh, well, that's fairly simple in one sense.
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.300]   It's a calling.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.700]   It's a calling.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.300]   My life was on a very different pathway
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.020]   when I was in college, and the Lord saved me
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.500]   and totally changed my career thought,
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:02.140]   things that I was gearing to do since I was about so tall,
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.580]   and I could not ignore it.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:09.420]   And so it sought me out, and then what happened in life
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:14.340]   is that there was a transference of what I was desiring
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.620]   into now what I desired.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.620]   And that desire now overwhelms me, and it keeps me.
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.580]   And as Paul would say,
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.540]   "The love of Christ controls him."
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:31.260]   So now, because it's been shed abroad in our hearts
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.140]   and shed abroad in my heart,
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:36.660]   now I am, like Paul would say to Timothy,
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:41.020]   "No soldier in active service entangles himself
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.040]   "in the affairs of everyday life
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.900]   "so that he may please the one who enlisted him."
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.340]   So now that I've been enlisted as a new soldier,
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.180]   because that's what I wanted to do,
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.580]   make a career in the military,
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.540]   and I was headed down that path,
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.000]   the Lord says, "No, you will fight another type of battle."
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.220]   So why do I remain?
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.100]   Because I'm still enlisted.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.940]   And the problem with the soldier,
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.740]   there's something that's called AWOL.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:14.260]   You cannot go AWOL, which means you're away without leave.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:17.280]   And the only leave that I'll get is heaven.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.900]   So that's it, I'll do this as long as I can.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.660]   It may not be in the same capacity, but I'll still do it.
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:26.380]   - Have any former Marines in here?
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.040]   Marine Corps motto?
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.980]   - Simplify. - Simplify.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.640]   - What's it mean?
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.820]   - Always faithful. - Always faithful.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.260]   - That's right. - Yes.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:38.420]   - Okay. - For myself in 1982,
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:42.220]   I got saved to Montreal, Canada on a business trip.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.800]   And I had no idea what that meant, getting saved.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.140]   I mean, I had no idea what it meant, reading a Bible.
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.940]   I had never seen one before.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.240]   All of those kinds of things.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.380]   And instead of divorcing my wife
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.500]   when I was coming back home to California,
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.500]   which I was going to do,
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.780]   so I gotta find out how to be a husband.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.120]   I gotta find out how to be a father.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.220]   I gotta learn how to do all these things.
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:07.300]   So I got somebody to start speaking into my life,
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.460]   right here at Grace Community Church.
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:13.620]   By the way, the lady in Canada's pointed me to this church.
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.260]   So that's what I did.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.780]   And when I was meeting with this man,
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.460]   he poured his life into me.
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.740]   He taught me these things.
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:25.540]   And so when these master seminaries started,
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:29.780]   I said to my wife, "I think I've been called."
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:32.340]   She says, "I don't know how to play the piano."
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.380]   I said, "Don't worry about the piano."
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.000]   She said, "But I don't have a flower dress."
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:38.840]   - We'll get you lessons.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.980]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.740]   - And she said, "I don't have a flower dress."
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.500]   I said, "I can take care of that."
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.260]   But that's what, and why do I stay?
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.980]   I stay because I see God's people being helped.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:52.980]   I see people getting saved.
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:56.380]   Stop from getting a divorce, stop from doing sin.
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.040]   I love to see that.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.780]   And my wife and I rejoice with that regularly in our home
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:04.140]   on a Sunday afternoon when we have people over.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.180]   - Tom?
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.580]   - Well, first of all, what a great question
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.540]   from a 24-year-old. - Yeah, that's right.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.260]   - And I pray that that's on your heart.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.620]   I'm sure that's why you're asking the question.
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:18.300]   I wanted to be a pastor when I was five years old.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.540]   The only problem was I wasn't saved till I was 30.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:30.620]   So I think for me it's been trying to catch up
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.740]   for lost time. - Sure.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.460]   - But honestly, if you have a heart for people,
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.940]   you're gonna be, just to be full disclosure,
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.060]   you're gonna be hurt, you're gonna be wounded.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.740]   There's a lot of disappointment.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.500]   In fact, I'd say the closer sometimes you feel
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.360]   that you're getting to a breakthrough with someone,
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.360]   the quicker you can find out that they will malign you,
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.460]   turn from you, and then-- - Sure.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.260]   - It's very painful at times.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.420]   But there are those moments where God supports you
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.500]   in your own soul and in prayer,
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:03.440]   and also from others coming alongside from time to time.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.660]   In fact, just real quick, I was just getting my coffee.
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.820]   This is such a funny thing.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:11.580]   And this young man comes up to me, he says, "Pastor Tom."
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:12.940]   And I said, "Yes," he goes.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:15.820]   He goes, "Well, time has certainly been hard on you
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.820]   "the last 10 years." (congregation laughing)
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.380]   I said, you know, "Bless you, brother.
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.060]   "Be warm and be filled and get out of my way."
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.380]   No, I didn't say that. (congregation laughing)
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.180]   And it kind of threw me,
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.020]   'cause I've never had that compliment.
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:36.020]   And he said, "I was in your preaching lab 10 years ago,
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:40.000]   "and when I came up to preach, you told me to sit down
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.380]   "and come back only when I was prepared."
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:44.220]   And I'm thinking, that's why he said that.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.060]   (congregation laughing)
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.640]   And then he said, "Thank you so much for telling me that,
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.980]   "because I wasn't ready."
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.540]   So sometimes it takes a while for that to come,
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.060]   and that encouraged, 10 years for me.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.860]   Of course, by God's grace, I didn't remember who he was,
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.720]   'cause I blocked those things out.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.660]   But so-- - And Tom, you still don't.
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.300]   - Yeah, but what an encouragement,
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.620]   and I pray for your encouragement.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:10.380]   - I was in college, and I distinctly remember the evening.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:14.940]   Somehow or other, one evening, the passage, John 21,
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.420]   "Feed my sheep."
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:20.340]   You know, the three times repeated phrase,
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.380]   just began to drum itself into my mind,
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:27.020]   and I have never fully been able to get that out of my mind.
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:30.740]   And that, I think God used to start pointing me
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:31.820]   in the direction.
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.760]   I'd been a preacher's kid, and yet, at that point in time,
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.260]   it started moving me in the direction.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.740]   It takes a while to be able to see
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:43.980]   how it all gets implemented, but that passion is there,
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:48.000]   that realization, Acts 20, the Holy Spirit,
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.140]   despite the fact that some men connive themselves
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:54.740]   into the position, the Holy Spirit makes men elders.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.980]   And when we are put in that position, we stay at our post.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:58.820]   Semper fi.
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.340]   - One last thought, real quick, though, before he leaves.
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.300]   Spurgeon's lecture to my students--
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.300]   - I just bought it today.
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.340]   - Okay, on calling.
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:08.140]   He has a great section on calling.
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:10.260]   - And I'll tell you what else, since about calling,
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.260]   something that impacted me when I first came
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:17.020]   to the seminary, Albert Martin, the call to the ministry.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:21.180]   Wow, every man should listen to that.
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.220]   The call to the ministry, Albert Martin.
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:25.060]   - And if you start listening to Albert Martin,
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.100]   you wonder whether you should go into the ministry.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.220]   - Yeah, you're right.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.500]   - We got a brother over here.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.780]   - Brothers, thank you for your wisdom.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:34.620]   I have a question.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.700]   So, you know, when you get saved, right,
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:39.180]   you start reading the Bible, and this is amazing, right?
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.580]   You start learning and growing,
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:44.220]   and then you start discovering all these different truths
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.220]   and theologies and just deepening that, right?
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.820]   And then, you know, 10 years will pass.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.540]   You've read your Bible every year.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:54.820]   You've read your Bible 10 years, 10 times, 20 times,
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:57.780]   maybe 30 times, and sometimes you kind of get
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.940]   the curse of knowledge where you know
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.260]   what the next page is gonna say.
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.060]   You know what the next chapter contains.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.040]   You've preached through it, right?
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.980]   How do you prevent it from just being,
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.500]   I'm reading this to preach, to serve,
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.020]   but I'm reading it for my soul, for my spirit.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.540]   How do you rekindle that?
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.340]   - Sure, yeah, that's a great question.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:19.020]   You know, I teach a course at the seminary.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:20.180]   It's an elective.
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:22.620]   It's called Pastoral Holiness.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:27.300]   And we address the issue of how does one maintain
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.220]   a spiritual life in the ministry.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.380]   And one thing is that you have to take care of your own soul.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.820]   There has to be a delight.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.220]   You have to cherish the Lord.
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:43.220]   You have to believe what the psalmist did
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:47.060]   in Psalm 37 and four, delight yourself in the Lord.
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.280]   You have to believe what the psalmist said in Psalm 27,
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.500]   that he wants to behold the beauty of God
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.740]   and the gaze at his beauty in the temple.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.500]   There has to be that sense of I need my soul
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.680]   to be nourished for my people.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.700]   So one reason you do it is not simply
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:09.700]   for an academic exercise and even to prepare a servant.
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:12.640]   You do it because first, you are a child of God.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.660]   Before I had a call to the ministry,
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.560]   I was simply a child of God.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.380]   And so I have to nurture my life just as a child.
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:26.060]   And what happens with preachers, they can learn too much
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:29.520]   and they forget what is absolutely important,
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:33.460]   which is first, I'm his child.
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.580]   Let me behave like a child.
[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:39.220]   Let me sit at the feet of my father.
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:42.100]   Let me cherish Jesus Christ and his death.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:47.860]   Let me be appalled if I preach on hell
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:51.460]   and I don't have, like Whitfield said, tears in my eyes.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:54.540]   Let me be like an Owen who said
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.360]   when he felt a sense of worldliness,
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.020]   that he would read like just 40 chapters of the Bible
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.580]   because he felt worldly.
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:08.020]   And this is Owen as well with his communion with God.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:11.940]   So we do this out of communion with the living God
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.960]   because of a relationship.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.300]   And so it's not just another page.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.940]   It's not just another sermon.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:22.900]   This is a relationship that you're nurturing
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.540]   with the living God.
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.260]   And we have to keep that in front of us.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.100]   - Tom?
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.020]   - I just think exactly what he said.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.860]   But to add to that, when you're saying
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:35.340]   I'm just preparing sermons and I get dry,
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.700]   you know, the big thing that I deal with,
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.940]   'cause sometimes on a Saturday,
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:41.260]   I'll listen to six or seven sermons that I have to critique.
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.460]   My whole Saturday is called Sanctification Saturday.
[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:45.540]   (laughing)
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.460]   And it's just sermon after sermon.
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.820]   And my number one critique many times
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:51.100]   is not their exegesis,
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:53.220]   is not the fact that they didn't get the point,
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.940]   but the fact that they speak it
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.580]   as if it's some kind of flat, unaffected.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.380]   And so my question always goes back to them.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:03.100]   I go, how much time did you spend really grappling
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:05.780]   with your own heart in this text?
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.860]   So you might be giving sermons every week,
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.540]   but, and they may be biblical,
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:14.060]   but you're not really allowing yourself.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.860]   I think John MacArthur says he has two positions
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:19.460]   when he studies, either this position or this position.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:21.500]   He's either here or here.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.700]   And I said so many people don't spend enough time
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:27.660]   with their back contemplating their own life in the text.
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:28.500]   I don't know about you guys,
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.340]   and I'm not trying to make anything about me,
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:33.260]   but I cry every time I prepare for a sermon
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.460]   because I'm a rotten sinner
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:37.780]   that needs God's grace every moment of my life,
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:38.620]   and I'm ready.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.180]   So if you can go through a sermon and be dry,
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.220]   what's the old saying that Moody said?
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:44.940]   This book will keep you from sin,
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.340]   and sin will keep you from this book.
[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:48.940]   And so just remember that
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.860]   and allow God to break your heart down
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:54.900]   because otherwise you might be effective in word,
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.500]   but not in heart.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.060]   And I think your people can tell that, too,
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:00.380]   but God obviously knows.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:01.740]   - Sheldon.
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.860]   - You know, a gentleman once said to me
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.580]   that I study the word of God
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:07.180]   because I get paid to do that.
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:11.420]   He did, and I said, well, it's priceless.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.860]   So you study the word of God because it's priceless.
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:15.860]   I'm gonna learn more.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:18.900]   I'm gonna grow to be the man of God that he wants me to be.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.140]   And I know I'm not the man of God
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.020]   that he wants me to be yet.
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.860]   And so I study for that reason.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.100]   Now, when you hit Leviticus,
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.740]   you go, why am I reading this?
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.300]   Yeah, there's a reason for reading it.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.620]   You see God's exactness.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:36.820]   You see God's masterfulness in putting things together.
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:39.380]   That's what you have to see is another aspect of God.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:41.300]   It's not always the same.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.380]   And so see it for those kinds of things
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:46.700]   that it can just give you a different picture of who he is.
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.580]   - One of the things that I love most about our pastor,
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:53.860]   he has been pastoring for 55 years.
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:55.260]   He was a preacher's kid.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.620]   He grew up.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.980]   He still is excited about finding new things.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.380]   And that is manifest for those of us
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:05.300]   who have the chance to be close to him and to talk to him.
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:08.580]   As a practical matter, you're gonna laugh when I say this,
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:12.460]   allow yourself the luxury of periodically buying a new Bible.
[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:17.020]   Sometimes it's enjoyable just to be able to look at that,
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:19.500]   get lost, think about the texture,
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.660]   but then focus on the words.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.220]   Regardless though, I'm gonna take you back
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:29.060]   to what Paul tells Timothy, 2 Timothy 3.
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:34.180]   And it's actually in the imperative mode, verse 14.
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:38.380]   "As for you, you must continue.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.720]   "You must continue in what you have learned
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.720]   "and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.860]   "and how from childhood you have been acquainted
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:52.100]   "with the sacred writings which are able to make you wise
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:54.500]   "for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ."
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.180]   We do not have the option of not continuing
[00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.100]   in the study of the words.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.380]   Pray that God will enlighten your minds.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.920]   Pray that God will show you.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.060]   We have the expression at times in our culture,
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.300]   stay hungry.
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.860]   Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.940]   It's an ongoing present reality.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.780]   Stay hungry.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.620]   Do we have any other questions?
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:17.980]   - We have one more here. - It's okay.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:18.820]   - All right.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:23.620]   Aside from the scriptures, for you as pastors,
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.300]   what would be the one book that you would commend
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.860]   to all of the pastors? - Oh, great question.
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:29.980]   Bill?
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.260]   - Depends upon what week you're talking about.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.220]   - Yeah. (audience laughing)
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.340]   - I read lots and lots of books.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.060]   One of 'em, "The Power of Christian Contentment"
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.840]   just recently has touched my heart.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.560]   I've fallen in love with that.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.660]   But I also like to read biographies.
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.580]   - Yes.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:51.580]   - And so I'm reading those kinds of things.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:55.740]   I've got one now about a guy called R.C. Sproul.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.020]   We've been talking about him before,
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.980]   and I'm reading that, that Nichols put together.
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.460]   And so I'm always reading.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.840]   I've always got something.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.580]   And then the war with children just came out,
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.300]   a war against children just came out,
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.780]   and I'm reading that as well.
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:10.940]   So I just like to read.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.820]   - Is there one particular book
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.780]   that you have read in your life
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:18.620]   that stands out as perhaps the most important thing
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.060]   you've read outside of the Bible?
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:23.260]   - Outside of the Bible, whatever I'm reading.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.300]   I mean, it's just, I gotta leave it there
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:30.000]   because I have so many that I've been through.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.740]   If you wanna talk about missions, I've got books.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.340]   You wanna talk about history, I've got books.
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.260]   And that's, well, I'll leave it there.
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.220]   - Okay.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.700]   Tom.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.540]   - Boy.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:39.380]   - Let's get to Tom, and then we'll get to you.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.200]   - Are you Tom?
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.040]   I don't know.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.580]   - Yeah, oh boy, he's thinking about me.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:46.260]   No, without a doubt, it's the Martin Lloyd-Jones' book,
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.260]   "Sermons on the Mount."
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:51.260]   It is, I've gone through that so many times.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.260]   I discipled men through that book.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.700]   If you wanna have your heart reacquainted
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.140]   with the most famous sermon our Lord ever gave,
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.420]   go to Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.780]   It is priceless.
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.660]   It is so rich.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.500]   So I can't commend that enough.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.960]   That's the book I always go back.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.280]   Because even just going through the Beatitudes,
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.540]   your heart will get refreshed and convicted,
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.860]   and you'll start to just meditate, and it's wonderful.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.700]   - Fantastic. - Wow, that's hard.
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:24.300]   Whitfield, about Dalamore.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.860]   - Oh yeah, biography.
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.940]   - Yeah, biography.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.420]   Yeah, theological, going all the way back
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.900]   to my young days in the faith, knowing God.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.460]   Yeah, Packer.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.980]   Great impact on me.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.560]   For me, the book, the one book that has had
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.560]   probably the most overriding influence over the years,
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.800]   what are you gonna guess I'm saying?
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.720]   - Calvin's Institute.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.760]   - You got it, absolutely.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.800]   - I know this man.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.100]   - And read both the first one and the last one.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:58.580]   In the first one, he's fire all the way.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:02.420]   A sense of humor that you couldn't use today.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:09.120]   In his last edition, reasoning precise, deep, intense.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:15.780]   - Martin Lloyd-Jones did a course of reading
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.140]   that I had stumbled into myself without realizing
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.160]   that the doctor had recommended it.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.740]   You read, recommend a book of doctrine,
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.740]   maybe a selection of sermons,
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.020]   a commentary on a particular book,
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:32.020]   alternate that with a book of biography,
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.660]   a great man in the history of the church,
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.220]   Dalamore's Biography of Whitfield.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.580]   - It's just unbelievable.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:42.040]   - Two volumes set, if you look close enough,
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.100]   you'll find a great abuse of church discipline.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:49.280]   Dalamore writes about how Wesley disciplined a woman out
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.000]   because she did not respond to his romantic overtures.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.240]   Sense of humor, but you'll see how truth gets ironed out.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.360]   - Don't try it, guys.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.200]   - Don't try it.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.640]   (audience laughing)
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.960]   - Yeah, let's not have you come back next year.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:11.020]   But how truth gets ironed out over the course of time.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.600]   Read the biography of Athanasius,
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.460]   some of the history of the church,
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.880]   and then go back to another book on church doctrine.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.160]   Studies in the Sermon on the Mount is fantastic.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.620]   But go back and forth.
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.620]   Make sure you know the Puritans.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:29.460]   - Amen.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.600]   - Okay? - Yeah, amen.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.660]   - Let's see, tell me a choice of,
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.580]   top recommended Puritan, let's give me a choice of names.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.420]   - Sibbes.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.340]   - Sibbes. - Yeah, Richard Sibbes.
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.180]   - Yeah.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.000]   - Watson.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:39.840]   - What's that?
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.680]   - Watson. - Watson.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.500]   - Okay.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.340]   Owen. - Owen.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.660]   - Owen, you want to read the abridgments?
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.500]   Okay.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.500]   (audience laughing)
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.020]   Let's close in prayer.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.700]   Father in heaven, again, Lord,
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.300]   I thank you for each of these men.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:53.140]   Thank you for the fun that we've had this afternoon.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:56.060]   Thank you for their passion for Christ.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.980]   Father, I pray that your hand of blessing,
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:01.120]   chastening, and direction would rest upon each of them.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.580]   Father, may we be found faithful.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.500]   May there be none of us who would in any way
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:10.760]   bring disgrace or disrepute to the gospel of Christ.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.420]   We love you and we thank you, Lord, for the privilege.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.320]   We look forward to the day when we hear you say,
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.580]   well done, good and faithful servant.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.300]   Enter into the joy of the Lord.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.660]   Father, thank you for this privilege.
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:27.460]   Guide us in all we do through the rest of the day, amen.
