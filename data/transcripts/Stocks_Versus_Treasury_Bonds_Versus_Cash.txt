[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.360]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai and greetings from Sonoma, wine country, California.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.180]   Our kids are out from school this week, so we decided to come up and it's actually snowing.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.200]   That's pretty cool because I don't think my kids have seen snow yet.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.460]   We're too afraid to drive up to Lake Tahoe, which is about three hours and 20 minutes
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.760]   on a very good day and maybe up to eight, nine hours on a bad day.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.840]   That's a no-go with a three-year-old and a five-and-a-half-year-old.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.000]   Sonoma and Napa Valley are only about an hour and a half away from San Francisco, so that's
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.380]   really smooth sailing.
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.000]   So in this episode, I want to talk about buying treasury bonds yielding over 5% because I
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.280]   published a post that was widely read by tens of thousands of people and I came back with
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.240]   some really good feedback from all of you on maybe why we shouldn't buy treasury bonds
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.840]   yielding 5% or why it's not that big of a deal that I didn't really think about and
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.240]   I got some good data points from various people.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.400]   Then I have some more feedback from people who say, "Well, forget about treasuries because
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.000]   I'm willing to invest all of my capital in stocks or 95% plus, even as a retiree."
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.400]   I thought this was quite interesting feedback because that's definitely not my way.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.400]   As I've gotten older and wealthier with more responsibility to children, I've decided to
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.500]   go more and more into capital preservation mode.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.580]   For me, 5%, even with inflation at 6.2% or whatever it is right now, is pretty good because
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.080]   anything above 0% is a positive.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.760]   Sure, I'm not making a real return, but that's better than losing 19% in the S&P 500 in 2022
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.200]   and not making a real return because you are doing a double loss of losing to inflation
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.800]   and losing real money in your stock investments.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.720]   Now in 2023, it's rare to see consecutive down years in the S&P 500, but I do think
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.520]   4,200 on the S&P 500 feels like the top, with the S&P 500 at around 4,000-ish.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.920]   The forward P/E multiple is about 18 times, which is slightly above the long-term medium
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:31.560]   of about 16 times, but that's down from 20 plus times during the bubble year of 2021.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.040]   We've made progress, but it still seems quite difficult to break out to another bull market
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.200]   with the Fed continuing to raise Fed funds rate.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.080]   The terminal rate is probably going to go to 5.25% to 5.5% because the January CPI and
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.720]   PPI numbers were not as good as expected, so they were higher than expected.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.080]   Retail sales was also really strong.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.600]   Job numbers were also really high.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.860]   So it seems like the Fed is going to raise interest rates for longer, and maybe they'll
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:14.880]   stop in May of 2023, and then they might keep the Fed funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5% for another
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.600]   six to 12 months.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.880]   So that's longer than expected.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.640]   That's longer than the S&P 500 rally we've had since October of last year was expecting.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.120]   Therefore, there should be some downward adjustments to the S&P 500, which we've seen after it
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:40.440]   topped out at around 4,195, and then it recently has retrenched back to 3,986.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.200]   But if you invest in treasury bonds with a three-month, six-month, nine-month, or one-year
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.040]   maturity, they're technically called treasury bills, you're going to get a guaranteed annualized
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.880]   5% or higher return now.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.360]   And if you multiply the current S&P 500 level, when I wrote it, it was around 41-something
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360]   by 5%.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.600]   You're going to add 200 points.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.920]   And so you're talking about 4,300-plus when I wrote it, which is above where I think the
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.320]   S&P 500 is going to go for the year.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.040]   And even at 4,000, you times that by 5%, you get 200, so 4,200.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.180]   I think that's kind of the top for this year.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.560]   Who knows the future?
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.640]   But I'm happy to take a risk-free 5% return without having to pay state and local income
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.880]   taxes on that income.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.920]   Let me go through nine reasons quickly on why I don't think I'm going to regret buying
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.840]   treasury bonds, because it does feel like deja vu a little bit.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.600]   Back in 2008, I bought five-year CDs at like 4% to 4.25%.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.000]   I thought it was relatively good as the markets were collapsing.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.600]   It felt good.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.120]   But in retrospect, it would have been better to have invested any of that money I put in
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.440]   CDs into the S&P 500, because the bull market resumed starting in mid-2009.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.440]   But that's hindsight.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.860]   What about forward?
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.860]   Same thing could happen?
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.860]   Yes.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.800]   The same thing could happen, but the duration of the treasury bonds I'm buying, three months
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.280]   to 12 years, is not going to set me up for missing out on years and years of potential
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   upside.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.400]   So, first reason why I won't regret buying treasury bonds.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.600]   And you might be thinking the same thing, too.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.200]   I'm not sure you're deciding between stocks and bonds right now.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.640]   I've been buying a lot of treasury bonds, so much so that it made me wonder whether
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.600]   I will regret buying treasury bonds in the future, and it's made me record this episode
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   for you.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.960]   So, first reason why I don't think I'm going to regret, a 5% return is higher than our
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.460]   safe withdrawal rate.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:54.160]   Our safe withdrawal rate is currently zero, and it's zero because we have online income.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.960]   And if you have a day job, your safe withdrawal rate is also zero because you have day job
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.720]   income and hopefully you're spending less than you make.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:09.080]   Now, even if we had no online income, as true retirees, not fake retirees, our safe withdrawal
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.800]   rate would be between 2% to 3%, and that's lower than the gross 5% yield we would get
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   from treasury bonds.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.120]   So, it's like living for free for one more year, and everybody loves to live for free.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.320]   Two, there's no upcoming big ticket item we want to buy.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.720]   Our car is fine.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.460]   It's only got 40,000 miles.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.940]   We'll drive for two, three more years, no problem, since we only drive about 6,000 miles
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.140]   a year.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.760]   We just bought a decent house in 2020.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.600]   Yes, I always am looking at nicer and nicer homes, but realistically, I don't know, buying
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.160]   another house and having to move and paying all that much more money, it doesn't seem
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.300]   realistic over the next two, three, four years, maybe 10 years.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.280]   If you don't have any large upcoming expenses and all your existing expenses can be covered
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.360]   by cash flow, well, you're probably good for locking up your treasury bond money for up
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.160]   to a year as well.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.960]   Third reason why we won't regret buying treasury bonds, we're happy with what we have.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.200]   We don't desire fancy clothes, jewelry, or watches.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.120]   Our burn rate is pretty low.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:26.340]   We're not taking luxury international vacations, flying private, partly because it seems kind
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.880]   of excessive with a three-year-old and a five and a half-year-old who's probably not going
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.180]   to remember much of their travels.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.840]   We don't have reckless addictions like gambling, drugs, or alcohol that could really burn our
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.320]   money away.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.600]   Four, treasury bonds provide free living for most mortgage holders.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:51.120]   80 plus percent of current mortgage holders have an interest rate below 5%.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.760]   Probably it's like 90 plus percent.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:59.920]   A 5% return pays for our 2.125% primary mortgage rate and then some.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:06.440]   So psychologically, it feels amazing to live for free every time we buy another slug of
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   treasury bonds.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.720]   And yes, I have to technically buy as much in treasury bonds equal to the size of my
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:21.040]   existing mortgage to truly live for free, but actually not really since 5% plus treasury
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.840]   bond yield is more than twice our existing primary mortgage rate.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.240]   So maybe we only have to buy like 60% because of taxes, right?
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.800]   So 60% of the amount of our existing mortgage.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.960]   Regardless, the point is the more you buy treasury bonds psychologically, the better
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.160]   you feel you're heading in the right direction.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:49.160]   Every single slug, $1,000 slug you buy, it's like, oh, $1,000 of your mortgage is getting
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.680]   covered and then some.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.160]   Eventually, we're going to pay off the mortgage.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.480]   And when that time comes, we will hopefully look back and marvel at how cheap home ownership
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.140]   really was, right?
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.440]   Because this investment covers our mortgage and then some.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.140]   And then every single month, we're paying down principal as well.
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.140]   So it's kind of like double winning.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:14.020]   And when it comes to money and achieving financial independence, a lot of it is psychological.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.780]   You want to feel good and you want to always be making progress.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:25.740]   Five, I'm in decumulation mode, partly because I'm going to be 46 years old this year.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.580]   Any return above 0% adds to our net worth because we have our investments and then we
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.560]   have our income, passive income and active income.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.900]   So if someone is in decumulation mode, adding more is contrary to the goal of decumulating
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.300]   and spending more money and giving more money away.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:51.540]   In the past, keeping your cash earning less than 1%, at a point it was like 0.1%, 0.2%,
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.540]   that felt terrible.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:57.100]   However, making 5% plus on your cash feels incredible.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:02.740]   And this is where the commenters came in and highlighted the various money market rates
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.460]   they were receiving from, let's say Vanguard or Fidelity or whatnot.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.820]   And this is something I didn't really think about.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.660]   And I think the commenter is perfect for bringing this up because I took a look on my brokerage
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:20.820]   account Fidelity and they are offering 4.11% to all idle cash.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.420]   And you don't have to reinvest.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.620]   It's just idle.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:29.080]   Fidelity will automatically invest that money in their money market account that pays 4.11%.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.400]   And this is as of February 23rd, 2023.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:42.220]   And a couple of commenters said Vanguard has this money market fund that pays 4.4% or 4.5%.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.160]   So even better.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.780]   Now you have to check with your brokerage whether that idle cash automatically gets
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:54.580]   swept in or reinvested in those money market accounts yielding those figures or if you
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.500]   have to click some buttons to get that.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.020]   So with this in mind, you've got to calculate the difference between the yield you'll get
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.820]   from buying treasury bonds and the yield you'll get by keeping your money in cash.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:13.100]   Now let's say it's about 0.5% to 0.9%.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.340]   Is that significant?
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.700]   To me that's still significant because all you have to do is click some buttons to get
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.220]   that higher yield.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.540]   This is what online brokerage accounts and banks are doing.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.780]   They've got to pay that interest rate to deposited money.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.780]   Right?
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:35.540]   And then they reinvest that money in a hopefully higher yielding investment to profit.
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.780]   This is called the net interest margin for online brokerage accounts and banks.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.420]   This is classic banking 101.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:49.460]   And 0.5% to 0.9% risk-free spread is massive.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:55.580]   And this is one of the reasons why you might be seeing banks encouraging, encouraging more
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:01.940]   depositors to come to them and trying to lure them in with a 4% rate or a 4.5% rate because
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:07.580]   all they do is take your deposits and reinvest it in treasury, risk-free treasury bonds or
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:13.100]   bills yielding 0.5% to 0.9% higher rates.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:18.460]   And if you can accumulate billions and billions of dollars in deposits, you can make a lot
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.980]   of money relatively easily.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:26.140]   So as a financial samurai, I want you to think like a lender, like a bank.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.740]   Why not maximize your cash earnings?
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:35.240]   The liquidity risk is not really that big of a risk with treasury bonds.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.140]   You can buy three months and then in three months, you're just going to get a slug of
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.900]   liquidity back because the treasury bond matures.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:47.500]   And if you just keep on investing every three months and once a week intervals, you're going
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.540]   to get money back every single week.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:56.700]   And worst case, if you needed the liquidity right now and you had no more emergency fund,
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:02.820]   you lost your job, no access to friends or nothing, you can just sell your treasury bonds
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.820]   on the secondary market.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.560]   You'll take a small discount and you'll be fine.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.440]   But once you start investing in treasury bonds and you build that ladder, you're going to
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:17.500]   be surprised, I think, at how quickly that time goes and how much liquidity keeps coming
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.600]   back to you.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.040]   Because again, you're investing in short-term treasury bonds here.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.120]   All right.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.600]   Reason number six why I don't think we're going to regret buying treasury bonds.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:36.880]   We've experienced enough stress and anxiety since 2020 to last, I would say, maybe a decade.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.740]   Life wouldn't have been too difficult if we didn't have two young children.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:46.780]   But we had a pandemic baby December 2019 and then we had a toddler that we pulled from
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:52.460]   school and we had to protect from an invisible enemy for three years now.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.860]   And there's been tremendous mental fatigue buildup.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.020]   I could actually see it in my face.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.820]   I can see it in my energy.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.820]   I'm tired.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.260]   I don't know about y'all, but I'm pretty tired.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:08.060]   When risk assets were appreciating value in 2020 and 2021, the pandemic was more tolerable.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.540]   Hey, at least we're making money.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:18.700]   But then to lose money in 2022 while the pandemic was still going on, that felt terrible.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.700]   At least in the second half of 2022, most of the country started opening up and things
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.220]   started feeling like things are going back to normal.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.660]   When I wrote my 2022 review, it didn't feel that great because there was no net worth
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.900]   progress.
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.060]   Maybe it was up 1%.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.940]   It was basically insignificant.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.820]   And so it didn't feel good working for free.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:48.060]   Now with all the income coming in for 2023, it feels great to be able to lock in a 5%
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:54.380]   guaranteed return and hopefully it would help soften the cushion of existing risk assets
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.660]   in the market if they go down some more in 2023.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:03.580]   We don't know for sure, but psychologically to lock in that 5% guaranteed return on any
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.580]   new cash flow coming in, ah, feels wonderful.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:15.020]   All right, reason number seven, 5% treasury bond yields won't last forever, folks.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.740]   If you think about the time frame of the Fed now, we're talking raising Fed funds rate
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:26.660]   until mid-2023, maybe keeping it there for six months to 12 months.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.560]   So by mid-2024, the rates will start getting cut.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.620]   And if you locked in that 5% for 12 months, starting in the middle of this year, I think
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:43.340]   you're going to therefore outperform for maybe six months or longer.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:49.160]   The one year treasury yield at 5% plus is the highest since July 2007.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.860]   And hopefully it actually takes up a little bit more for the next several months, right,
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.940]   until the middle of the year.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:01.340]   And once those rates no longer start taking up or actually start fading, the value of
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.820]   your existing treasury bonds will go up because it's yielding more than what new treasury
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.860]   bonds can yield.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:14.980]   And so if you actually were able to be more risk-taking and buy a bond fund at yields
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:19.340]   at the top, right, the one year yield at the top, then you'll likely make money on that
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.540]   bond fund as well.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.740]   But that's a little different.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:27.620]   Personally, I'm buying bonds to hold to maturity, to earn that risk-free income and not really
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.940]   sweat about capital risk.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:35.580]   All right, reason number eight, less burden on what to do with your excess cash.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.700]   All of us who are spending less than we make will accumulate excess cash.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.180]   And if you accumulate too much excess cash, it'll start burning a hole in your pocket.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.340]   It's the same feeling for any of y'all who bought an engagement ring and just put it
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.620]   in your pocket.
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:58.040]   You want to propose to your true love because you just can't take the feeling of that engagement
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.780]   ring still sitting in your counter or hidden away.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:06.340]   You just want to get it over with, propose, and hear whether he or she will say yes or
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.340]   not.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.940]   All right, the final reason why I don't think we're going to regret buying treasury bonds
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:18.020]   with a 5% plus yield is because we might outperform the stock market and the real estate market.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:24.360]   If you think about it, the S&P 500, again, is trading at about 18 times forward earnings.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   Earnings are declining.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.860]   So if we stay at this current level, the P/E will go up.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.820]   We still got a Fed who's determined to hike rates.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.040]   And there could be a potential recession, another recession.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   You don't know.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.460]   So while we wait for things to play out, why not earn 5%?
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:48.100]   The real estate market, it's in a downdraft right now, folks.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:54.580]   Mortgage rates are going back up to about 6.8% on the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.860]   So that's going to take away demand.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:03.720]   So I still believe mid-2023 is a great time to try to get some deals for 10% or maybe
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.040]   greater off.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.940]   But the real estate market takes time to go in cycles.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.640]   It takes time to go up, and it takes time to go down.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.320]   So we could easily be waiting another 6 to 12 months for the real estate market to find
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.580]   its bottom.
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:25.940]   So to be able to make 5% risk-free while we wait is just wonderful.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:32.820]   Now if you see some wonderful private or public real estate investment opportunity from a
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:38.300]   very motivated seller who is selling at below what you think the market will bottom out
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.500]   at, I would say go for it.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   Go for it.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.620]   There are many strategies to try to convince people to sell an asset at below what you
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.980]   think the future market value will be.
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.020]   And the same thing goes for some stocks.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.700]   Stocks tend to discount the future 6 to 12 months in advance.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.620]   Nvidia, for example, reported pretty poor results.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:06.260]   And the P multiple, the EBITDA multiple is like at 80 plus times.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.740]   It's really expensive.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:14.020]   But the market is discounting the future, and the stock is up 6 to 7% as we speak right
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.020]   now.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.940]   The final topic worth addressing is whether to take more risk if you've already achieved
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.660]   your target net worth figure.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.700]   So several commenters have said, "I don't believe in treasury bonds.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:33.740]   I'm happy to invest 90% to 100% of my net worth in stocks for the long term."
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.180]   And they say, "Well, Sam, you've already reached financial independence.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.060]   You're good with what you have.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.520]   Why not take more risk?"
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:46.960]   They don't see me investing more in stocks as a risk at all since I already have enough.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:53.360]   And my response is, after decades of living with myself and understanding my emotions
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:00.320]   and my objectives, I simply don't feel like I need to take more risk investing in stocks
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.820]   at this moment.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.340]   I already have about 30% of my net worth in stocks.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.060]   It's a large absolute dollar figure.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:14.560]   I've already got about 50% of my net worth in real estate, which is also a large, larger
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.080]   absolute dollar figure.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.900]   So if risk assets rebound, then great.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.800]   The majority of my net worth will also benefit.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:28.620]   But if risk assets continue to falter or go down, then at least I'll feel better knowing
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.840]   that the new capital that I've reinvested in treasury bonds will hold its value plus
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.080]   5% over the next 12 months.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:43.220]   Everybody has different financial objectives and different asset allocations to match their
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.520]   risk tolerance.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.680]   And for me, this is what I'm comfortable doing.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:54.920]   And what I've also noticed after writing investment-related posts since 2009 is that the more opinionated
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:03.160]   you are about how someone else invests is actually a reflection of your current anxiety
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.600]   about how you are investing your money.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:12.360]   You're trying to justify your decision and you feel uncomfortable that someone else is
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.760]   investing in a different way.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.260]   But you've got to understand that everybody is different.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.800]   Different objectives, different levels of net worth.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.040]   This is something that's also interesting.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   I hear people say, "Well, of course I'm going to invest 100% of my net worth in stocks."
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.000]   They go up 8% to 10% every single year in the long run.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.800]   And sure, you're going to lose some money here and there, but over the long run, you're
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.240]   going to do fine.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.440]   And I agree, over the long run, we'll probably do fine.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.040]   We haven't lost money in the stock market in any 10-plus year stretch.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.360]   However, in the long run, we're also dead.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.840]   I'm 46.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.960]   Maybe I have 10 to 40 years left to live.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.040]   You don't really know.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:04.680]   So as you get closer to older age or the median life expectancy, you start thinking things
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   differently.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.200]   You start thinking about how to spend and give away your money and plan your estate.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:16.560]   The other thing to realize is your risk tolerance is different based on the amount of money
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.000]   you're putting at risk, amount of capital you have.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.080]   So if you have, let's say, 50 grand to invest, yeah, investing 100% in stocks, the S&P 500,
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.760]   might not feel that risky.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:38.680]   But if you have $5 million to invest, maybe investing all $5 million in the S&P 500 is
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.720]   a little bit more difficult.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.920]   And from my experience, I think once you cross about the $1 million threshold, you start
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.880]   wanting to diversify a little.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.480]   $3 million is a little bit different.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.000]   $5 million.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.100]   And then after about $10 million, I mean, $10 million is a lot of money, folks.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.460]   You can earn $500,000 a year risk-free in treasury bonds.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:06.820]   And so that compared to an average person's expenses, I think that's a great life, 500
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.440]   grand, without paying state income taxes.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.220]   And then if you bring that number out further, let's say to $20 million, this is a good thought
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.260]   process to have when deciding where to invest your capital.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:24.420]   If you had $20 million investable capital, you could earn $1 million plus risk-free right
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.620]   now over the next 12 months.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:35.380]   And I would say 99.99% of the population would be happy to earn and live off $1 million gross
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.740]   income for the next 12 months.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.500]   Hopefully this episode has helped you think about risk-free returns, taking risk, and
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:48.460]   how you want to invest your capital and cut up your net worth over the next 12 months.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.660]   Don't let me judge how you should invest your money.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.180]   Just like I don't let anybody make me feel bad about how I invest my money.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:02.460]   We all know ourselves better than anybody else in the world knows us.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.460]   All right, everyone.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.580]   If you enjoyed this episode, I'd love a positive five-star review.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.240]   And if you enjoyed this episode, please share it with others because they'd probably enjoy
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.880]   it as well.
