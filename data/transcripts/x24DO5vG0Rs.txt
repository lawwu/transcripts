[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.680]   Why has God determined it appropriate
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.560]   to establish an eternal unending judgment?
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.360]   And what is the one main sin it is designed to punish?
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.920]   And how are we all made so guilty
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.800]   that this punishment is appropriate
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.400]   and fitting for every human being
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.040]   who is separated from Christ?
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.180]   It's into this very heavy but essential question
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.880]   we find the answer in Romans chapter one.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.960]   The following clip is from a sermon John Piper delivered
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.120]   last year in England at Revive,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.960]   a weekend conference
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.240]   of the Commission Church Planning Network.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.000]   Here's what Pastor John had to say.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.600]   - We never, we never leave God
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   because we value him little.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.960]   We also exchange God because we value something else more.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   Let me say that again, nobody leaves God,
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.520]   forsakes God, abandons God, suppresses God,
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.520]   turns away from God simply because they value him little.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.040]   We always turn away from God
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.280]   because we value something else more,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.280]   which is why it is such a cosmic insult
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.320]   and infinite outrage.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.200]   This is the infinite outrage in the universe
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.200]   that human beings prefer something else to God.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200]   So here we are at verse 22,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.200]   claiming to be wise, they became fools, and here it comes.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.680]   They exchanged the glory of God,
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.520]   the immortal God, for images.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.520]   They became fools and exchanged the glory of God for images.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.280]   Now just think that through 'cause you've all done it
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.560]   and we're tempted to do it every day.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.200]   To exchange something for something
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.320]   means to express a preference, right?
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.360]   You don't exchange something you value supremely
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.900]   for something you value less, never.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.180]   You always exchange something
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.540]   for something that you want instead of it.
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.080]   You don't want that, you want the other thing.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.080]   That's what exchange means, I want the other thing.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.480]   And everybody does that with God.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.440]   We look at his glory, we look at his power,
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.840]   we look at his wisdom, we look at his beneficence,
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.160]   and we don't say thank you, we don't say you're great,
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.040]   we say I am going to trade you
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.160]   for something that I really want.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   That is why hell exists, because it is an infinite sin.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.360]   You can't do anything worse.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.580]   There's nothing worse that can be done.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.460]   Sins are simply expressions of that.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.560]   Sins get all of their evil from that, that's evil.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.960]   What we call evil, hurting each other,
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   that's just little, little expressions of that.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.440]   All the rottenness that we do to each other
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.880]   is deriving its rottenness from the ultimate rot
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   of exchanging God, saying that the infinite creator
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.320]   and the most beautiful reality in the universe,
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.000]   I don't want you, I don't prefer you,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.120]   you're not attractive to me, you're not satisfying to me,
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.920]   I get no pleasure from you, this is my desire,
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.940]   this is my treasure.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.360]   That is evil, that's the meaning of evil.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.640]   And all other evils get their evil from that,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.580]   including the evils of money, sex, and power,
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.480]   which Paul is going to make crystal clear.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.860]   The deepest problem that we're dealing with
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.720]   behind money, behind sex, and behind power
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.560]   is that we all know the supreme value of God.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.200]   We do, everybody does.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   Everybody you'll ever talk to, atheist, skeptic, agnostic,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.120]   secularist, new age, whatever religion,
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.800]   everybody knows the truth, namely,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.000]   God is supremely valuable,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.680]   and everybody prefers something to God.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.680]   Adam and Eve thought they were doing a wise thing
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.680]   when they preferred their way and this fruit
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.680]   over God and His way, and they became fools
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.560]   and were darkened in their understanding,
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.200]   and we've inherited that all the way
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.740]   down to the roots of our being.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.680]   There are two kinds of heart condition in the world,
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.160]   the one that values God overall,
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.120]   and the one that values something else overall.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.720]   The main issue you're gonna be facing
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.400]   as we are meeting together here
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   is whether your hearts are treasuring God supremely
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.160]   above everything else.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.280]   I mean everything evil and everything good.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.400]   All the good things God has given you,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.120]   all the evil things the devil is tempting you with,
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.120]   and I'm saying that more than the good things
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.740]   and more than the evil things, is God your treasure?
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.640]   Is God your satisfaction?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.240]   Is God your delight?
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.440]   Because if He is, money, sex, and power
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.260]   will turn into remarkable potentials in your life.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.880]   And if He's not, money, sex, and power
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   will become unbelievably destructive in your hands.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.100]   - Wow, that is powerful.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.160]   This message was delivered last summer
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.120]   in a series titled Living in the Light
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.320]   with Money, Sex, and Power,
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.080]   four-part series, three messages, and a Q&A.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.040]   This clip was taken from the first message,
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.880]   and they are all on our site at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.200]   Those messages, of course, became the new book,
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.520]   Living in the Light, Money, Sex, and Power,
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.400]   a nice little hardcover available now at Amazon
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.000]   and downloadable free of charge
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.320]   at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.480]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.200]   with author and longtime pastor, John Piper.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.300]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:46.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
