[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Eustitiae nimde, for the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.960]   As it is written, the just shall live by faith.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.840]   Worthy vicar, do we find anything here of relics?
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.920]   By faith man lives and is made righteous, not by what he does for himself,
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.760]   be it adoration of relics, singing of masses, pilgrimages to Rome,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.520]   purchase of pardon for his sins, but by faith in what God has done for him already through his son.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.840]   Dr. Martin, if you leave the Christian to live only by faith, if you sweep away all good works,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.640]   all these glorious things you dismiss as mere crutches, what will you put in their place?
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.040]   Christ. Man only needs Jesus Christ.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.680]   That is a classic clip from the movie Martin Luther, the 1953 version starring
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.760]   Niall McGuinness as Luther, here discussing Romans 117, the famous Reformation text.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.960]   And Pastor John, as you know, Reformation Day is Monday, the 499th anniversary of Luther
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.920]   writing out his 95 theses, sending them to the archbishop.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.800]   So let's tackle two questions on what divides Rome and Geneva, or Rome and Wittenberg.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.720]   The first one for today comes from Dan.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.280]   Dear Pastor John, several of my evangelical friends have converted to Roman Catholicism
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.640]   in recent years. One key issue is over whether the Bible is our sole rule of faith.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.520]   After reviewing some of the Catholic arguments, I have come to appreciate their persuasive force.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.480]   As I've engaged Protestants, however, I've not yet found an equally persuasive defense
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.280]   of the Reformation doctrine of sola scriptura.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.240]   Pastor John, I was wondering if you could please persuade me.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.200]   Well, I don't know if I can persuade you.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:43.920]   There are good books, and so maybe we'll make some of those known in the podcast.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.240]   But here's what I want to say.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.360]   Here's what carries me, and if it helps, it helps.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.080]   I have three kinds of response, three responses, all of which, Dan, will, I hope,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.960]   help you resist the temptation to move toward the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.320]   Here's my first response.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.080]   If the Bible is God's word, by definition, no human authority or human institution
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.040]   can serve alongside the Bible with equal authority.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.440]   Neither the Pope nor any human council or any scholar or priest or pastor or human tradition
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.960]   has the authority of the Bible, if it is God's word, and it is.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:42.800]   Not only that, but the Bible itself nowhere grants to any person or ecclesiastical office
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.680]   an authority equal to its own.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.320]   There are pastors and teachers which Christ gives to the church, according to Ephesians 4.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:01.280]   Their job is not to impart revelation, but to stand on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.520]   And Paul makes plain in 1 Corinthians 14.38 that the authority of those in the church
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.600]   must always give an account to the scriptures, not themselves.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.720]   That's the first response.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.640]   Second response is that it is neither biblical nor wise—that's kind of a paraphrase of
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.520]   Martin Luther's famous statement—it is biblical nor wise to surrender one's conscience
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.080]   to any human authority outside the Bible.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:45.120]   Indeed, it is impossible—try to get me here now—it is impossible to have biblical
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.920]   faith in a truth one does not believe is in the Bible.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:59.920]   It is not the nature of biblical faith, or biblical submission, or biblical
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:08.720]   allegiance to God and his word, that it would bow to any man who teaches anything contrary
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.720]   to the scriptures, which means that the final locus of authority is in the scriptures, and
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.640]   the final court of appeal to what the scriptures teach is in the Spirit-illumined conscience,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.640]   not in a second authority outside the Bible and outside the conscience.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:36.000]   I say that this conviction is rooted in the very nature of biblical faith and the nature
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.200]   of biblical submission.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.960]   Here's what I mean.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:49.360]   To say that another human authority outside the Bible could bind the human conscience
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:58.800]   against what it sees in scripture is to demand that faith and submission not be an act of
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.400]   understanding but only an act of blind submission to external authority.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:15.200]   It is in the very nature of faith that a person cannot believe as biblical something contrary
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.400]   to what he sees in the Bible just because another person tells him it's so.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.880]   You can't.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.000]   It's the nature of faith.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.840]   You can't believe what you don't see is biblical, no matter who tells you to.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.480]   If I see one thing in the Bible but submit to an authority that teaches something different,
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:44.960]   I am de facto elevating that authority above the Bible, and I am attempting the impossible
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.080]   to believe as biblical what I see to be unbiblical.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.040]   That's my second response.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.160]   And the third response is this.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.560]   I've always been amazed that people don't seem to function this way.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:10.560]   Namely, deciding what church to belong to, don't at that moment just take the issue of
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.080]   authority into account and leave all the other doctrines aside.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:23.280]   It seems to me that an evangelical who has shaped his convictions around biblical truth
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.600]   would have to simply close his eyes to be led in the dark in order to embrace the Roman
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:38.480]   Catholic doctrines of baptismal regeneration with its undermining of the biblical necessity
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.440]   of saving faith as a sign of the new birth, and the doctrine of justification on the basis
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.720]   of what God works in me, not on the basis of Christ alone through faith alone, and the
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:59.120]   doctrine of transubstantiation at the Mass and the transfer of grace through those physical
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:06.000]   instruments and practices, and the doctrine of indulgences as strategies of penance and
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.480]   forgiveness which the present Pope has brought forward again and made explicit.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.360]   We thought that was all gone, and it's not all gone.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:24.640]   And the veneration of Mary, which I just saw appallingly in my days in Italy a few weeks
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:33.760]   ago, and the prayers to her elevating her in effect to a co-redeemer with the accompanying
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.160]   diminishing of the centrality of Christ in the piety of millions of people.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:46.160]   So in other words, when you ponder the issue of authority, that is the issue of scripture
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.840]   alone versus the ecclesiastical authority of the Roman church, are you willing to isolate
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.880]   that issue?
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:00.480]   Does not the entire sacramental system almost at every point contradict what you have seen
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.560]   in scripture as an evangelical?
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:12.240]   And if so, are you willing to sacrifice your conscience and say, "I do not see what I
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:12.740]   see"?
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.800]   And that leads us to the weekend and then to Monday, Reformation Day, the 499th anniversary
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.360]   of Luther.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.760]   And I want to know, Pastor John, when you celebrate the Protestant Reformation, what
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.240]   are you celebrating in particular?
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.080]   There's so many answers to that question, but we want to hear from you on Monday.
