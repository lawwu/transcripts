[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360]   I'll tell you though that is relevant to the deep dive I want to do
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.220]   So we're talking about me doing less as a writer
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.680]   so the deep dive I wanted to do today was on the topic of the surprising math of
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.560]   doing less
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.520]   Because when you hear something like I was just talking about
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.860]   My dream schedule as a writer the thing that probably hits
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.220]   The attention of the listener first is like well that doesn't seem like you're doing that much stuff
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.220]   That doesn't seem like it's that much work
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.160]   My argument and this is something I've been thinking through especially as I've been
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.040]   developing my thoughts around my philosophy of slow productivity is
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.560]   that
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.560]   We do too much and we do too much for no good reason
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.080]   Because if we are careful in thinking about the mathematics of value production
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.480]   Doing less is often the optimal strategy
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.000]   That's what I want to argue that doing less can be the optimal strategy now
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.880]   We need some context like what type of thing do we talk about what type of work are we talking about so to be clear?
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.920]   I'm talking about here. Let's say you're in a job where you create things of
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.040]   Value that is what you do for your job
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.120]   So I don't know if it's computer code or if it's articles or consulting reports or artwork
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.800]   Whatever, but if you're in a job where ultimately
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.080]   You create something that did not exist before
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.080]   Be it digital be it physical and that thing has value that wasn't there before so you're constructing value by creating things
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.840]   Which is a lot of people and a lot of people who listen to this podcast if you're in that context. I want to argue a
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.960]   scheduling approach that
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.240]   Reduces the amount of things on your plate will actually increase
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.200]   The total amount of value you produce over time
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.600]   If anything we can actually trace a curve we can try to capture these dynamics with a curve what I think about is what I sometimes
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.880]   Call the productivity versus load curve, but imagine for a second that we have some sort of plot
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.440]   Around the x-axis along the bottom we have the amount of things on your plate
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.040]   obligations projects etc tasks and
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.200]   Imagine on the y-axis the vertical axis we have
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.160]   total value you are producing
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.520]   I argue what you're gonna see is pretty soon that curve is going to peak up and reach a maximum
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.000]   Pretty far to the left pretty far to the not that many things to do and as you keep
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.400]   Moving towards the right towards more and more things on your plate that curve is going to come back down
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.720]   And then it'll be a plateau for a while
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.240]   And then it'll once you get to enough stuff on your plate. It'll actually plummet down to almost no value produced
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   This is the productivity versus load curve
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   It is not like a lot of people suspect something that just keeps going up do more things you you're finishing more things each thing brings
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.480]   Value more things completed means more value you produce more and more values do more things
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   I'm saying no no you actually reach your peak of value production potential pretty early in the potential scale of how many things you're actually doing
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.680]   Now why would that be the case well I'm going to give two categories of explanation
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.120]   The one category I'm going to call negative reasons and the other I'm going to call positive reasons
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.520]   So the the negative reasons why
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.680]   Continuing to add more to your plate actually reduces your total value production has to do with some things
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.880]   We've already talked about on this show negative things that happen
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.880]   Negative things that happen when you add more and more work on your plate and the two big ones we've talked about before I
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.040]   Talked about this in our core idea video about slow productivity. I talked about this on my appearance on the Tim Ferriss podcast
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   the two things that really get
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.680]   bad as you get more and more stuff on your plate is the
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.120]   anxiety of overload and
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.080]   the overhead of
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.800]   overload
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.980]   So we've talked about this before the anxiety piece is that we as human beings have this really neat
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.680]   Center in our brain as far as we know it is unique to humans
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.220]   We've looked at our close primate relatives that have not found it at least in the same configuration
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.560]   But we have this portion in our brain that is good at making long-term plans for the accomplishment of important goals
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.920]   This separates us from a lot of other animals. How does our brain get us to do things?
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.760]   well, it makes us feel good when we construct a plan and
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.080]   Execute that plan and accomplish the goal and it makes us feel bad
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.520]   If we don't if we don't have a plan or we veer away from our plan
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.000]   And that's what just steers us evolutionarily speaking towards actually making plans towards long-term goals
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.560]   the problem is this center of our brain cannot deal with
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.280]   600 unread messages and
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.820]   75 different open obligations on your task list
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.280]   When it sees 15 columns on your Trello board and each of them is getting longer and longer
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.840]   You short-circuit that portion of your brains ability to conceive
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.680]   Making a plan and executing all these different tasks and when you short-circuit that part of your brain
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.760]   You flood those negative chemicals. You feel anxious you feel uneasy. You're feeling that reaction. It's like we're not
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.760]   Sticking with our plans because that brain cannot create plans for that much work. It's a very artificial
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   It's very unnatural to have a ton of stuff on your plate. It's hard to produce good work in that state
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.300]   The second issue I mentioned is overhead
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.360]   This is very pragmatic
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.480]   Every obligation on your plate will bring with it a fixed amount of overhead
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.920]   Emails with people checking in on how it's going
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.200]   Meetings or zoom calls for status updates everything on your plate at least everything beyond the trivial size
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.160]   Brings with it a fixed amount of overhead
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.480]   There's nothing wrong with that overhead when you're looking at a particular thing. You're trying to accomplish. It's good
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.560]   That you can quickly check in with people on email about how it's going
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.520]   It's good to meet with people on a regular basis to check in but as you increase the number of things on your plate
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.560]   the amount of overhead being brought by each thing is the same and it adds and it compounds and
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.600]   now
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.480]   most of your time
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.040]   Ends up with this unavoidable fixed overhead
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.500]   I have to answer the emails about the 20 different things going on each of these 20 different things has its own zoom meeting and it
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.120]   Toxically or some might say cruelly squeezes away the time required to actually do the work
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.360]   So just a pragmatic limitation the more things you have the more this overhead which is useful
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.960]   But does not directly produce value dominates your schedule. So the amount of literal time left to convert in the value is greatly reduced
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.840]   So those two factors are negative
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.920]   Negative impacts on your ability to produce value there are also
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.720]   Positive impacts. So we said here's the negative of doing too much. There's positive impacts on doing
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.120]   less I
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.120]   think this is something that
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.560]   We intuit but we don't often
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.280]   capture precisely
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.260]   Which is if you're looking at a particular pursuit project or activity
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.720]   The value of what you produce is going to grow
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   Non-linearly with the time you put into it
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   So, for example
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.880]   Doubling the time you put into a particular creative project
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.960]   Doesn't necessarily just double the value produce it might
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.320]   significantly more increase that value because it turns out there's these
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.680]   Discontinuous jumps in the value of what you're doing as you cross certain thresholds
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.360]   There's a discontinuous jump as you move for example past the amateur threshold in almost any creative pursuit
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.240]   Once what you're producing is no longer just I kind of did something
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.320]   I kind of just sort of just an amateur effort and actually has a professional polish which takes more time
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.000]   It significantly jumps up in its potential value to the marketplace
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.280]   There's another discontinuous jump that happens when you push something to the level that it becomes remarkable
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:10.480]   Which I mean in the literal sense that now you've added something that's so novel innovative or well done that it actually leads people to
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.120]   remark
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:19.520]   Look at that. That's interesting. It catches people's attention something with that attribute jumps up to another level in value and
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.200]   All of that requires time
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.320]   So the more time you put into things you jump past the amateur level then you jump past to the remarkable level and you get this
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:35.200]   Significant profound increase in the value of what you are producing and these effects can also be seen through a market analogy
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:41.600]   Essentially the more time you put on something the more aggressively you you essentially pare away
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:48.280]   The other people who could produce the same level of quality of what you just produce and as that market gets smaller and smaller your value
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.280]   Jumps up much higher as well
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.040]   But what this all comes down to is that if you have less things on your plate
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.240]   You can spend more times on the things that remain
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:04.440]   Spending more times on the thing that remain will generate much more value than if you instead spread that same time over many more things
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.320]   So this is mathematical if value increases nonlinearly
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:16.360]   With time spent your best strategy is to put as much time as possible on the fewest number of things. That's just pure mathematics
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   So let's again, let's make this real concrete
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.960]   If you're writing something
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.060]   Spending almost all your time working on making that thing you're writing really well
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.400]   So, I don't know you have 20 hours to spend the week spending all 20 hours on that
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.960]   Is in the end probably gonna produce way more value
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:41.260]   Than if you instead spend five hours on that five hours on something else five hours on something else and then five individual hours on five
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.040]   small things
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.200]   You can't just take the value of these smaller
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.480]   investments and add them up and get the same as what you would get if you put all that time into the one thing because
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.320]   When you put all your time to the one thing you leap past the levels you were before
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.600]   So we got negative and positive
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.640]   Reasons that tell us less is better you do too much all these negative things happen to drag you down
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.360]   You do less all these positive impacts happen that push up even more the value you produce
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.620]   So I think this is the situation we're in right now in our in our current world
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:18.220]   Especially in the American economic scene where we have this very large knowledge sector
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:23.720]   That emphasizes skilled employees with great autonomy to individually produce
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:29.120]   Value there's so many people who now fall within that type of economic context and in that situation
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.120]   almost certainly doing less is better and no one does and
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.120]   All of the pressure is towards can't you just do a little more?
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.740]   Can't you answer one more email? Can't you be on one more zoom call?
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:45.160]   It is chaos. It is the Wild West when it comes to how we handle work today and because of that
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.840]   We're leaving a lot of value on the table
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.480]   And I I'm gonna leave it there
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.160]   But it is the point I want to make is that that we can move beyond simply arguing
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.220]   Doing less is good for the human soul doing more is just the rapacious
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.920]   Objective of marauding capitalists that might be true
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.100]   But we have this other piece of ammo to use as well, which is actually doing less also produces more value
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.680]   So it not just makes us happier not just makes work more sustainable
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:20.520]   But it actually increases the value we are able to produce which makes us again happier. It's all a good cycle
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.920]   So I'm a huge believer in less that's at one of the the three main tenets of my slow productivity
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.640]   Philosophy which has three pieces do fewer things working at a natural pace obsessing over quality
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.180]   This is at the beginning of that philosophy do fewer things. That's a big reason why I believe
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.840]   That's true
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:44.620]   Jesse this is all just secretly me trying to speak to like my
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.720]   academic
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.680]   My academic peers like the people who are above me giving me things to do is like just let me do less
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.120]   It's all just a cry all just a cry for help
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.240]   Like we're trying worse. We're on a tight schedule today because I have to be on zoom
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.800]   Can't be maximizing the value in the world
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.080]   Do the people above you work on multiple things? Are they?
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.000]   It's crazy if you're in an academic administrative position
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.760]   Every minute of your day is scheduled
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:19.440]   At least have people doing it for you, but it's like being the president. Yeah, it's just okay, you know, here's what's next. Here's what's next
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.440]   And you get a lot of questions like that for managers and stuff who just want to do more deep work
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.160]   But they don't have any time blocks to put it in. Yeah, it's the problem of the entire economy right now
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.000]   I mean, whatever. This is the major split
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.600]   I think I have with a lot of other commentators is that we
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.880]   Underestimate the degree that these problems come from not knowing how to do this work
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.660]   It's we're quick to just we want an antagonist. So we have someone to fight
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:48.960]   So managers are being evil is the instinct there's a lot of evil managers out there
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.000]   But even if we had the nicest possible managers who wanted you to thrive
