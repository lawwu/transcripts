[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   So Rome always wins because even if they lose battles, they go to the Italian allies and
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.160]   half citizens and raise new armies. So how do you beat them? He can never raise that many troops
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.600]   himself. And Hannibal, I think correctly figures out the one way to maybe defeat Rome is to cut
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.640]   them away from their allies. Well, how do you do this? Hannibal's plan is, I'm not going to wait
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.200]   and fight the Romans in Spain or North Africa. I'm going to invade Italy. So I'm going to strike at
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.560]   the heart of this growing Roman empire. And my hope is that if I can win a couple big battles
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.280]   against Rome in Italy, the Italians will want their freedom back and they'll rebel from Rome
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.160]   and maybe even join me because most people who have been conquered want their freedom back.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.640]   So this is a reasonable plan. So Hannibal famously crosses the Alps with elephants,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.280]   dramatic stuff. Nobody expects him to do this. Nobody thinks you can do this. Shows up in
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.360]   Northern Italy. Romans send an army, Hannibal massacres them. He is a military genius. Rome
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.560]   takes a year, raises a second army. We know this story. Sends it against Hannibal. Hannibal wipes
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.840]   him out. Rome gets clever this time. They say, "Okay, Hannibal's different. We're going to take
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.880]   two years, raise two armies and send them both out at the same time against Hannibal."
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.000]   So they do this and this is the Battle of Cannae, which is one of the most famous battles in
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.360]   history. Hannibal is facing this army of 80,000 Romans about. And he comes up with a strategy
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.720]   called double envelopment. I mean, we can go into it later if you want, but it's this famous
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.040]   strategy where he basically sucks the Romans in, surrounds them on all sides. And in one afternoon
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:52.720]   at the Battle of Cannae, Hannibal kills about 60,000 Romans. Now, just to put that in perspective,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:00.320]   that's more Romans hacked to death in one afternoon with swords than Americans died in 20 years in
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.360]   Vietnam. The following is a conversation with Gregory Aldrete, a historian specializing in
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.240]   ancient Rome and military history. This is the Lax Freedom podcast. To support it, please check
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.840]   out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Gregory Aldrete.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.080]   What do you think is the big difference between the ancient world and the modern world?
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.840]   Well, the easy answer, the one you often get is technology. And obviously, there's huge
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.360]   differences in technology between the ancient world and today. But I think some of the more
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.800]   interesting stuff is a little bit more amorphous things, more structural things. So I would say,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.560]   first of all, childhood mortality. In the ancient world, and this is true of Greeks,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.840]   Romans, Egyptians, really anybody up until about the Industrial Revolution,
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.640]   about 30% to 40% of kids died before they hit puberty. So, I mean, put yourself in the place
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.920]   of an average inhabitant of the ancient world. If you were an ancient person, three or four of
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.920]   your kids probably would have died. You would have buried your children. And nowadays, we think of
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.880]   that as an unusual thing. And just psychologically, that's a huge thing. You would have seen multiple
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.560]   of your siblings die. If you're a woman, for example, if you were lucky enough to make it to,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.640]   let's say, age 13, you probably would have to give birth four or five times in order just to keep the
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.840]   population from dying out. So, those kind of grim mortality statistics, I think, are a huge
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.880]   difference psychologically between the ancient world and the modern.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.120]   But fundamentally, do you think human nature changed much? Do you think this is the same
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.560]   elements of what we see today, fear, greed, love, hope, optimism, and the cynicism,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.760]   the underlying forces that result in war, all of that permeates human history?
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.600]   >> Crude answer, yes. I think human nature is roughly constant. And for me, as an ancient
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.680]   historian, the kind of documents that I really like dealing with are not the traditional literary
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.960]   sources, but they're the things that give us those little glimpses into everyday life. So,
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.680]   stuff like tombstones or graffiti or just something that survives on a scrap of parchment that
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.760]   records a financial transaction. And whenever I read some of those, I'll have this moment of
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.320]   feeling, "Oh, I know exactly how that person felt." Here across 2,000 years of time,
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.760]   completely different cultures, I have this spark of sympathy with someone from antiquity.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.360]   And I think as a historian, the way you begin to understand an alien, a foreign culture,
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.440]   which is what these cultures are, is to look for those little moments of sympathy.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.960]   But on the other hand, there's ways in which ancient cultures are wildly different from us.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.120]   So, you also look for those moments where you just think, "How the hell could these
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.320]   people have done that? I just don't understand how they could have thought or acted in this way."
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.560]   And it's lining up those moments of sympathy and kind of disconnection that I think is when you
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.560]   begin to start to understand a foreign culture or an ancient culture.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.160]   >> I love the idea of assembling the big picture from the details and the little
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.240]   pieces because that is the thing that makes up life. The big picture is nothing without the
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   details. >> Yep, yep. And those details
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.680]   would bring it to life. I mean, it's not the grand sweep of things. It's seeing those little
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.520]   hopes and fears. Another thing that I think is a huge difference between the modern world and the
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.320]   ancient is just basically everybody's a farmer. Everybody's a small family farmer. And we forget
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.760]   this. I was just writing a lecture for my next Great Courses course, and I was writing about
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.760]   farming in the ancient world. And I was really thinking if we were to write a realistic textbook
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.120]   of, let's say, the Roman Empire, nine out of 10 chapters should be details of what it was like to
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.280]   be a small-time family farmer because that's what 90% of the people in the ancient world did.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.120]   They weren't soldiers. They weren't priests. They weren't kings. They weren't authors. They
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.040]   weren't artists. They were small-town family farmers. And they lived in a little village.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.760]   They never traveled 20 miles from that village. They were born there. They married somebody from
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.000]   there. They raised kids. They mucked around in the dirt for a couple decades, and they died.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.800]   They never saw a battle. They never saw a work of art. They never saw a philosopher.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.680]   They never took part in any of the things we define as being history. So that's what life
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.520]   should be, and that's representative. Nevertheless, it is the emperors and the
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.120]   philosophers and the artists and the warriors who carve history.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.080]   And it is the important stuff. So, I mean, that's true. There's a reason we focus on that.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.560]   That's a good reminder, though, if we want to truly empathize and understand what life was like,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.760]   we have to represent it fully. And I would say let's not forget them. So let's not forget what
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.560]   life was like for 80, 90% of the people in the ancient world, the ones we don't talk about,
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:11.600]   because that's important too. So the Roman Empire is widely considered to be the most powerful,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.520]   influential, and impactful empire in human history. What are some reasons for that?
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:26.480]   Yeah. I mean, Rome has been hugely influential, I think, just because of the image. I mean,
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.280]   there's all these practical ways. I mean, the words I'm using to speak with you today,
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.280]   30% are direct from Latin, another 30% are from Latin descended languages.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:42.320]   Our law codes, I mean, our habits, our holidays, everything comes fairly directly from the ancient
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.240]   world. But the image of Rome, at least again in Western civilization, has really been the dominant
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:55.440]   image of a successful empire. And I think that's what gives it a lot of its fascination, this idea
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.640]   that, oh, it was this great, powerful, culturally influential empire. And there's a lot of other
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.920]   empires. I mean, we could talk about ancient China, which arguably was just as big as Rome,
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.120]   just as culturally sophisticated, lasted about the same amount of time. But at least in Western
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.720]   civilization, Rome is the paradigm. But Rome is a little schizophrenic in that it's both
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.200]   the empire when it was ruled by emperors, which is one kind of model, and it's the Roman Republic
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.640]   when it was a pseudo-democracy, which is a different model. And it's interesting how some
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:35.520]   later civilizations tend to either focus on one or the other of those. So the United States,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.720]   revolutionary France, they were very obsessed with the Roman Republic as a model. But other people,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.000]   Mussolini, Hitler, Napoleon, they were very obsessed with the empire, Victorian Britain
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.640]   as a model. So Rome itself has different aspects. Well, what I think is actually another big
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.600]   difference between the modern world and the ancient is our relationship with the past.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:05.040]   So one of the keys to understanding all of Roman history is to understand that this was a people
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:12.960]   who were obsessed with the past and for whom the past had power, not just as something inspirational,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.640]   but it actually dictated what you would do in your daily life. And today, especially in the
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.480]   United States, we don't have much of a relationship with the past. We see ourselves as free agents,
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.320]   just floating along, not tethered to what came before. And the classical story that I sometimes
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:37.040]   tell in my classes to illustrate this is Rome started out as a monarchy. They had kings,
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.040]   they were kind of unhappy with their kings. Around 500 BC, they held a revolution and they kicked
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.360]   out the kings. And one of the guys who played a key role in this was a man named Lucius Junius
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:57.440]   Brutus. 500 years later, 500 years down the road, a guy comes along, Julius Caesar, who starts to
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:03.600]   act like a king. So if you have trouble with kings in Roman society, who are you going to call?
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   Somebody named Brutus. Now, as it happens, there is a guy named Brutus in Roman society at this
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:15.920]   time who was one of Julius Caesar's best friends, Marcus Junius Brutus. Now, before I go further
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:21.200]   with the story, and I think you probably know where it ends, I should talk about how important
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.480]   your ancestors are in Roman culture. I mean, if you went to an aristocratic Roman's house and
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.200]   opened the front door and walked in, the first thing you would see would be a big wooden cabinet.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:39.120]   And if you open that up, what you would see would be row after row of wax death masks. So when a
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.600]   Roman aristocrat died, they literally put hot wax on his face and made an impression of his face at
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.640]   that moment. And they hung these in a big cabinet right inside the front door. So every time you
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:54.720]   entered your house, you were literally staring at the faces of your ancestors. And every child in
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:01.280]   that family would have obsessively memorized every accomplishment of every one of those ancestors.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.760]   He would have known their career, what offices they held, what battles they fought in, what they
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.440]   did. When somebody new in the family died, there would be a big funeral and they would talk about
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.800]   all the things their ancestors had did. The kids in the family would literally take out those masks,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.640]   tie them onto their own faces and wear them in the funeral procession.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.600]   So you were like wearing the face of your ancestors. So you as an individual weren't
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.440]   important. You were just the latest iteration of that family. And there was enormous weight,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.720]   huge weight to live up to the deeds of your ancestors. So the Romans were absolutely
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.360]   obsessed with the past, especially with your own family. Every Roman kid who was, let's say,
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.160]   in a wrist crack family could tell you every one of his ancestors back centuries. I can't go beyond
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.720]   my grandparents. I don't even know, but that's maybe 100 years. So it's a completely different
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.120]   attitude towards the past. And the level of celebration that we have now of the ancestors,
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.080]   even the ones we can name is not as intense as it was in Roman times. No, I mean, it was obsessive
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.520]   and oppressive. It determined what you did. Oppressive, oh.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   Yes, because there's that weight for you to act like your ancestors did.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.120]   Do you think, not to speak sort of philosophically, but do you think it was
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:19.360]   limiting to the way the society develops to be deeply constrained by the... limiting in a good
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.880]   way or a bad way, you think? Well, like everything, it's a little of both,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.960]   but the bad. So on the one hand, it gives them enormous strength and it gives them this enormous
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   connection. It gives them guidance. But the negatives, what's interesting is it makes the
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.040]   Romans extremely traditional minded and extremely conservative. And I mean, conservative in the
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.800]   sense of resistant to change. So in the late Republic, which we'll probably talk about later,
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.640]   Rome desperately needed to change certain things, but it was a society that did things the way the
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.280]   ancestors did it, and they didn't make some obvious changes which might've saved their
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.000]   Republic. So that's the downside, is that it locks you into something and you can't change.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.880]   But to get us back to the Brutuses, so 500 years after that first Brutus got rid of kings,
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.200]   Julius Caesar starts to act like a king. One of his best friends is Marcus Junius Brutus.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.000]   And literally in the middle of the night, people go to Brutus's house and write graffiti on it
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.120]   that says, "Remember your ancestor." And another one is, I think, "You're no real Brutus."
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:27.360]   And at that point, he really has no choice. He forms a conspiracy and on the Ides of March,
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.400]   44 BC, he and 23 other senators take daggers, stick them in Julius Caesar,
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.720]   and kill him for acting like a king. So the way I always pose this to my students is,
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:44.000]   how many of you would stick a knife in your best friend because of what your great, great,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.520]   great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:54.640]   did? That's commitment. That's the power of the past. That's a society where the past isn't just
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:01.120]   influential, but it dictates what you do. And that concept, I think, is very alien to us today.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.240]   We can't imagine murdering our best friend because of what some incredibly distant ancestor did 500
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:13.520]   years ago. But to Brutus, there is no choice. You have to do that. And a lot of societies have this
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:20.240]   power of the past. Today, not so much, but some still do. About a decade ago, I was in Serbia,
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.640]   and I was talking to some of the people there about the breakup of Yugoslavia and some of the
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.560]   wars that had taken place where people turned against their neighbors, basically murdered
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.360]   people they had lived next to for decades. And when I was talking to them, some of them actually
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.600]   brought up things like, "Oh, well, it was justified because in this battle in 12 whatever, they did
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   this." And I was thinking, "Wow, you're citing something from 800 years ago to justify your
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:52.320]   actions today." That's a modern person who still understands the power of the past or maybe is
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.920]   crippled by it is another way to view it. So this is an interesting point and an
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.000]   interesting perspective to remember about the way the Romans thought, especially in the context of
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.520]   how power is transferred, whether it's hereditary or not, which changes throughout Roman history.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.360]   So it's interesting. It's interesting to remember that, the value of the ancestors.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.760]   Yeah. And just the weight of tradition.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.320]   The weight of tradition.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.680]   For the Romans, the mos maiorum is this Latin term, which means the way the ancestors did it.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:28.080]   And it's their word for tradition. So for them, tradition is what your forefathers and mothers
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.600]   did. And you have to follow that example and you have to live up to that.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.760]   Does that mean that class mobility was difficult? So if your ancestors were farmers,
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.480]   there was a major constraint on remaining a farmer, essentially.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.280]   I mean, the Romans all like to think of themselves as farmers, even filthy rich Romans. It was just
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:51.680]   their national identity is the citizen soldier farmer thing. But it did, among the aristocrats,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:58.000]   the people who kind of ran things, yeah, it was hard to break into that if you didn't have famous
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.240]   ancestors. And it was such a big deal that there was a specific term called a novus homo, a new man
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.920]   for someone who was the first person in their family to get elected to a major office in the
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:15.040]   Roman government, because that was a weird and different and new thing. So you actually
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.080]   designated them by this special term. So yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.280]   So if we may, let us zoom out. It would help me, maybe it'll help the audience to look at
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.000]   the different periods that we've been talking about. So you mentioned the Republic, you
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.440]   mentioned maybe when it took a form of empire and maybe there's the Age of Kings. What are the
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.360]   different periods of this Roman, let's call it what, the big-
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.320]   Roman history.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:44.400]   Roman history. And a lot of people just call that whole period Roman Empire loosely, right? So maybe
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.680]   can you speak to the different periods?
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.720]   Yes, absolutely. So conventionally, Roman history is divided into three chronological periods.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:59.040]   The first of those is from 773 BC to 509 BC, which is called the monarchy. So all the periods get
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.240]   their names from the form of government. So this is the earliest phase of Roman history. It's when
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.320]   Rome is mostly just a fairly undistinguished little collection of mud huts, honestly, just like
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:17.760]   dozens of other cities of little mud huts in Italy. So that early phase about 750 to around 500 BC
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.280]   is the monarchy, they're ruled by kings. Then there's this revolution, they kick out the kings,
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:32.080]   they become a republic. That lasts from 500 BC roughly to about either 31 or 27 BC, depending
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.440]   what date you pick is most important, but about 500 years. And the republic is when they have a
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.960]   republican form of government. Some people idealize this as Rome's greatest period. And the big thing
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.280]   in that period is Rome first expands to conquer all of Italy in the first 250 years of that 500
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.160]   year stretch. And then the second 250 years, they conquer all the Mediterranean basin, roughly.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.320]   So this is this time of enormous, successful Roman conquest and expansion. And then you have
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:06.800]   another switch up and they become ruled by emperors. So back to the idea of one guy in charge,
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.880]   though the Romans try to pretend it's not like a king, it's something else. And anyway, we can get
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.800]   into that, but they're very touchy about kings. So they have emperors, Roman empire, the first
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.640]   emperor is Augustus, starts off as Octavians, which is named Augustus when he becomes emperor.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:29.440]   He kind of sets the model for what happens. And then how long does the Roman empire last? That's
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   one of those great questions. The conventional answer is usually sometime in the fifth century,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.720]   so the 400s AD. So about another 500 years, let's say. It's a nice kind of even division,
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:47.360]   500 years of republic, 500 years of empire, but you can make very good cases for lots of other
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.600]   dates for the end of the Roman empire. I actually think it goes all the way through the end of the
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:58.000]   Byzantine empire in 1453. So another 1500 years, but that's a whole other discussion. But so that's
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.880]   your three phases of Roman history. And in some fundamental way, it still persists today,
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.720]   given how much of its ideas define our modern life, especially in the Western world.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:17.040]   Can you speak to the relationship between ancient Greece and Roman empire, both in the chronological
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.760]   sense and in the influence sense? Well, I mean, ancient Greece comes,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:30.240]   the classical era of Greek civilization is around the 500s BC. That's when you have the great
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.680]   achievements of Athens. It becomes the first sort of true democracy. They defeat the Persian
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:42.400]   invasions. A lot of the famous stuff happens around in the 400s, let's say. So that is
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.200]   contemporaneous with Rome, but the Greek civilization, in a sense, is peaking earlier.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.680]   And one of the things that happens is that Greece ends up being conquered by Rome in that second
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:20:00.480]   half of the Roman Republic between 250 and about 30 BC. And so Greece falls under the control of
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:07.600]   Rome and Rome is very heavily influenced by Greek culture. They themselves see the Greeks as a
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.640]   superior civilization, culturally more sophisticated, great art, great philosophy, all this.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:20.240]   And another thing about the Romans is they're super competitive. So one of the engines that
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:27.600]   drives Romans is this public competitiveness, especially among the upper classes. They care
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.960]   more about their status and standing among their peers than they do about money or even
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.520]   their own life. So there's this intense competition. And when they conquer Greece,
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.560]   Greek culture just becomes one more arena of competition. So Romans will start to learn Greek.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.680]   They'll start to memorize Homer. They'll start to see who can quote more passages of Homer in
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.560]   Greek in their letters to one another because that increases their status. So Rome kind of
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:00.080]   absorbs Greek civilization and then the two get fused together. The other thing I should mention
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.280]   in terms of influences that's really huge on Rome is the Etruscans. And this is one that comes along
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:11.920]   before the Greeks. So the Etruscans were this kind of mysterious culture that flourished in
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:17.920]   northern Italy before the Romans, so way back 800 BC. They were much more powerful than the Romans.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.080]   They were kind of a loose confederation of states. For a while, the Romans even seemed to have been
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.440]   under Etruscan control. The last of the Roman kings was really an Etruscan guy pretty clearly.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:36.560]   But the Etruscans end up giving to Rome or you could say Romans up stealing perhaps a lot of
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:42.720]   elements of Etruscan culture. And many of the things that we today think of as distinctively
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.480]   Roman, that was our cliches of what a Roman is actually aren't truly Roman. They're stuff they
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.600]   stole from the Etruscans. So just a couple of examples, the toga. What do you think of a Roman?
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.680]   It's a guy wearing a toga and the toga is the mark of Roman citizen. Well, that's what Etruscan kings
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.440]   wore probably. Gladiator games, we associate those very intensely with the Romans. Well,
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:09.280]   they probably stole that from the Etruscans. A lot of Roman religion, Jupiter is a thunder god,
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:14.720]   all sorts of divination. The Romans love to chop open animals and look at their livers and predict
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:20.880]   the future. That comes from the Etruscans. Watching the flight of birds to predict the future,
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.400]   that comes from the Etruscans. So there's a lot of central elements of what we think of as Roman
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:32.320]   civilization, which actually are borrowings, let's say, from these older, slightly mysterious
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.600]   Etruscans. I mean, that's a really powerful thing. That's a powerful aspect of a civilization to be
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.760]   able to, we can call it stealing, which is a negative connotation. We can also see it as
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:48.880]   integration, basically. Yes, steal the best stuff from the peoples you conquer or the peoples
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:56.160]   that you interact with. Not every empire does that. There's a lot of
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:03.200]   nations and empires that when they conquer, they annihilate versus integrate. And so it's
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.880]   an interesting thing to be able to culturally, like the form that the competitiveness takes
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:16.480]   is that you want to compete in the realm of ideas and culture versus compete strictly in the realm
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:23.040]   of military conquest. Yeah. And I think you've exactly put your finger on one of the, let's say,
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:30.720]   secrets of Rome's success, which is that they're very good at integrating non-Romans or non-Roman
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:37.040]   ideas and kind of absorbing them. So one of the things that's absolutely crucial early in Roman
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:43.280]   history when they're just one of these tiny little mud hut villages fighting dozens of other mud hut
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:48.080]   villages in Italy, why does Rome emerge as the dominant one? Well, one of the things they do is
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.800]   when they do finally succeed in conquering somebody else, let's say another Italianate
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.440]   people, they do something very unusual because the normal procedure in the ancient world is you
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.640]   conquer some, let's say you conquer another city. You often kill most of the men, enslave the women
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.600]   and children, steal all the stuff, right? The Romans, at least with the Italians,
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.760]   conquer the other city and sometimes they'll do that, but sometimes they'll also then say,
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.280]   "All right, we're going to now leave you alone and we're going to share with you a degree of Roman
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.680]   citizenship." Sometimes they'd make them full citizens, more often they'd make them something
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   we call half citizens, which is kind of what sounds like you get some of the privileges of
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.840]   citizenship, but not all of them. Sometimes they would just make them allies, but they would sort
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:36.160]   of incorporate them into the Roman project. And they wouldn't necessarily ask for money or taxes,
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:42.880]   which is weird too. But instead, the one thing they would always, always demand from the conquered
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:50.400]   cities in Italy is that they provide troops to the Roman army. So the army becomes this mechanism of
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.800]   Romanization, where you pull in foreigners, you make them like you, and then they end up fighting
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   for you. And early on, the secret to Rome's military success is not that they have better
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.960]   generals, it's not that they have better equipment, it's not that they have better strategy or tactics,
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:13.360]   it's that they have limitless manpower, relatively speaking. So they lose a war and they just come
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.080]   back and fight again and they lose again and they come back and they fight again. And eventually,
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.680]   they just wear down their enemies because their key thing of their policy is we incorporate the
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.960]   conquered people. And the great moment that just exemplifies this is pretty late in this process.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.760]   So they've been doing this for 250 years just about, and they've gotten down to the toe of Italy,
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.320]   they're conquering the very last cities down there. And one of the last cities is actually
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.280]   Greek city, it's a Greek colony. It's a wealthy city and so when the Romans show up on the doorstep
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.920]   and are about to attack them, they do what any rich Greek colony or city does, they go out and
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.760]   hire the best mercenaries they can. And they hire this guy who thinks of himself as the new Alexander
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.320]   the Great, a man named Pyrrhus of Epirus. So he's a mercenary, he's actually related to Alexander
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:04.880]   distantly. He has a terrific army, top-notch army, he's got elephants, he's got all the latest
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.840]   military technology. The Romans come and fight a battle against him and Pyrrhus knows what he's
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.360]   doing, he wipes out the Romans. He thinks, "Okay, now we'll have a peace treaty, we'll negotiate
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:21.520]   something, I can go home." But the Romans won't even talk, they go to their Italian allies and
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.160]   half-citizens, they raise a second army, they send it against Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus says, "Okay,
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.600]   these guys are slow learners, fine." He fights them again, wipes them out, thinks, "Now we'll
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.880]   have a peace treaty." But the Romans go back to the allies, raise a third army and send it after
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:44.720]   Pyrrhus. And when he sees that third army coming, he says, "I can't afford to win another battle.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.520]   I win these battles, but each time I lose some of my troops and I can't replace them."
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:56.160]   And the Romans just keep sprouting new armies. So he gives up and goes home. So Rome kind of
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:02.160]   loses every battle, but wins the war. And Pyrrhus, one of his, actually his officers,
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.640]   has a great line as they're kind of going back to Greece. He says, "Fighting the Romans is like
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:13.760]   fighting a hydra. And a hydra is this mythological monster that when you cut off one head, two more
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:20.080]   grow in its place. So you can just never win." That's fascinating. So that's the secret to Rome's
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:26.240]   early success. It's not the military strategy, it's not some technological asymmetry of power,
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:33.280]   it's literally just manpower. Early on. And later, the Romans get very good when we're into
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:40.240]   the empire phase now. So once they have emperors into the AD era of kind of doing the same thing
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:47.840]   by drawing in the best and the brightest and the most ambitious and the most talented
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:54.400]   local leaders of the people they conquer. So when they go someplace, let's say they conquer a tribe
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.000]   of what to them is barbarians, they'll often take the sons of the barbarian chiefs, bring them to
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.920]   Rome and raise them as Romans. And so it's that whole way of kind of turning your enemies into
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:12.800]   your own strength. And the Romans start giving citizenship to areas they conquer. So once they
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.120]   move out of Italy, they aren't as free with the citizenship, but eventually they do. So they make
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:24.000]   lost cities in Spain, they make all citizens in other places. And soon enough, the Roman emperors
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.560]   and the Roman senators are not Italians, they're coming from Spain or North Africa or Germany or
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:37.600]   wherever. So as early as the second century AD of the Roman empire. So the first set of emperors,
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   the first hundred years were all Italians. But right away at the beginning of the second century
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.960]   AD, you have Trajan who's from Spain and the next guy Hadrian's from Spain. And then a century later
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.920]   you have Septimius Severus who's from North Africa. You would later get guys from Syria.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.560]   So I mean, the actual leaders of the Roman empire are coming from the provinces.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:56.800]   That's brilliant.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.920]   And it's that openness to incorporating foreigners, making them work for you,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.560]   making them want to be part of your empire that I think is one of this Rome's strengths.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.720]   Yeah, taking the sons is a brilliant idea and bringing them to Rome
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.240]   because it's a kind of a generational integration.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:21.920]   And the Roman military later in the empire is this giant machine of half a million people
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:27.680]   that takes in foreigners and churns out Romans. So the army is composed of two groups. You have
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.200]   the Roman legionaries who are all citizens, but then you have another group that's just as large,
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:39.920]   about 250,000 of each, 250,000 legionaries, 250,000 of the second group called auxiliaries.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:46.320]   And auxiliaries tend to be newly conquered war-like people that the Romans enlist as
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:53.040]   auxiliaries to fight with them. And they serve side by side with the Roman legions for 25 years.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.520]   And at the end of that time, when they're discharged, what do they get?
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:04.080]   They get Roman citizenship and their kids then tend to become Roman legionaries.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.960]   So again, you're taking the most war-like and potentially dangerous of your enemies,
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.880]   kind of absorbing them, putting through this thing for 25 years where they learn Latin,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:18.480]   they learn Roman customs, they maybe marry someone who's already a Roman or a Latin woman,
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:24.160]   they have kids within the system, their kids become Roman legionaries, and you've thoroughly
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.160]   integrated what could have been your biggest enemies, right? Your greatest threat.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:33.520]   >> That's just brilliant, brilliant process of integration. Is that what explains the
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:40.080]   rapid expansion during the late Republic? >> No. So there it's more the indigenous
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   Italians who are in the army at that point, they haven't really expanded the auxiliaries yet,
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.480]   that's more something that happens in the empire. So yeah, so back it up. So we have that first
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:58.080]   250 years of the Roman Republic. So from about 500 to let's say 250 BC. And in that period,
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.200]   they gradually expand throughout Italy, conquer the other Italian cities who are pretty much
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   like them. So they're people who already speak similar languages or the same language,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.680]   have the same gods, it's easy to integrate them, that's the ones they make the half citizens and
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:18.720]   allies. Then in the second half that period from about 250 to let's say 30 BC, Rome goes outside
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.760]   of Italy. And this is a new world because now they're encountering people who are really
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.600]   fundamentally different. So true others, they do not have the same gods, they don't speak the same
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:35.520]   language, they have fundamentally different systems of economy, everything. And Rome first expands in
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:44.720]   the Western Mediterranean. And there, their big rival is the city state of Carthage, which is
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:52.560]   another city founded almost the same time as Rome that has also been a young vigorously expanding
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:58.960]   aggressive empire. So in the Western Empire at this time, you have two sort of rival groups.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:04.560]   And they're very different because the Romans are these citizen soldier farmers. So the Romans are
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.560]   all these small farmers, that's the basis of their economy. And it's the Romans who serve in the army.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:17.440]   So the person who is a citizen is also really by main profession of farmer, and then in times of
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:25.200]   war, he becomes a soldier. Carthage is an oligarchy of merchants. So it's a very small citizen body,
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.720]   they make their money through maritime trade. So they have ships that go all over the Mediterranean.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:36.240]   They don't have a large army of Carthaginians, instead, they hire mercenaries mostly to fight
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:43.680]   for them. So it's almost these two rival systems. It's different philosophies, different economies,
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:49.440]   everything. Rome is strong on land, Carthage is strong at sea. So there's this dichotomy.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.560]   But they're both looking to expand and they repeatedly come into conflict as they expand.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:00.000]   So Carthage is on the coast of North Africa, Rome's in central Italy, what's right between
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.760]   them, the island of Sicily. So the first big war is fought purely dictated by geography,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:13.280]   who gets Sicily, Rome or Carthage. And Rome wins in the end, they get it. But Carthage is still
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.160]   strong, they're not weakened. So Carthage is now looking to expand, the next place to go is Spain,
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.040]   so they go and take Spain. Rome, meanwhile, is moving along the coast of what today is France,
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.360]   where are they going to meet up? On the border of Spain and France. And there's a city at that
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.920]   point of this, at this point in time called Saguntum, the second big war between Rome and
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.640]   Carthage is over, who gets Saguntum? So I mean, you can just look at a map and see this stuff
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.560]   coming. Sometimes geography is inevitability. And I think in the course of the wars between
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.760]   Rome and Carthage called the Punic Wars, there was this geographic inevitability to them.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:53.920]   Can you speak to the Punic Wars? There's so many levels on which we can talk about this,
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.720]   but why was Rome victorious? Well, the Punic Wars really almost
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.320]   always comes down to the second Punic War. There's three, there's three Punic Wars. The
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:08.800]   first is over Sicily, Rome wins. The second is the big one. And it's the big one because
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.120]   Carthage at this point in time, just by sheer luck, coughs up one of the greatest military
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:21.040]   geniuses in all of history, this guy Hannibal Barca. He was actually the son of the Carthaginian
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:26.880]   general who fought Rome for Sicily, Hamilcar was his father. But Hannibal is this just genius,
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:34.160]   just absolute military genius. He goes to Spain. He's the one who kind of organizes stuff there.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:39.760]   And now he knows the second war with Rome is inevitable. And so the question is, how do you
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.960]   take down Rome? He's smart. He's seen Rome's strength. He knows it's the Italian allies.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.240]   So Rome always wins because even if they lose battles, they go to the Italian allies in
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.760]   half-citizens and raise new armies. So how do you beat them? He can never raise that many troops
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:03.200]   himself. And Hannibal, I think correctly figures out the one way to maybe defeat Rome is to cut
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.240]   them away from their allies. Well, how do you do this? Hannibal's plan is, I'm not going to wait
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.800]   and fight the Romans in Spain or North Africa. I'm going to invade Italy. So I'm going to strike at
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:22.160]   the heart of this growing Roman empire. And my hope is that if I can win a couple big battles
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:28.880]   against Rome in Italy, the Italians will want their freedom back and they'll rebel from Rome
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.760]   and maybe even join me. Because most people who have been conquered want their freedom back.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:40.240]   So this is a reasonable plan. So Hannibal famously crosses the Alps with elephants,
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:44.960]   dramatic stuff. Nobody expects him to do this. Nobody thinks you can do this. Shows up in
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:51.040]   Northern Italy, Romans send an army, Hannibal massacres them. He is a military genius. Rome
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.160]   takes a year, raises a second army. We know this story. Sends it against Hannibal, Hannibal wipes
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.520]   him out. Rome gets clever this time. They say, "Okay, Hannibal's different. We're going to take
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.480]   two years, raise two armies and send them both out at the same time against Hannibal."
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.600]   So they do this and this is the Battle of Cannae, which is one of the most famous battles in
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:18.960]   history. Hannibal is facing this army of 80,000 Romans about. And he comes up with a strategy
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.800]   called double envelopment. I mean, we can go into it later if you want, but it's this famous strategy
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.960]   where he basically sucks the Romans in, surrounds them on all sides. And in one afternoon at the
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:38.400]   Battle of Cannae, Hannibal kills about 60,000 Romans. Now, just to put that in perspective,
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:46.000]   that's more Romans hacked to death in one afternoon with swords than Americans died in 20 years in
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.280]   Vietnam. I mean, the Battle of Gettysburg, which lasted three days and was one of the bloodiest
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.880]   battles of civil war, I think the actual deaths at that were maybe like 15,000. So this is
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.560]   bloodshed of an almost unimaginable scale.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.720]   It's also brutal.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:10.000]   Yes. I mean, it's just mind-boggling to think of that. So now this is Rome's darkest hour. This is
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.560]   why the Second Punic War is important because there's that Nietzsche phrase, "What doesn't
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:21.520]   kill you makes you stronger." This is the closest Rome comes to death in the history of the republic.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:29.200]   Hannibal almost kills Rome, but no, it's not much of a spoiler. Rome's going to survive.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.800]   And from this point on, they're going to be unbeatable. But this is the crisis. This is
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:38.480]   the crucible. This is the furnace that Rome passes through that is the dividing point between when
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.200]   they're one more up-and-coming empire and when they're clearly the dominant power in the
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:49.600]   Mediterranean. So what do they do about Hannibal? Well, they're smart. We're not going to fight
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.400]   Hannibal. We're not going to give Hannibal the chance to kill more Romans. So they adopt a
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:38:00.000]   strategy that they'll follow Hannibal, or they raise a couple more armies, follow Hannibal around.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.720]   But whenever Hannibal turns and tries to attack them, the Romans just back off. "No, thank you.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.880]   We're not going to let you give you a chance." Meanwhile, though, they're not scared of other
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:14.400]   Carthaginians. So they raise a couple more armies and they send these to Spain, for example,
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:20.720]   and start attacking the Carthaginian holdings there. And by luck or necessity, Rome comes up
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:26.400]   with its own brilliant commander at this point, a guy named Scipio. And he wins victories in Spain,
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:32.400]   conquers Spain. Then he crosses into North Africa and starts to conquer that and ends up threatening
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:40.000]   Carthage directly. And poor Hannibal, undefeated in Italy, has now been walking up and down Italy,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.240]   or marching up and down Italy for 12 years looking for another fight, and the Romans won't
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:51.120]   give it to him. They've been attacking all these other areas and chipping away at Carthaginian
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:57.120]   power. So finally, after more than a decade in Italy, Hannibal is called back to defend the
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:02.320]   homeland, defend Carthage from Scipio. The two meet in a big battle. This should be one of the
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:07.840]   great battles of all times, the Battle of Zama, but Hannibal's guys are kind of old by this point.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:14.000]   Scipio has all the advantages. He wins. Carthage is defeated. So that's pretty much the end of
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.960]   Carthage. The city survives, and then 50 years later, the Romans wipe it out, but that's not
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:24.720]   much of a war. But from this moment on, from the Second Punic War, which ends in 201 BC,
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:32.240]   Rome is undisputably the most powerful force, nation in the Mediterranean world.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.960]   And having conquered the West, they're now going to turn to the East, which is the Greek world.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:43.200]   And the Greek world is older. It's richer. It's the rich part, half of the Mediterranean.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:48.640]   It's culturally more sophisticated. It's the world left by Alexander the Great that's ruled by
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:55.200]   the descendants of his generals. And the Greeks kind of view themselves as superior to the Romans.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.960]   I mean, to the Greeks, the Romans are these uncouth, sort of savage barbarians, but they're
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:05.360]   going to get a real shock because the Roman army now has gotten really good to beat Hannibal.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.480]   And when they go East, they're going to just defeat the Greeks relatively easily one after the
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:17.280]   other. And there's a famous historian named Polybius, who is a Greek whose city was captured
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.560]   by the Romans. He later becomes a friend to the Scipio family. He actually teaches some of the
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:29.760]   Scipio children about Greek culture. And he writes a history of Rome. And his motivation for writing
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:36.800]   this is he says at the beginning of this book, he says, "Surely there can be no one so incurious as
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:43.200]   to not want to understand how the Romans could have conquered the entire Greek world in 53 years,
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:49.280]   because that seems unimaginable to him." So he's writing this entire history as a way to try and
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.720]   understand how did the Romans do it. We were these wonderful, superior people, and they came around
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.720]   in 50 years, bang, that's the end of us. So that's his motivation.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:04.960]   >> Could you maybe speak to any interesting details of the military genius of Hannibal
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.320]   or Scipio at that time? What are some interesting aspects of this double envelopment idea?
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:16.880]   >> I mean, Hannibal is good because he understood how to use different troop types and to play to
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:22.560]   their strengths and how to use terrain. So I mean, this is basic military stuff, but he did it really
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:27.840]   well. So one of his victories against the Romans, for example, is when the Romans are marching along
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:33.440]   the edge of a lake and their army is strung out in marching formations. They're not in combat
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.760]   formation, but they're strung out along the edge of this lake. It's misty, there's not good
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:44.400]   visibility, and he ambushes them along this lakeside, so Lake Trissimone. And it's just using
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:49.120]   the terrain, understanding this. Again, Hannibal's very much outnumbered, but he's able to use the
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:58.320]   terrain and to take the enemy by surprise. At Cannae, he's working against the expectations.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.800]   So the traditional thing you do in the ancient world is the two armies would line up on opposite
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.440]   sides of a field. You'd put your best troops in the middle, you'd put your cavalry on the sides,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.840]   you'd put your lightly armed skirmishers beyond those. And then the two sides kind of smack
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:17.600]   together and the good troops fight the good troops and you see who wins. Now, Hannibal is hugely
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.720]   outnumbered by this giant phalanx of heavy infantry, which is what the Romans specialized
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.440]   in. They're very good at sort of heavily armed foot soldiers. So he knows, "I don't want to go
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.240]   up against that. I don't have that many of that troop type. My guys aren't as good as the Romans
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:39.040]   anyway." So he lines up some of his less good troops in the center against the big menacing
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:45.200]   Roman phalanx and he tells them, "Okay, when the Romans come, you're not really trying to win.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.240]   Just hold them up. Just delay them." And even tells them, "You can give ground. So you can
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:56.240]   retreat and sort of let the line form a big kind of C-shaped crescents. Let the Romans sort of
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:01.280]   advance into you, but just hold that line." And meanwhile, he puts his cavalry and his good troops
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.480]   on the side. And so on the sides, those good troops defeat the Romans and then they kind of
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:11.440]   circle in behind the Romans and attack that big menacing Roman phalanx from the rear where it's
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:18.400]   very vulnerable. And so Hannibal catches the Romans in this sort of giant cauldron just with
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:24.000]   people closing in from both sides. And they get pressed together. They can't fight properly. They
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   panic and they're all slaughtered. And that strategy of double envelopment of sort of going
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.840]   around both sides becomes the model for all kinds of military strategies throughout the rest of
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.480]   history. I mean, the Germans use this and their blitzkrieg in World War II, a lot of it was kind
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.760]   of that, go around the sides and envelop the enemy. On the Eastern Front, they had a bunch of
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:51.520]   these sort of cauldron battles where they would go around and try to encircle huge chunks of the
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.880]   Soviet, the Russian army and do the same thing. Supposedly even in the Gulf War, it was part of
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.920]   the US strategy for the invasion of Iraq to do this kind of double envelopment maneuver. So it's
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.840]   something that for the rest of military history has been an inspiration to other armies.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.920]   Can you speak to maybe the difference between heavy infantry and cavalry,
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.160]   the usefulness of it in the ancient world?
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:19.200]   The ancient world sort of from the Greeks through the Romans, there's this consistent line of
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:24.960]   focusing on heavy infantry. So going back to Greece, when they're fighting, let's say Persia,
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:31.280]   which at the time was the superpower of the ancient world and vastly richer, vastly larger
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:37.760]   than ancient Greece, tons more men. But the Persians tended to be archers, tended to be light
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:43.440]   horsemen, tended to be light infantry. Whereas the Greeks specialized in what are called hoplites,
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:50.480]   which is a kind of infantrymen with very heavy body armor, a helmet, a spear and a really big,
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:55.840]   heavy shield. And they would get in that formation where you kind of make the shields overlap and
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:02.160]   just form this solid mass bristling with spear points and just slowly kind of march forward and
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.040]   grind up your enemy in front of you. And so that's that sort of block of heavy infantry.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:13.120]   The advantages head on against other things, they tend to win. The disadvantages, it's slow moving,
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:19.360]   it's vulnerable from the sides and the rear, so you got to protect those. But if you can keep
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:26.560]   frontally faced, it's pretty much invincible. And that's taken even further by Alexander the Great,
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:31.680]   who comes up with the idea, well, what if we even give them a longer spear? So Greek spears
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:37.600]   were six to eight feet long. Alexander the Great arms his armies with the sarissa, which is this
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:42.720]   15 foot, almost a pike, this extra long spear. And so when the spear is that long,
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.680]   you don't even hardly need the shields anymore. So it's just this incredibly powerful thing
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:53.200]   in frontal attack. And that's what he uses to make himself ruler of the known world. He goes
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:59.440]   and conquers the Persian empire and makes himself the Persian king of kings with this phalanx of
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:05.520]   troops armed with the sarissa. So that's very powerful. The Romans go a little bit different
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:11.760]   route. They have heavy infantry, but they focus more on fighting with short swords. So it's get
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:20.000]   up close and kind of stab. And the other thing the Romans do is they focus on flexibility and
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   subdividing their army. So Alexander's phalanx was a mass of, let's say, 5,000 guys, and it was
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.760]   one unit. The Roman army is organized in an ever decreasing number of subunits. So you have a group
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.800]   of eight guys who are a contubernia, the men who share a tent. You take 10 of those and they form
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.200]   a century of 80 men. You take a bunch of those and you form a cohort. You forget a bunch of those,
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:49.040]   you form a legion. So the Romans were able to subdivide their army. And the big sticking point
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:56.000]   comes at 197 BC at the Battle of Cynoscephalae when the Roman legion goes up against one of
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.040]   the descendants of Alexander the Great who's using his military system. So this is the new Roman
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:07.600]   system with flexibility versus the old invincible Alexander system with the heavily armed sarissa
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:12.880]   with those long 15-foot poles. And the key moment in the battle is where they lock together
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:19.360]   and in a head-on clash, the Macedonians are gonna win. But the Romans have the flexibility to break
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.840]   off a little section of their army, run around to the side and attack that formation from the side,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.880]   and they win the battle. So they prove tactically superior because of their flexibility.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.760]   So it's always development and counter-development in military history.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.400]   >> A fascinating, brutal testing ground of tactics and technology.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.840]   >> Adaptation. You have to keep adapting. That's, I think, the key thing.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:49.200]   >> One of the fascinating things about your work, you study Roman life, life in the ancient world,
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:57.760]   but also the details like we mentioned. You are an expert in armor. So what kind of,
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.800]   maybe you could speak to weapons and most importantly armor that were used by the Romans
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:07.040]   or by people in the ancient world. >> I do military history. So I mean,
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:13.280]   the Romans specialized in... I mean, early on, they have pretty random armor and it's not
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.800]   standardized. I mean, remember, there's no factories in the ancient world. So nobody's
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:22.080]   cranking out 10,000 units of exactly the same armor. Each one is handmade. Now, there can be
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.600]   a degree of standardization. Even as early as Alexander, there was a certain amount of
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:31.120]   standardization, but each one is still handmade. And that's important to keep in mind, each weapon,
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:38.400]   each piece of armor. Armor develops over time to fit the tactics. So the Greek hoplites are very
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:44.160]   heavy armor. The Roman infantrymen early in the Republic is lighter. Eventually, they get this
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:50.000]   typical sort of chain mail shirt, helmet shield. The classic sort of Roman legionary, I would say,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.040]   is the one of the first and second centuries AD. So the early Roman Empire. And this is the guy
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:02.160]   who wore bands of steel arranged in sort of bands around their body. So it looks almost like a
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:08.000]   lobster's shell, right? And this is a thing called the lorica segmentata. So it's solid steel, which
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.040]   is very good protection, but it's flexible because it has these individual bands that provide a lot
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:18.480]   of movement. And then you have a helmet, you have a square shield that's kind of curved, and you
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.720]   have the short sword, the Roman gladius. And that's kind of the classic Roman legionary.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:30.000]   Later, more things develop. My personal sort of relationship with armor is I got
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:38.080]   really by accident involved in this project to try to reconstruct this mysterious type of armor that
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:44.160]   was used, especially by the Greeks and Alexander the Great called the linothorax, which apparently
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:49.600]   was made only out of linen and glue. So this seems a little odd that that's not the sort of material
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   once you want metal or something. But we had clear literary references that people, including
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:01.360]   Alexander, and the most famous image of Alexander is this Alexander mosaic found at Pompeii that
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:08.880]   shows him wearing one of these funny types of armor. The catch is none survived. It's organic
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:15.920]   materials. So we don't have any of them. And archeologists like to study things that survive.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:21.440]   So we have nice typologies of Greek armor made of bronze, Roman armor made of steel or sort of
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:28.880]   proto steel. But this thing, this linothorax was a mystery. And one of my undergraduate students,
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:34.560]   a guy named Scott Bartel, had a real, well, an Alexander obsession. He really loved Alexander.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.360]   >> As one should.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:40.480]   >> He had Alexandros tattooed on his arm in Greek. And he was a smart student. He was really smart.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:47.920]   And so he one summer made himself an imitation of this thing of Alexander's just for fun. And he
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:52.880]   said, "Can you give me some articles so I could do a better job, some scholarly articles about
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.200]   this armor?" And with typical sort of academic arrogance, I said, "Why, Scott, of course I will.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.680]   I'll give you some references." And I went and looked and there weren't any. So at that point,
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:09.840]   I was like, "Huh, tell you what, why don't you and I look into this and try to do a reconstruction
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.320]   using only the materials they would have had in the ancient world?" And little did I know at the
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:19.120]   time, I thought maybe I'll get an article out of this. I mean, it ended up being a 10-year project
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:26.720]   involving 150 students, a couple dozen other faculty members, ended having three documentaries
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.920]   made out of it. And Scott and I ended up writing a scholarly book on this. So this is how you never
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   know where your next project's gonna come from. So it started with this undergraduate, turned into
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.480]   this huge thing, but it's what we did. We first said, "All right, what are all the sources for
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:48.080]   this armor?" And in the end, we found 65 accounts of it in ancient literature by 40 different
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.600]   authors. So we have literary descriptions. And then we looked at ancient art and we were able
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:52:02.480]   to identify about a thousand images in ancient art in vase paintings, pottery, bronze sculpture,
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:07.600]   tomb paintings, all these different things showing this armor. And then using those two things,
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:12.160]   we tried to backwards engineer a pattern to say, "Well, if this is what the end product looks like,
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.320]   what does it have to look like when you make it?" And then we tried to reconstruct one of
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:22.560]   these things using only the glue and materials. So we had to use animal glues, rabbit glue.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:29.200]   We had to end up sort of making our own linen, which comes from the flax plant. So we had to
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:34.080]   grow flax, harvest it using only techniques in the ancient world. So modern flax goes through
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.560]   chemical processes. No, we had to do this the old-fashioned way, spin it into thread. So the
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:44.080]   thread into fabric, glue it all together. And then the fun part was once we made these things,
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:50.240]   we subjected them to ballistics testing. So we shot them with arrows, which again were wooden
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.880]   reconstruction arrows using bronze arrowheads that were based on arrowheads found on ancient
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:53:00.400]   battlefields to determine how good protection would this thing have been. And of course,
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:04.240]   the kind of fun one that everyone always likes and that the documentaries always want is at
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.680]   one point they're like, "Well, can you put Scott in one of these and shoot him?" And we're like,
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:13.280]   "Okay." I mean, at that point, we'd done about a thousand test shots. I grew up shooting bows
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.840]   and arrows. I knew exactly how far that was going to go. So it's one of these, "Don't do this at
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:22.560]   home, kids." >> So there's a million questions to ask here, but in general, how well in terms
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:29.040]   of ballistics does it work? Can it withstand arrows or direct strikes from swords and axes
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:35.840]   and stuff like that? >> Bottom line is a one centimeter thick line of thorax. So laminated
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:42.400]   or even sewn, it doesn't have to be laminated, layer of linen is about as good protection as
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:48.640]   two millimeters of bronze, which was the thickest comparable body armor of bronze at the time. And
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:56.320]   we're talking fourth century, fifth century BC here. So classical and Hellenistic Greece.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:01.280]   And that would have protected you from, let's say, random arrow strikes on the battlefield.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.840]   So you could have gotten hit by arrows and they simply wouldn't have gone through.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:09.200]   >> What are the benefits? Is there a major weight difference?
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:15.600]   >> Yes. So the benefits of this are it's much lighter than metal armor. So the line of thorax
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:23.760]   is about 11 pounds. A bronze cuirass of comparable protection would have been about 24 to 6 pounds.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:30.560]   A chain mail shirt would be about 28, 27 pounds. It's cooler. I mean, the Mediterranean is a hot
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:35.680]   place with the hot sun. Even today, a linen shirt is something you wear when you want to be cool.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.520]   So it's much lighter. That gives your troops greater endurance on the battlefield. They
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:45.360]   can run farther, fight longer. It's cheaper. You don't need a blacksmith who's a specialist
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:50.320]   to make it. In fact, probably, this is interesting, any woman in the ancient world could
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:56.800]   have made one of these because they were the ones who spun thread and sewed it into fabric.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:02.800]   So I can easily see in a household, a mother making this for her son, a wife making it for
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:09.280]   her husband. So it's a form of armor you could have made domestically that would have been maybe
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:13.760]   not the greatest armor, but pretty good, pretty comparable to bronze armor.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:17.520]   And it's amazing that you used all the materials they had at the time and none of the modern
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:22.480]   techniques. But I should probably say, maybe you can speak to that, they were probably much better
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:29.520]   at doing that than you are, right? Because again, generational, it's a skill. It's a skill that
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:34.480]   probably is practiced across decades, across centuries. I mean, in terms of producing the
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.200]   fabric, I'm sure they could do it 10 times faster than we could. Just that's a speed thing. But it's
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.760]   still incredibly labor intensive. Where I think there's a big difference between our reconstruction
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:49.280]   and ancient ones is in the glue. So we ended up using a kind of least common denominator glue,
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.680]   we used rabbit glue, because it would have been available anywhere and it's cheap.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:56:00.720]   But in the ancient world, they did have basically the equivalent of super glues. I mean, we found,
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:06.800]   for example, helmets that were fished out of a river in Germany that had metal parts glued
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:11.520]   together that after 2000 years of immersion in water were still glued together. So they had some
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:16.240]   great glues, we just don't know what the recipes for them were. So we went the opposite tack and
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:20.320]   said, "Well, we're just going to make something that we know they could have made." So it was at
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.680]   least this good, you know what I'm saying? But actually, this is a materials thing,
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:35.680]   but I think glue, aside from helping glue things together, it can also be a thing that serves as
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:42.960]   armor. So if you glue things correctly, the way it permeates the material that is gluing can
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.880]   strengthen the material, the integrity of the material. That's an art and a science probably
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.280]   that they understood deeply. >> The process of lamination
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.600]   did add something. So there's actually a huge debate among scholars and actually a sort of
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:59.680]   amateur archaeologist that was this line of thorax thing glued together or was it simply sewn
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:04.800]   together? Was it composite, partially linen, partially leather or other materials? And my
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:09.440]   honest answer is, I think it's all of the above. Because again, every piece of armor in the ancient
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:14.640]   world was an individual creation. So I think if you had some spare leather, you put that in.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.720]   If you wanted to make one that was just sewn together or even quilted, stuffed with stuff,
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:23.520]   you do that. Maybe you were good at gluing stuff, you use that. So I think there's no one answer.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:29.920]   We investigated one possibility because we just had limited time and money and resources,
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:34.160]   but I think all these other things existed at the same time and were variants of it.
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:39.040]   >> Just as a small aside, I just think this is a fascinating journey you went on. I love it.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:49.200]   Sort of answering really important questions about, in this case, armor, about military
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:56.000]   equipment and technology that archaeologists can't answer by using all the sources you can
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.320]   to understand what it looked like, what were the materials, using the materials at the time,
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.240]   and actually doing ballistic testing. It's really cool. It's really cool that
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:11.680]   you see that there's a hole in the literature. Nobody studied it. And going hard and doing it
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:17.920]   the right way to sort of uncover this, I don't know, I think it's an amazing mystery about the
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.000]   ancient world. >> I mean, shifting from just sort of
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.560]   Roman history in general to my research that I've done as a scholar, the theme that runs throughout
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:29.680]   my scholarship is practical stuff. I'm interested, how did this actually work in the ancient world?
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:34.320]   So there's people who are much more theoretical, who look at the symbolic meaning of something.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:40.240]   I'm simpler. I just want to know, how did this work? So almost all of my books that I've written
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.560]   have started with some just, how did something work? And I'm trying to just figure out that
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:49.120]   aspect of it. And that's just, maybe it's a personality thing. I also have kind of a
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.600]   science-y background. So I think I've used a lot of that, even though I'm a humanist
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:59:00.240]   and a historian, I use a lot of kind of hard science in my work. I did a book on floods,
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:05.600]   where I had to get really heavy into vectors of disease and hydraulics and engineering and all
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:10.800]   that stuff. And I think, again, having that sort of hard science combined with a humanist background
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.720]   helps with those sorts of projects. Well, like you said, I think the details help you understand
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.200]   deeply the big picture of history. And I mean, Alexander the Great wore this thing.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:25.920]   Yeah. And I should say, by the way, it does drop out of use around Roman times. And I think what's
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:32.560]   going on there is technology, that with bronze, it's hard to keep a sharp edge on things. But
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:38.320]   once you get into metals, which approximates steel, you can get sharper. And a key factor
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:44.400]   to penetrating fabric is the edge on the arrowhead, right? So as soon as you start to get something
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:48.720]   more like a razor edge, it's going to go through it more easily. Also, there's changes in the
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:54.320]   bows that are being used. You start to get sort of Eastern horse archers showing up with composite
[00:59:54.320 --> 01:00:00.560]   bows, which are much more powerful. And so it just becomes outdated as frontline military equipment.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.800]   What's interesting is by the Roman period, people are still wearing it, but it's now things like,
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.120]   when I go hunting, if I'm hunting lions, I wear this. There's an actual source that says,
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.280]   it's really good for hunting dangerous big cats because it catches their teeth and
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:19.440]   stops them from penetrating. One emperor wears one of these under his toga. It's kind of like a
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:24.880]   bulletproof vest, but stab-proof vest. So again, it's not to fight in the front line of the legions,
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.440]   but it'll protect him from somebody trying to assassinate him. So it still has those uses
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:35.520]   where you're not up against top-line military equipment. To honor the aforementioned undergraduate
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.520]   student who loves Alexander the Great, we must absolutely talk about Alexander the Great for
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.640]   a little bit. Why was he successful, do you think, as a conqueror? Probably one of the
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:51.920]   greatest conquerors in the history of humanity. Yeah. And I mean, is he one of the greatest heroes
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:57.040]   or one of the greatest villains in humanity too? It's like Julius Caesar. He's famous for
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.720]   conquering Gaul. Well, about a million people were killed and a million enslaved in that. So
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.960]   does it make him a horrible person or one of our heroes? But Alexander is a combination of
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.600]   two things. One is he really just was a skilled individual. And he was one of those guys who had
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.960]   it all. He was smart, he was athletic, and he was supremely charismatic. I mean, it's obviously one
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   of these people that would walk into a room and everyone just kind of gravitates to him. He had
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:29.600]   that magic that made him an effective leader. And secondly, he was lucky because it wasn't all him.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:36.000]   He inherited a system created by his father, Philip II. So he was in the right time at the
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.560]   right place and had this instrument placed in his hands. And then he had the intelligence and the
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.840]   charisma to go use it. So it's one of these coming together of different things. But often,
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:52.880]   his father's contribution, I think, is not recognized as much as it is. It's his father
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.680]   who reformed the Macedonian army, who came up with that system of equipping them with the sarissa,
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.440]   this extra long spear that made them really effective, created the mixed army. So one of
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:10.080]   the keys to Alexander's success as a tactical sense is that his army was composed of different
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:15.440]   elements, heavy cavalry, light cavalry, heavy infantry, light infantry, missile troops.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.400]   And he understand that he can use these in different and flexible ways on the battlefield,
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.520]   whereas a lot of warfare before then had just been you line up, two sides smash together.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:30.400]   So he did clever things with this army that was a better tool than others did.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:37.360]   And then he was just supremely ambitious. I mean, he cared about his fame, which I guess is ego,
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:42.560]   but he clearly cared about that more than he did about things like money. He was indifferent to
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:50.320]   that. And he did have a grand vision. So he did have this vision of trying to unite the world,
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:55.040]   both politically under his control, but also culturally. And this is an interesting thing.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:02.160]   So he was very open, in fact, insistent of trying to meld together the best elements
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:08.400]   of all the different cultures. So he himself was a Macedonian, but he admired Greek culture. So he
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.920]   pretty much adopted Greek culture as his own. When he conquers Persia, he starts adapting elements of
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:19.840]   Persian culture. He dresses in Persian clothing. He marries a Persian woman. He sort of forces
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.960]   thousands of his troops to marry local women. He appoints Persians to positions of power. He
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:30.320]   integrates Persian units into his military. He really wanted to fuse all these things together.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:36.960]   And some people see this as a very enlightened vision that, "Oh, he's not just, I want to conquer
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.880]   people, and now they're my slaves," that he was really trying to create this one culture that was
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:45.520]   sort of the best of everything. Others see it, of course, as a form of cultural imperialism. You're
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:52.320]   destroying other cultures and trying to warp or twist them into something. But what I think's
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:04:01.360]   interesting is that this vision he had of uniting cultures creates very problematic tensions among
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:08.480]   his own followers, because the Macedonians, his original troops, did not like this on the whole.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.760]   They wanted the old model where we conquer you, you're our slaves. We don't want to share stuff
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.440]   with you. We don't want you joining us in the army. We don't want you appointed to positions
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.280]   of power. We're your conquerors, and that's it. And so Alexander had to deal with a lot of friction
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:29.920]   from his own oldest, most loyal elements at the way he was being, in their eyes, too generous to
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:36.000]   the conquered. So Alexander is one of these interesting personalities because every generation
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.920]   sees him in a new light and focuses on different things. So for some, he's this enlightened
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:46.160]   visionary who was taught by Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, and they say, "Well, this influenced
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.520]   him." Others see him as an egomaniacal war bonger, just, "I'm out to kill and gain glory."
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.840]   There was a book a couple decades ago that says, "Oh, he's just an alcoholic," which he probably
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:03.520]   was. Yeah. So you get all these competing images. And the great thing is we don't really know what
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:09.920]   the true Alexander was or what his motivations were. It's a mixed message. Why do you think
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:20.160]   the Roman Empire lasted while the Greek Empire, as the Alexander expanded, did not?
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.680]   That's a clear answer. So Alexander's empire fragmented the moment he died.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:32.080]   And so his empire was all about personal loyalty. It was his charisma holding it together,
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:38.800]   his personality. And he completely failed to create a structure so that it would continue
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.560]   after his death. And of course, he died young. He didn't think he would die when he did, but still,
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:48.480]   you should put something in place. So his was a flash in the pan. It was, he had this spectacular
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:54.160]   conquest. In 10 years, he conquered what was then most of the known world, but he had no permanent
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:59.440]   structure in place. He didn't really deal with the issue of succession. It fell apart instantly.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:05.120]   The Romans are much more about building a structure. So, I mean, as we've talked about a
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.240]   little, they were very good about incorporating the people they conquered into the Roman project.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.360]   I mean, they're oppressive. They're imperialistic as well. Let's not whitewash them. I mean,
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:20.800]   they had moments when they would just wipe out entire cities. But on the whole, they were much
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:26.240]   more about trying to bring people into the Roman world. And I think that was one of their strengths
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:33.360]   is that they were open to integration and bringing in different people to keep rejuvenating themselves.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.560]   >> One of the most influential developments from the Roman Republic was their legal system.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:44.000]   And as you mentioned, it's one of the things that still lasted to this day in many of its elements.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:51.360]   So, it started with the 12 tables in 451 BC. Can you just speak to this legal system and the 12
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.400]   tables? >> Yeah. I mean,
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.880]   Roman law is one of their most significant, maybe the most significant legacy they have on the
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:02.400]   modern world. So, I mean, just to start at that end of it, something like 90% of the world uses
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.880]   a legal system which is either directly or indirectly derived from the Roman one. So,
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:11.680]   even countries that you wouldn't think are really using Roman law kind of are because
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:17.440]   all the terminology, all that comes from Roman law. And the Romans, their first law code was
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:24.000]   this thing, the 12 tables. So, this is way back in the Middle Republic. And it was a typical
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:31.680]   early law code. So, most of the stuff it concerns are agricultural concerns. So, if I have a tree
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:37.120]   and its fruit drops onto your property, who owns the fruit? If my cow wanders into your field and
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:42.160]   eats your grain, am I responsible? I mean, I love these early law codes that are all about this
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:49.520]   like farmer problems. But law codes are hugely important because you need a law code to enable
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:55.040]   people to live in groups. So, they're the transitional thing that lets human beings
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.960]   live together without just resorting to anarchy. And most of the early law codes are agricultural
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:07.120]   like Hammurabi's code in Mesopotamia. Most of them are retaliatory, meaning eye for an eye type
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:13.200]   justice. So, you do something to me, it gets done to you. But they're this necessary precondition
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:19.200]   for civilization, I would say. And the 12 tables is that. It's a crude law code. It has a lot of
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:26.320]   goofy stuff in it. It has things about if you use magic, this is the punishment. But it's that basic
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:32.480]   agrarian society law code. Now, that's typical of many societies. Where the Romans are different is
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:38.880]   they keep going. They keep developing their law code. And by the late Republic, the Romans just
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:44.400]   get kind of really into legal stuff. I don't know why. And the Romans are very methodical,
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.040]   organized people. So, maybe this has something to do with it. But their law code just keeps
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.520]   getting more and more complicated and keeps expanding to different areas. And they start
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:00.240]   to get jurists who write sort of theoretical things about Roman law. And eventually, it becomes this
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:09.200]   huge body both of cases and comments on those cases and of actual laws. And in the sixth century AD,
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:16.560]   so the 500s, the Roman Emperor Justinian, who is a emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire by this point,
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:21.040]   the Byzantine Empire, compiles all this together into something that today we just kind of loosely
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:26.960]   call Justinian's Code of Roman Law. And that survives. And so, that becomes the basis for
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:32.080]   almost all the legal systems around the world. And it's very complicated. And Roman law, I think,
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.200]   is really fun. Because on the one hand, it's really dry. But it also preserves these wonderful
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:42.800]   little vignettes of daily life. So, you get these courageous kind of entertaining law cases.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.320]   One of my favorite, and this may not even be a real case, this might be a hypothetical that they
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:52.880]   would use to train Roman law students, is like, one day, a man sends a slave to the barber to get
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:59.120]   a shave. And the barber shop is adjacent to an athletic field. And two guys are on the athletic
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:04.320]   field throwing a ball back and forth. And one of them throws the ball badly. The other guy fails
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.200]   to catch it. The ball flies into the barber shop, hits the hand of the barber, cuts the slave's
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:16.160]   throat. He dies. Who's liable under Roman law? Is it the athlete one who threw the ball badly?
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:21.120]   Is it athlete two who failed to catch it? Is the barber who actually cut the slave's throat?
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:27.360]   Is it the owner of the slave for being stupid enough to send his slave to get a shave in a
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.640]   place adjacent to a playing field? Or is it the Roman state rezoning a barber shop next to an
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.920]   athletic field? What do you think? Well, do they resolve the complexity of that
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.440]   with the right answer? We don't have the answer. We don't have the answer.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:47.280]   It's a case without the answer. So we have various jurists commenting on this one,
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.920]   but we don't have what was actually ruled. But it's just a great little sort of vignette.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.680]   And that's how complicated Roman law got, that it was dealing with these weird esoteric questions.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:04.160]   There's another one where a cow gets loose and runs into an apartment building, goes up onto
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:10.240]   the roof and crashes down three stories into a bar on the ground floor and kicks open the taps to the
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:16.560]   wine jug and all the wine flows out. Who's at fault? I mean, this seems to have happened as
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:22.560]   crazy as it sounds. And Roman testamentary law is great. I mean, something like 20% of Roman law has
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:27.600]   to do with wills and what you do with the will and what makes a will valid. You have to have
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.080]   seven witnesses and you have to have a guy named a Lieberprens to witness it. And the witnesses have
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:37.840]   to be adult men who can't be blind and all this other stuff. So it's just great. I mean, it's fun
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:43.040]   to mess around in this, but it always contains these little nuggets about what happens. I mentioned
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:48.400]   I wrote a book on floods and there were all these law cases about if a flood strikes the city and
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.680]   picks up my piece of furniture in my apartment building and carries it out the door and deposits
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.240]   it in another apartment building, does that guy now own my furniture? Because it's now legally
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.560]   within his apartment. Or can I go in there and repossess it because the flood took it out of my
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:07.680]   apartment? This is the stuff laws handle and that's how sophisticated Roman law got.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.520]   >> Did kind of corrupt, unfair things seep into the law?
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.160]   >> Oh, yeah. I mean, it's biased in favor of the wealthy, obviously. And I mean,
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:25.360]   Roman law cases are interesting because they became linked to politics. So one of the way
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.680]   that politicians, up and coming politicians, aspiring politicians could sort of make their
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:35.760]   name or become famous was by either prosecuting or defending people in Roman law courts.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:42.240]   And especially during the late Roman Republic, you get a lot of really sensational, what today
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.760]   we'd call celebrity law cases. So this is where some of the biggest politicians were accused of
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:54.720]   very melodramatic kinds of things. And I mean, the most famous Roman order of all time, Cicero,
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.800]   is a guy who made his entire career in the law courts. And that's how he made his reputation,
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:05.600]   was able to parlay that into political power, and eventually was elected to the highest office in
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.560]   the Roman government. But it's purely because of his skill, his facility at using words,
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:16.000]   at giving speeches in public. >> So they loved the puzzle and the game of
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.160]   law, the sort of untangling really complicated legal situations and coming up with new laws
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:30.160]   that help you tangle and untangle the situations. >> Yes, and law cases, again, especially in the
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:36.480]   late Republic, also became a form of public spectacle. So Rome did not have law courts
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.320]   in a building locked away. A lot of these cases were held in the Roman forum in the open,
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:48.000]   and audiences would just come to be entertained. And the people presenting the speeches there were
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.120]   playing as much to this audience as they were to, let's say, the jury or a judge.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.200]   And that became a big part of the cases. So that's all tied up in Roman oratory too.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:03.200]   >> So we're talking a bit about the details of the laws. Is there some big picture laws
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:10.080]   that are new innovations or profound things like all Roman citizens are equal before the law,
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:16.160]   kind of founding fathers type of in the United States, in the Western world, these big legal
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:21.760]   ideas? >> I think maybe one of the things that was really stressed in Roman law early on, even as
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:27.840]   early as the 12 Tables, is the notion of Roman citizenship. So if you were a Roman citizen,
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:34.080]   it came with a set of both privileges and obligations. So the obligations were you're
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:38.880]   supposed to fight in the army, you were supposed to vote in elections. The privileges were you had
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.320]   the protection of Roman law, and at least in theory, if not in practice, everybody was equal
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.800]   under that law. Now, of course, keep in mind we're talking about men here. And even at the height of
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:57.120]   the Roman Empire, so let's say 2nd century AD, there were about 50 million human beings living
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:06.000]   within the boundaries of the Roman Empire. Maybe 6 million were actual citizens. So we tend to go,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.200]   "Oh, it's so great. If you're a citizen, you have all these things." Well, adult free men who are
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:17.120]   not slaves, who are not resident foreigners, they have this great stuff. And that's always a tiny
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:25.120]   minority of all the human beings who existed in this society. But still, the notion of citizenship
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:31.200]   is huge. And citizens, for example, early on, you had to be tried at Rome if you were accused of
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:38.480]   something. And there's this very famous moment in Sicily where an abusive governor who's corrupt
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:46.560]   is punishing a citizen arbitrarily. And this person cries out, "Cuius Romanus sum," meaning,
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:53.280]   "I am a Roman citizen." And it really was this hugely loaded statement that that gives me
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:58.880]   protections. It is wrong for you to do this to me. It's wrong for you to beat me because I am a
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:04.240]   citizen, and that gives me certain protections. So that notion of citizenship is something that I
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:10.160]   think the Romans really emphasize and becomes a legacy to a lot of civilizations today,
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.280]   where citizenship means something. It's a special status.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:20.240]   So you mentioned slaves. Slavery, that's something that is common throughout human history.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:25.200]   What do we know about their relationship with slavery?
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:30.080]   Well, Roman slavery, a couple just reminders at the beginning. First of all, it's not racial
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.720]   slavery. So for people in the United States, you tend to think of slavery through this kind
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:42.640]   of racial lens. So slaves in ancient Roman society could be any color, ethnicity, gender, origin,
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:50.640]   whatever. It's an economic status. Now, having said that, slavery is fundamentally horrific to
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:57.680]   human dignity because it is defining a human being as an object. And very famously, a Roman
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:02.560]   agricultural writer who's writing about farms, just as a kind of aside says, "You know, on your
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:08.960]   farm, you have three types of tools. You have dumb tools," and by dumb, he means can't speak.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:14.720]   So that's like shovels, picks, things like this, wagons. "You have semi-articulate tools,
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:21.120]   which are animals, and you have articulate tools, which are human beings, slaves."
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:27.440]   And for him, these are all just categories of tools. It's so intensely dehumanizing to
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:33.360]   view people in that way. So Roman slavery is odd in that it doesn't have this racial component.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.800]   It's horrible in the way all slavery is horrible. But the other thing about it is it's not a hard
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:46.960]   line. It's a permeable membrane, and many people move back and forth across it. So you have many
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:51.280]   people in the Roman world who were born a slave who gained their freedom through one means or
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:55.200]   another. And you have many others who were born free and become slaves, and you have some who go
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:00.800]   back and forth. There's a great Roman tombstone of this guy who says, "I was born a free man in
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:06.400]   Parthia. I was enslaved. Then I gained my freedom, and I became a teacher or something, and I had a
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:12.080]   life, and now I'm a Roman citizen." So it's this whole back and forth across all these boundaries
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:17.840]   multiple times. Oh, so there's probably a process, like an economic transaction.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:24.080]   The most common source of slaves in the Roman world was war. So wherever the Roman army went,
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:30.000]   in its wake would be literally a train of slave traders. So you're in war,
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.840]   you capture an enemy city, you whack the people over the head, and you turn around if you're a
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.360]   soldier, and you sell them to one of these slave traders that's following the army around,
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:42.400]   literally. So that's probably the biggest source of slaves. Another big source is just children of
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:50.560]   slaves or slaves. And some people could literally sell either themselves or their children into
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:57.680]   slavery due to economic necessity or privation or something. So as terrible as that sounds,
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:07.040]   a father could sell a child if he needed money. Once you were a slave though, the experience of
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:14.560]   slavery varied a lot because a lot of the slaves were agricultural slaves. So they would work
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:21.040]   like in the American South, big plantations, they might be chained, they were probably abused.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.760]   That's very similar to slavery as we think of it in, let's say, the Caribbean, South America,
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.720]   or the United States prior to the Civil War, that kind of slavery. But a lot of Roman slaves
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:36.000]   were also some of the more skilled people. And this seems a little weird. So if you're a rich
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.720]   person, you have slaves, it's actually a good investment for you to train your slaves in a
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:49.040]   profession. So a lot of Roman doctors, scribes, accountants, all this sort of thing, barbers,
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.800]   were slaves. Because if you train this person and then they produce a lot of money for you,
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:20:01.200]   you get that money. And those slaves would sometimes be given an incentive to work hard
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.680]   where they could, and this is just an agreement between the master and the slave, if they
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:11.280]   earned a certain amount of money, X amount of money, they could then buy their own freedom
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.280]   from the master. So this was your incentive to work harder if you were trained, let's say,
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:21.520]   as a doctor, I work really hard, I can buy myself out of slavery. Or a lot of masters would free
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:27.440]   their slaves and their wills. So when they died, they would say, "I manumit this slave and that
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:34.400]   slave." So it was a weird institution in that it was, elements were just as horrible as what we
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:38.960]   think of as slavery and just as exploitative. And like I say, the overall notion of slavery is
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:46.240]   intensely dehumanizing, but yet there was this wide range of types of slaves. And the odd thing
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:54.000]   is in the city of Rome, many of the worst jobs, so if you're just a laborer hauling crap around
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:01.200]   the docks or things like that, you might well be a free person and a slave would hold a skilled job.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:06.160]   And that seems a little strange or counterintuitive to us, but you see how in the Roman
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.320]   economy, it sort of works.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:13.440]   And that could be one of the things that would be surprising to us coming from the modern day
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:18.560]   to the ancient world is just the number of slaves. So you mentioned one of the things we don't think
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.400]   about is that most of the people are farmers. And then the other thing is just the number of slaves.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.880]   And there's a big debate, how many slaves were there? What percentage of the populace,
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:33.040]   let's say in the city of Rome were slaves? And this is something historians like to argue about
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:37.840]   a lot. And we keep coming back to this theme of sometimes it's the little things that illustrate
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:43.360]   stuff well. And for slaves, the one that always gets me is some slaves, and these would be sort
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:49.680]   of the more abused slaves, they would literally put little bronze collars on them with a tag
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:56.400]   that said, "Hi, my name is Felix. I'm the slave of so-and-so. I've run away. If you catch me,
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:01.360]   return me to the temple of so-and-so and you'll get a reward." So it's a dog tag, right? Except
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:05.440]   this is a human being. And you can see these in museums. I mean, you can go to a museum today and
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:10.560]   see this little bronze collar with a tag on it that's talking about a human being as if they're
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.440]   this kind of animal that's run away. And this is very telling too. We're talking about Roman law.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:22.400]   Under Roman law, technically, when a slave runs away, the crime that he's committing is theft
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:30.720]   because he's stolen himself from his master. So again, it's this very dehumanizing view of it.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:35.680]   And just a reminder to people in America thinking about this, we have a certain
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:44.160]   view and picture to what slavery is, a reminder that all of human history, most of human history
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:53.840]   has had slaves of all colors, of all religions. That's within us to select a group of people,
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:23:01.680]   call them the other, use them as objects, abuse them. And I would say as a person who believes
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:07.280]   the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man, all of us, every person
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:14.400]   listening to this is capable of being owner of a slave if they're put in the position of capable
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:20.880]   of hating the other, of forming the other, of othering other people. And we should be very
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:27.120]   careful not to look ourselves in the mirror and remind ourselves that we're human. It's easy to
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.760]   kind of think, okay, well, there's these slaves and slave owners through history and I would have
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:40.960]   never been one of those. But just like as we would be farmers, we could be both, if we went back into
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:44.880]   history, we could be both slaves and slave owners, and all of those are humans.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:52.000]   I mean, just to build on that, I'd say the othering of others is a morally corrosive thing to do.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.120]   Yeah. So this fascinating transition between the Republic to the Empire,
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.760]   can we talk about that? How does the Republic fall?
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:12.240]   Oh boy. Okay. So the Roman Republic on the one hand is incredibly successful, right? In a short
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:17.280]   period of time, it's expanded wildly, it's conquered the Mediterranean world, it's gained
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:26.640]   tons of wealth. The contradiction here is that Rome's very success has made almost every group
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:33.760]   within Roman society deeply unhappy and boiling with resentment. So this is the contradiction.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:39.120]   Enormous success on the surface, you end up with this boiling pot of resentment and unhappiness.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:45.520]   So let's break this down. Who's unhappy? Well, the people fighting Rome's wars,
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:49.280]   the common farmers who went off to fight. They joined the army, they went and fought,
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.840]   they've come back, they've seen Rome get wealthy, they've seen their generals get wealthy,
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.280]   they've conquered all these areas, all this money and stuff is flowing back to Rome,
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.360]   but when they're discharged from the army, they don't get that much. So they feel like,
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:06.800]   I spent the best years of my life fighting for my country, I deserve a reward, I haven't gotten it.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.680]   So you have a lot of veterans who are now unemployed or underemployed. Many of them have
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.640]   sold their small family farms when they went off to join the army, and now they don't have them.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:24.160]   So that group's unhappy, the veterans. You have the aristocrats, who on the surface,
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.280]   the ones who are doing well, they're the politicians and the generals. But as time goes on,
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:34.320]   the ones who get the plum appointments, who get the good generalships, starts coming from a smaller
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:39.920]   and smaller subset of the aristocrats. The Scipios and their friends start to dominate.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:44.400]   So you end up where most of the aristocratic class is feeling, "Hey, I'm left out,
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:49.120]   I didn't get what I deserved." What about the half-citizens and the allies, the Italians,
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:53.360]   who have fought for Rome, who stayed loyal when Hannibal invaded? They didn't go over to his side.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:59.520]   Well, they feel, rightfully, we stayed loyal to Rome, we fought for them, we deserve our reward,
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.600]   we should be full citizens. But the Romans are traditional, they're conservative,
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:09.040]   they don't like change, they don't give them that. What about all the slaves? Well,
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.960]   they've conquered all these foreigners, they've sold them, now many of them are working these
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:18.400]   plantations, big plantations owned by rich people that used to be little family farms.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:23.920]   The slaves are obviously unhappy. So you end up with a society where it's incredibly successful
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:30.800]   by about 100 BC, but almost every group that composes it feels like, "I haven't shared in
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:35.760]   the benefits of what's happened, or I've been exploited by it." So they all end up intensely
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:42.640]   unhappy. And the next 100-year period, from 133 to 31 BC, is called the Late Roman Republic,
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:48.400]   and it's a time of nearly constant internal strife, ultimately culminating in multiple
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:57.200]   rounds of civil war. So Roman society literally breaks apart, turns on itself, and goes to war
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:04.480]   with itself over not equitably sharing the benefits of conquest and of empire. So it's
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:09.440]   a lesson about not sharing the benefits of something in a society, but concentrating
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:15.280]   it in one little group. And the other thing that happens is among the aristocrats, they start to
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:21.120]   get more and more ambitious. So in the past, there was a lot of ideology of the state is more
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:25.520]   important than the person. If you were a little Roman kid, you would have been told these stories
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:30.320]   of Roman heroes, and they're all about self-sacrifice, putting the state before you,
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:36.400]   about modesty, about these sort of values. Well, by the Late Republic, you have a succession of
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:43.600]   strongmen. And it is a chain. So it goes, Marius, Sully, Pompey, Julius Caesar,
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:50.480]   where each one pushes the boundaries of the Roman Republic a little bit, pushes at the
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:56.080]   structures of the institutions of the Republic, and they're motivated by personal gain. They're
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:02.960]   putting themselves above the state. So at the same time, you have lots of groups unhappy in society,
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:08.080]   and you get these strongmen who are now undermining the institutions, chipping away at
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:14.720]   the things that have been shared, things holding the state together. And in the end, they just
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:19.520]   become so ambitious. They're like, "I don't care about the state. I'm going to try and make myself
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:24.560]   ruler of Rome." So I mean, this is going to culminate, obviously, in Julius Caesar,
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:31.280]   who does succeed in making himself dictator for life of the Roman Republic, which is tantamount
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:37.760]   to king, and he gets assassinated for it. But he's the end point of this progression of people
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:43.120]   who really undermine the institutions of the Republic through their own personal greed.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:47.840]   So the resentment boils and boils and boils, and there's this person that puts themselves...
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.680]   And they exploit it. They're demagogues.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:50.640]   They exploit it.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:57.360]   But Caesar puts himself above the state. And that, I guess, the Roman people also hate.
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:03.360]   Well, I mean, it's a love-hate because Caesar is very successful at playing to the Roman people.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:09.680]   So he becomes their hero where he says, "I'll be your champion against the state who doesn't care
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:16.080]   about you." So Caesar will do things where he'll put on big shows for the people, and it's cynical.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:21.120]   I mean, he's doing this to further his own political power, but he's presenting himself
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:28.880]   as a populist in essence, even though he aspires to be a dictator, right? But it's a way of winning
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:33.920]   the people's support because that's a tool for him and his struggle with other aristocrats.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.400]   So a dictator in populist clothing.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.440]   Yes.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:42.880]   When convenient. Other times he'll play to the aristocracy.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:49.920]   And when he gets assassinated, another civil war explodes?
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:54.400]   That's an interesting moment because all these things have been leading up to Caesar. And it
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.800]   really is a chain of men. So it starts with this guy, Marius, who is one of the first to start
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:04.800]   making armies loyal to him rather than to the state. That's a step in the wrong direction,
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:09.040]   right? The army should be loyal to the state, not to an individual general. They shouldn't look for
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:14.640]   him to rewards. Marius kind of breaks that, makes a precedent. One of his protégés is a guy named
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:21.360]   Sulla. Sulla comes along and he ends up marching on Rome with his army and taking it over. And he
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.960]   says, "Well, I'm just doing it for the good of the state." But that's another precedent. Now
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.680]   you've had someone attacking their own capital city, even if they say they're doing it for the
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:36.480]   right reasons. Then Pompey comes along and Pompey just breaks all kinds of things. He starts holding
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:43.840]   offices when he's too young to do so. He raises personal armies from his own wealth. He disobeys
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:49.520]   commands. He manipulates commands. He does all kinds of stuff. But in the end, he sides with
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:54.480]   the Senate when sort of forced. And finally, Caesar comes along and Caesar's just shamelessly,
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:31:00.640]   "No, it's about me. I'm going to push it." And he is the one who wins a civil war against the state
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:06.880]   and Pompey, takes over Rome and says, "Now I'm going to be dictator." And dictator is a traditional
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:11.760]   office in the Roman state, but dictators were limited to no more than six months in power.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:17.360]   And Caesar says, "Well, I'll be dictator for life," which of course is king. He gets killed for it.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:25.680]   So Caesar succeeded in taking over the state as one man, but he couldn't solve the problem.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:33.840]   How do you rule Rome as one person and not get killed for looking like a king? That's the dilemma,
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:40.240]   the riddle that Caesar leaves behind him. He did it. He seized powers, one guy, but how do you stay
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:45.040]   alive? How do you come up with something that the people will accept? And Caesar did some other
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:51.040]   things which were bad. He was arrogant. He didn't even pretend that the Senate were his equals. He
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:56.560]   just kind of railroaded them around. He didn't respect them. He named a month after himself,
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:03.440]   July, Julius. He did egotistical things. So that pissed people off. They didn't like it.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:08.560]   And when Caesar dies, it's this interesting moment. The Republic's sort of dead by then.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:13.200]   You're going to have a hard time reviving it. You've broken too many precedents.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:17.120]   But there's a power vacuum now. Caesar's gone. What's going to happen next?
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:22.880]   And you have a whole group of people who want to be the next Caesar. So the most obvious is
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:27.280]   Mark Antony, who is Caesar's right-hand man, his lieutenant. He's a very good general. He's
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:31.760]   very charismatic. Everybody kind of expects Mark Antony to just become the next Caesar.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:36.560]   But there's also another of Caesar's lieutenants, a guy named Lepidus, sort of like Antony,
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:41.520]   but not quite as great as him. There's the Senate itself, which wants to reassert its power,
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:46.240]   kind of become the dominant force in Rome again. There's the assassins who killed Caesar,
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:51.280]   led by Brutus and another guy, Cassius. They now want to seize control.
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:55.840]   And finally, there's a really weird dark horse candidate to fill this power vacuum.
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:03.040]   And that's Julius Caesar's grand nephew, who at the time is a 17-year-old kid named Octavian.
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:10.720]   Who cares? He's nobody, absolutely nobody. But when Caesar's will is opened after his death,
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:17.440]   so posthumously read, in his will, Caesar posthumously, and this is a little weird,
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:24.640]   posthumously adopts Octavian as his son. Now, again, who cares? Antony gets the troops. Antony
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:29.440]   gets the money. The other people get everything. What does Octavian get? He gets to now rename
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:37.600]   himself Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus. Who cares? Well, around the Mediterranean, there's about
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:44.240]   12 legions full of hardened soldiers who are just kind of used to following a guy named Gaius
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:50.240]   Julius Caesar. And even though it's not quite logical, this 18-year-old, he's now 18-year-old
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:56.800]   kid, inherits an army overnight. So he becomes a player in this game for power. And the next
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.960]   30, 40 years is going to be those groups all vying with one another. There's another candidate to
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:07.600]   Pompey's son. Pompey was Caesar's great rival. He has a couple sons, and one of them, a guy named
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:13.280]   Sextus Pompey, basically becomes a warlord who seizes control of Sicily, one of the richest
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:20.000]   provinces, has a whole navy. He's vying to be one of these successors too. So for the next 40 years,
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.760]   it's, as you said, another civil war to see which guy emerges. Is it going to be the Senate? Is it
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.800]   going to be the Assassins? Is it going to be Antony? Is it going to be Lepidus? Is it going
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:33.680]   to be Sextus Pompey? Is it going to be Octavian? So now looking back at all that history,
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:39.840]   it just feels like history turns on so many interesting accidents, because Octavian,
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:46.880]   later renamed Augustus, turned out to be actually, depends how you define good, but a good
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:53.760]   king/emperor, different than Caesar in terms of humility, at least being able to play
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:01.760]   not to piss off everybody. But he could have been so many other people. That could have been the
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:07.760]   fall of Rome. So it's a fascinating little turn of history. Maybe Caesar saw something in this
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:13.840]   individual. It's not an accident that he was in the will. Yeah. I mean, Caesar clearly did see
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:20.000]   something in him. And Octavian, I mean, to cut to the end, is the one who emerges from all that as
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.560]   the victor. We can talk about how he does it, but he's the one who sort of ends up in the same
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:29.920]   position as Caesar. It takes him 30 years, but he defeats all the foes. He's the sole guy.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:35.200]   He now faces Caesar's riddle. How do you rule Rome as one guy and not get killed?
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:42.000]   And Octavian's, what makes him stand out, what makes him fascinating to me is he wasn't a good
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.440]   general. In fact, he was a terrible general. He lost almost every battle he commanded. But what
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:54.480]   he is, is he's politically savvy, and he's very good at what today we would call manipulation of
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:36:01.680]   your public image and propaganda. So he basically defeats Mark Antony partially by waging a
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:07.680]   propaganda war against him. I mean, Antony starts out as a legitimate rival, and there are two
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:14.480]   Romans vying for power. At the end of this war, propaganda war, Octavian has managed to portray
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:22.080]   Antony as a foreign aggressor allied with an enemy king or queen, in this case, Cleopatra,
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:27.440]   and who is an official enemy of the Roman state. And that's all propaganda. So he takes what's a
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:34.720]   civil war and makes it look like a war against a foreign enemy. And when Octavian becomes the sole
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:40.160]   ruler, he looks at what Caesar did wrong, and he very carefully avoids the same mistakes.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:46.160]   So the first thing is just how he lives his life. He's very modest. He lives in an ordinary house
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.960]   like other aristocrats. He wears just a plain toga, nothing fancy. He's respectful to the
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:56.560]   Senate. He treats them with respect. He eats simple foods. I mean, he's someone who cared about
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:02.480]   the reality of power, not the external trappings. Clearly, there are some rulers who love, "I want
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:06.720]   to dress in fancy clothes. I want to be surrounded by gold, everything. This is what makes me feel
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.520]   good." Octavian's the opposite. He doesn't care about any of that. He wants real power.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.760]   And then the other thing is, how is he going to rule Rome without looking like a king?
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:22.400]   And his solution to this is brilliant. He basically pretends to resign from all his
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:28.240]   public offices. Not pretends, he does. So he holds no official office. But what he does is he
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:35.120]   manipulates so that the Roman Senate votes him the powers of the key Roman offices,
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:40.800]   but not the office itself. So the highest office in the Roman state is the consul. Consuls have
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.480]   the power to command armies, do all sorts of things, run meetings of the Senate.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:50.720]   Octavian gets voted the powers of a consul. So he can command armies, control meetings of the
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.320]   Senate, do all this, but he's not one of the two consuls elected for every year.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:00.000]   So he's just kind of floating or drifting off to the side of the Roman government.
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:05.360]   He gets the power of a tribune, which has all sorts of powers. He can veto anything he wants,
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:11.760]   but he's not one of the tribunes elected for any one year. So the state, the Republic, appears to
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.280]   continue as it always has. Each year, they hold the same elections. They elect the same number
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:20.560]   of people. Notionally, those people are in charge. But floating off to the side, you have this guy,
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:27.200]   Octavian, who has equivalent power not just to any one magistrate or official, but to all of them.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:32.240]   So at any moment, he can just sort of pop up and say, "No, let's not do this. Let's do something
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:36.240]   else." And he also keeps the army under his personal control.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:41.280]   Isn't this a fascinating story? What do you think is the psychology of Augustus of Octavian?
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.400]   Yeah. And he later changed his name to Augustus when he sort of becomes first emperor. And the
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:49.600]   other thing he does is he hides his power behind all these different names. So Caesar called himself
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.920]   dictator for life, right? So everybody knew what he was. Octavian, we even have a source that talks
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:58.000]   about it. He says he wondered what to call himself. Do I call myself king? No, I can't do that.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.400]   Dictator for life? No way. Maybe I'll call myself Romulus. That was the founder of Rome. No, no,
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:10.240]   Romulus was a king. And finally, a solution is he takes a bunch of titles, which are all ambiguous,
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:16.400]   and no one of them sounds that impressive, but collectively, they are.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:21.920]   So for example, one of the titles he gets is Augustus, which is something tied to Roman
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:28.320]   religion. Something that is Augustus in Latin has two possible meanings. One is someone who is
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:34.000]   Augustus is very pious. They respect the gods deeply. Well, that sounds nice, doesn't it?
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.240]   Well, on the other hand, an alternative meaning for Augustus is something that is itself divine.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:46.000]   So is he just a deeply religious, pious person, or is he himself sacred? There's that ambiguity.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:53.600]   He calls himself princeps, which means first citizen. Okay. What the hell does that mean?
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:59.920]   Am I a citizen just like everybody else, or am I the first citizen, which means I'm superior to all
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:05.280]   the others? So every title he takes has this weird ambiguity. He calls himself imperator,
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:11.600]   which is traditionally something that soldiers shout at a victorious general who's won a battle.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:15.760]   And now he takes this as a permanent title. So it implies he's a good general.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:21.760]   And by the way, it's from imperator that we get the word emperor and empire. So originally,
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.600]   it's a military title, a spontaneous military acclamation.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:30.000]   It's just fascinating that he figured out a way through public image, through branding
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:44.000]   to gain power, maintain power, and still pacify the boiling turmoil that led to the civil wars.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.760]   Yeah. Well, two things I think work in his favor as well. One is he brings peace
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:56.400]   and stability. So by this point, the Romans have experienced 100 years almost of civil war
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:02.960]   and chaos. So at that point, your family, maybe you've had family members die in these wars or
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.440]   been prescribed, your property has been confiscated, who knows what. And here's a guy
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:12.800]   who brings peace and stability and doesn't seem oppressive or cruel or whatever. So you're like,
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:18.160]   okay, fine. I don't care. Maybe he's killed the Republic, but at least we're not dying in the
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:24.000]   streets anymore. So that's a big thing he does. And secondly, even though Augustus always seemed
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:32.000]   kind of sickly, his constitution, he lives forever. He rules for like 50 years. And by the time he
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:39.760]   dies, there's no one literally almost left alive who can remember the Republic. So at that point,
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.800]   by the time he dies, this is the only system we know.
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:49.440]   That's another just fascinating accident of history. Because as we talked about with
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:57.680]   Alexander the Great, who knows if he lived for another 40 years. If over time, the people that
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:05.040]   hate the new thing die off and then their sons come into power, that could be a very different
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.480]   story. Maybe we'll be talking about the Greek Empire.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:09.760]   That's a fluke of fate, but it's hugely influential on history.
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:13.920]   You mentioned Cleopatra. If we go back to that, what role did she play?
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.480]   Another fascinating human being.
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:24.160]   Cleopatra is interesting. I mean, she was a direct descendant of one of Alexander the Great's
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:29.600]   generals, Ptolemy. When Alexander's empire had broken up, Ptolemy, this general, had seized
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:36.000]   control of Egypt, made it his kingdom. And she, 10 generations later, is a descendant of this
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.120]   Macedonian general. So Egypt had been ruled by, in essence, foreigners, these Macedonian
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.920]   dynasty of kings. And often, they literally were ruled by the same dynasty because they had a
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:53.200]   habit of marrying brothers to sisters. And Cleopatra is, in fact, originally married to her
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:43:02.960]   younger brother. But despite that, she seems to have intensely identified with Egypt. In fact,
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:07.600]   she seems to have been the first one of all these Ptolemy kings who actually bothered to learn to
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:14.560]   speak Egyptian. So she seemed to really have cared about Egypt as well. And she was clearly very
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:22.480]   smart, very clever. And so she's living at a time during the late Republic, when Rome is having all
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:28.640]   these civil wars, and Egypt is really the last big independent kingdom left around the shores of the
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:34.960]   Mediterranean. Everything else has been conquered by Rome. So she is in this very precarious
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:39.680]   position where clearly she wants to maintain Egyptian independence, but Rome is this juggernaut
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:46.000]   that's rolling over everything. And she ends up meeting Julius Caesar when Caesar comes to Egypt,
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.040]   chasing Pompey, his great rival. After he defeats Pompey, Pompey runs to Egypt thinking he'll find
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.360]   sanctuary there. And the Egyptians kill him and chop off his head. And when Caesar lands,
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.880]   they hand it to him and say, "Here, have a present." And she, of course, famously ends
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:07.520]   up having a love affair with Caesar. Was that a genuine love or was she just using this as a way
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:14.000]   to try and keep Egypt independent to give it some status? We don't know. She does have several kids
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.720]   with Caesar. After Caesar is assassinated and the Roman world is having another civil war between
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:26.080]   Octavian and Mark Antony, Mark Antony is basing himself in the east. He meets Cleopatra and he has
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:32.560]   a big love affair with her. And this one seems pretty genuine. I mean, Antony and Cleopatra,
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:37.760]   there's a lot of stories about them kind of partying together. They like to sort of cosplay
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:44.400]   and dress up as different gods. So Cleopatra would dress up as the goddess Isis and Antony would
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:49.120]   dress up as the god Dionysus in a leopard skin and they'd have these big parties and stuff.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:54.880]   And they end up together fighting against Octavian. And in the end, they're defeated
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:03.680]   by Octavian and Antony commits suicide. Cleopatra, there's differing accounts of her death. She may
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:08.480]   have also killed herself or she may actually have been killed by Octavian to just get her
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:14.800]   out of the way. But she's an interesting figure because she was clearly a very smart woman who
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:20.240]   managed to keep Egypt alive as an independent state. She seemed to have actually cared about
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:27.120]   Egypt and identified with it and succeeded a time with all these famous people in being a real kind
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:31.600]   of mover and shaker and a force in events. >> I mean, she's probably one of the most
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:38.240]   influential women in human history. >> She's certainly, again, she's someone that her image
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:43.920]   is incredibly important. And I mean, one of the interesting things, the whole question of gender
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:48.320]   in the Roman world, I mean, this gets into Roman sources, but of course, it's a heavily male
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:54.480]   dominated history. And I mean, men and women did not have equality in ancient Rome. It's a male
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:46:00.000]   dominated society. It's misogynist in many ways. But what I'm constantly struck by is when you
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.320]   start again delving into the sources, you always hear, okay, well, there was this one woman who was
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:11.680]   a philosopher and she's an exception to the rule. And yeah, okay, she's fine. And then you start
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:16.640]   looking at, oh, and there's also 60 other female philosophers. Well, is that so much an exception
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:21.600]   anymore? Or Cleopatra is the one queen, she's this strong queen. And then you're looking, well,
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.720]   there was this other queen here, there was this queen here, there was this queen here who led
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:29.520]   armies, and here's another one who led armies. And again, it's like, well, are they exceptions to the
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:34.400]   rule or is just the history that was written, which is written by men, a little bit selective
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:40.000]   in how it portrays them? Because the sources are all these male elites who have very definite ideas
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:46.880]   about women. The conventional notion has always been that business in the Roman Empire was a male
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:52.640]   field. Well, but then there's this woman, Eumachia in Pompeii, who actually had the largest building
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:58.080]   in Pompeii right on the forum named after her with a giant statue of her. And she was a patron to a
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:02.400]   bunch of the most important guilds in Pompeii. Okay, she's the exception to the rule. Oh, but
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:07.280]   then there's these other four women we have from Pompeii who also were patrons of guilds.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:11.680]   And then there's this woman, Plancia Magna, in this other place, and she was the most important
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.480]   patron in the town and put up all these statues. So at some point, when do you start to say, well,
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:22.640]   maybe women did play more of a role, but they just haven't been recorded in the sources in the way
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:27.760]   that maybe they deserve to be? Yeah, that's a fascinating question. Is it the bias of society
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.560]   or is it the bias of the historian? The bias of the society that the historian is writing
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:36.240]   about or the bias of the actual historian? And the bias of the historians who have written
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:42.400]   history up to this point. I was just writing a lecture which was about this woman, Musa,
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:50.480]   who is a crazy story, and she ties into Augustus actually. Augustus, his biggest diplomatic triumph
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:56.880]   that he boasted about constantly was that about 50 years before him, the Romans had sent an
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:03.440]   expedition into Parthia, this neighboring kingdom led by Crassus, and they'd gotten wiped out. So
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:09.520]   it was this big disaster, military disaster. And the standards of the Roman legions, the eagles
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:14.800]   that each Roman legion carried had been captured by the Parthians. And this is the most humiliating
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:20.240]   thing that can happen to a Roman legion, to have its eagles captured. And Augustus desperately
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:25.360]   wanted to negotiate with the Parthians to get these eagles returned. This was his big diplomatic
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.320]   thing. So he was constantly sending these embassies to Parthia. On one of these embassies,
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:34.880]   he sent along as a gift to the Parthian king, a slave woman named Musa.
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:41.600]   Musa seems to have pleased the king of Parthia because she becomes one of his concubines.
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:47.120]   And then she gives birth to a son by the king, and eventually she becomes upgraded to the level
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:58.240]   of a wife. And Musa eventually murders the Parthian king, arranges it so that her son
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:05.440]   becomes the king of Parthia. And she's really ruling the whole empire behind the scenes as
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:12.400]   his mother. So this is a literal rags to riches story of a slave, someone who starts out a slave
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:19.760]   and becomes the queen of an empire almost as large and powerful as Rome. Okay. But yet,
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:26.240]   how often do we hear about Musa? And when you look in traditional histories of Roman Parthian
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.800]   relations, and I went and looked at this because I was just writing this lecture,
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:34.160]   most of those histories didn't even mention her. They just talked about her son, like he had just
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:39.040]   come out of nowhere and become the new heir to the Parthian throne when it was all her doing,
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:46.800]   clearly. Now that's selective editing of history by historians to downplay the role that this woman
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:52.080]   played. And there's a lot of examples like that. >> That's fascinating.
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:55.440]   >> She got overthrown after a few years. There was a revolution against her, and we don't know
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:01.040]   what happened to her then. But she's a really interesting figure. Oh, and by the way, Augustus
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:06.720]   did negotiate the return of the Parthian standards and got them back. And he was so proud of this,
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:11.360]   that this is what he constantly boasted about. And the most famous statue of Augustus, the Augustus
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:17.280]   from Prima Porta, which is in the Vatican today, he's wearing a breastplate. And on the breastplate,
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.360]   right in the middle of the stomach, is a Parthian handing over a golden eagle,
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:26.000]   legionary standard to a Roman. So this is what Augustus thought of as his greatest achievement.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.520]   And that embassy that arranged that was the one that sent Musa to Parthia.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:39.680]   >> So Augustus marks the start of the Roman Empire. You've written that Octavian Augustus
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:44.880]   would become Rome's first emperor, and the political system that he created would endure
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:51.920]   for the next half a millennium. This system would become the template for countless later empires
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:58.080]   up through the present day, and he would become the model emperor against whom all subsequent ones
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:02.800]   would be measured. The culture and history of the Mediterranean basin, the Western world,
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:08.560]   and even global history itself were all profoundly shaped and influenced by the actions and legacy of
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:14.800]   Octavian. He was the founder of the Roman Empire, and we still live today in the world that he
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:22.320]   created. So on the political side of things, and maybe beyond, what is the political system
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.960]   that he created? >> Well, I mean,
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:30.560]   I think Octavian/Augustus, it's the same guy, is one of the most influential people in history
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.120]   because he did found the Roman Empire. So he's the one who oversaw this transition from republic
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:40.720]   to empire, and he sets the template which every future emperor follows. So just in the most
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:46.080]   obvious way, for the next either 500 or 1,500 years, depending how long you think the Roman
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:51.200]   Empire lasted for, everyone is trying to be Augustus. They all take on the same titles.
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:58.480]   Every Roman emperor after him is Caesar, Augustus, Imperator, or Potter, all these titles he has,
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:04.960]   they take too. And so he's hugely influential for Western civilization and all this.
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:10.880]   But beyond just that literal thing, which is already 500 years, 1,500 years, he becomes the
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:19.360]   paradigm of the good ruler, so of an absolute ruler who is nevertheless sort of just does good
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:25.760]   things, builds public works, is popular. So if we jump ahead, let's say, to the Middle Ages,
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:30.080]   the most significant ruler of the early Middle Ages is Charlemagne, right? He's the guy who
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:35.920]   unites most of Europe. He becomes the paradigm for all medieval kings after him. Well, what is
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:41.120]   the title that the Pope gives to Charlemagne? Because there's this famous moment when the Pope
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:45.600]   acknowledges Charlemagne as the preeminent European king and crowns him on Christmas
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:52.320]   Day of the year 800. And the title that the Pope gives to Charlemagne is Charles, that's
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:53:01.040]   Charlemagne, Augustus, Emperor of the Romans. He's giving him the title of Augustus because that's
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:06.560]   the nicest thing he can think of to say to Charlemagne, is to say, "You're the new Augustus,
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:13.440]   you're Emperor of the Romans." So that image is hugely powerful. And that persists on and on.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:20.720]   I mean, even the literal names of most rulers afterwards come from this. In Russia, the Tsars
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:27.760]   are Caesars. That's where Tsar comes from. Prince comes from Princeps, First Citizen,
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.560]   one of the titles. Emperor comes from Imperator, one of the titles of Augustus.
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:38.720]   When Napoleon becomes Emperor, what does he call himself? First Consul, which is kind of like
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:45.520]   Princeps. And then he calls himself Emperor. I mean, everybody wants to be this kind of ruler.
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:50.960]   So he's the paradigm of this for the rest of history. And you can see that is both a positive
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:56.320]   and a negative legacy. It's kind of like Alexander. I mean, everybody wants to be the next Alexander.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:01.280]   Now, nobody does become the next Alexander. Nobody's as successful as him, but a lot of people
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:07.920]   try. And you can see that either is, oh, inspirational or awful because lots of people
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.960]   killed lots of other people and started lots of wars trying to be the next Alexander.
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:19.600]   At least Augustus has this notion of good rulership, that you're not just a great powerful
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:24.480]   person, but you're a good ruler somehow. Can you speak to the kind of political
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:33.360]   system he created? How did he consolidate power, as you spoke to a bit already? And
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:40.320]   what role did the Senate now play? How were the laws? Who was the executive? How was power
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:49.440]   allocated and so on? Yeah. So once the empire begins, let's say 27 BC. So in 31 BC, Octavian
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:54.400]   defeats Antony at the Battle of Actium. So that's kind of the moment he becomes the sole ruler.
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:59.920]   And then in 27 BC, a couple of years later, he settles the Roman Republic, as it's referred to,
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:06.160]   which basically sets up his system. And in this system, on the surface, it all looks the same.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:12.000]   You still have a Senate. Each year, there's elections. All the Roman citizens vote. They
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:18.320]   elect magistrates who notionally are in charge of Rome. But as I mentioned, off to the side,
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:22.720]   you now have this figure of Augustus who sort of controls everything behind the scenes.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:29.760]   And that continues. So this political system he establishes continues. And in reality,
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:37.120]   I would say Augustus at that point is again a king. It really is one man controlling the state,
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:42.800]   even if notionally, it's still continuing as a republic. They are electing magistrates,
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:48.160]   but the magistrates only do what the emperor tells them, right? But it's this sort of formal
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:54.560]   versus informal power. The formal structure is a republic. The way things really work informally
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:00.160]   is it's a monarchy. Now, if you asked Augustus, what did he do? Did you become a king?
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:07.520]   He said, and he says this explicitly, "No, no, no. What I did is I refounded the Roman Republic."
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:11.120]   That's how he phrases it. >> Yeah, this guy's good at framing.
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:14.560]   >> He's so good at propaganda. I'll give you one more example that I love.
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:20.000]   Augustus actually writes his own autobiography, which is very rare and survives. So here we have
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.560]   the autobiography of one of the pivotal figures in history. And if you had conquered the world,
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:30.000]   let's say, starting at the age of 18, what would you call your autobiography? It'd be something
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:36.720]   like, "How I Conquered the World," right? Augustus calls his, "The Res Gestae," which the best sort
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:42.880]   of literal translation is, "Stuff I Did." I mean, it's the most modest title for someone who could
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:49.760]   have given the most grandiose title. And the first line of it is, "At the age of 18, when the liberty
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:56.320]   of the Republic was oppressed by a faction, I defended it." Now, the way I might phrase that
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:01.600]   sense is, "At the age of 18, I fought a civil war against another Roman and conquered the Roman
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:06.720]   state." But no, he defended the liberty of the Republic when it was oppressed by the tyranny
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:13.440]   of a faction. That's propaganda, and it works. >> It is propaganda, but is there a degree to
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:20.320]   which he also lived it, that kind of humility? Establishing that humility is a standard of the
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:26.080]   way government operates. So it's not like a literal direct balance of power, but it's sort
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:30.960]   of a cultural balance of power, where the emperor is not supposed to be a bully and a dictator.
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:38.480]   >> I would really like to know what Romans of his time thought. If you were alive at that moment,
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:44.400]   would you honestly believe, "Oh, okay, we've got this guy Augustus, but he's brought peace. He's
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:48.400]   just kind of keeping in charge for a while till things settle down. We've just had 100 years of
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:54.560]   civil war. I think we still have a republic." Or would you say, "Nah, we have a king now." And I
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:58:01.600]   don't know what the answer to that is. I will tell you that it takes 200 years before we have the
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:10.080]   first Roman source that bluntly calls Augustus a king. So 200 years. It takes the Romans 200 years
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:15.920]   to admit to themselves, and that's a guy who comes along 200 years later and says, "Hey,
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:21.840]   Augustus, he looks like a king. He acts like a king. Let's just call him a king," because he had
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:27.200]   every aspect of a king except the paltry title. >> Maybe I'm buying his propaganda, and maybe I'm
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:33.520]   a sucker for humility, but I suspect that the Romans bought it. And I also suspect he himself
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:40.320]   believed it. I mean, there is such thing as good kings, right? There's kings that understand
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:47.760]   the downside, the dark side of absolute power and can wield that power properly.
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:52.240]   >> And to give sort of both sides here, Augustus wasn't all nice. I mean, there were moments where
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:58.480]   he was extremely cruel. So early in his career, when he's still fighting for power, he goes all
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:05.280]   in on prescriptions, which is where he and Ante and other people basically post lists of their
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:10.880]   enemies and say, "It's legal for anyone to kill these people." And so hundreds are massacred
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:16.240]   there, including Cicero, the Great Order, is prescribed and killed. There's moments when he's
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:20.720]   really cruel. One slave once gets him angry, and he has him tortured in a particularly sort of cruel
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:25.680]   manner. So I mean, on the one hand, he had this clemency. On the other hand, he could be really
[01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:31.600]   hard-nosed and hard-edged. And I think he was a very calculating person. >> So the thing I would
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:37.440]   love to know is what he was actually like behind the mask. >> Yes, yes. I mean, that to me is one
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:41.440]   of those, like, if you could invite a historical person to dinner or whatever, I want to know what
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:47.040]   the real Augustus was, what he really thought he was doing, because he's an enigma. And he has this
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:53.680]   great moment when he dies, right? What's his dying lines on his deathbed? He says, "If I've played my
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:59.760]   part well, dismiss me from the stage with applause." So he's seeing himself as an actor, that
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:05.600]   his whole life was acting this role, which is, again, all that manipulation and public image. He
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:10.160]   was brilliant at that, but who's the real guy? What was behind that image? >> And by the way,
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:16.320]   as long as we're talking about brutality, I think you've mentioned in a few places that
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:25.440]   there's a lot of brutality going on at the time, Caesar just killing very large numbers of people
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:34.080]   brutally. >> I mean, Caesar, his campaigns in Gaul are interesting, because for a long time,
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:38.880]   they were held up as, "Oh, genius general, look at the amazing things he did." But another way
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:44.240]   to view it is he provoked, and he truly provoked a war with people who were not that interested in
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:49.600]   fighting Rome, and just repeatedly attacked different tribes for the sole purpose of
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:57.440]   building up his career, his prestige, his status, gaining territory, making himself wealthier.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:02.960]   And he basically conquers all of modern France, and Belgium, and some of Switzerland. So this is
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:09.200]   a big chunk of Europe gets conquered, hundreds of thousands of people killed, hundreds of thousands
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:15.440]   of people enslaved to further one guy's career. I mean, if you wanted, could call Caesar a war
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:21.600]   criminal, and I think that wouldn't be unfair. But on the other hand, some people see him as
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:26.880]   a great hero. I mean, to talk about history and its reception, it's quite interesting to see how
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:32.880]   Caesar has been viewed by different generations. So at different points in time,
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:38.640]   the sort of received wisdom on Caesar is very different. So back in the, let's say,
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:43.840]   the 1920s or '30s, there were a number of scholarly things written, which kind of looked at Caesar as
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:51.280]   an admirable figure. He's a strong man who knows what Rome needed, and was going to give it to
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:56.480]   them. And of course, that's the era when fascism was kind of trendy, and was seen as a positive
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:01.440]   thing. And then you get Hitler in World War II, and all of a sudden, fascism's not so favored
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:06.000]   anymore. And then in that post-war generation, all of a sudden, Caesar's terrible. He's a
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:12.640]   dictator. He's destroying the republic. So often, histories that are written tell you a lot more
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:16.080]   about the time they're written than they do about the subject they're written about.
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:22.160]   Do we know, what did Hitler or Stalin think about the Roman Empire?
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:27.440]   I mean, certainly, they borrow a lot of the trappings. I mean, Nazi Germany borrows a lot
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:32.800]   of iconography from ancient Rome. I mean, they carried around little military standards with
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:37.920]   eagles on them, just like the Romans. But then everybody does that. I mean, the US has eagles
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:45.520]   as their standards. Mussolini had them. Napoleon had eagle standards for his military. So a lot
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:50.720]   of people like that imagery. You mentioned Cicero. He's a fascinating
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:58.800]   figure. On the topic of Roman oratory, who was Cicero? Cicero was a new man. So he's someone
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:05.120]   who didn't have famous ancestors. So he was at a disadvantage. And I think Cicero is really
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:10.640]   interesting for a couple of reasons. One is he wrote an incredible amount. I think we have almost
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:15.040]   more words from Cicero than any other author that survived. And it's all kinds of stuff. It's
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:21.200]   philosophical treatises. It's books about how to be a good public speaker. He published volume
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:26.400]   after volume of his personal letters to his friends. He published these things. So there's
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:32.240]   tons of stuff from him. And secondly, he's interesting because he lived at this incredibly
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:36.960]   important time in the late republic when things were falling apart. But he seems to have been
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:42.800]   born with none of the natural advantages that all these other people had. So he was a lousy general.
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:48.320]   He didn't come from a wealthy family. He didn't come from a famous aristocratic family.
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:54.480]   He didn't have a lot of these advantages. But yet, he ended up being right at the center of things,
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:04:00.160]   rose to the highest elected office in the Roman state on the basis of one skill. And that was
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:06.000]   his ability with words, his ability to get up in front of a crowd and persuade them of what he
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:12.160]   wanted them to believe. And oratory, public speaking, was absolutely central to life at Rome.
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:18.640]   There were just all these events where people had to get up and give speeches. So in courtrooms,
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:25.520]   at funerals, in the Senate, to the people of Rome, at games. I mean, just constantly,
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:30.560]   there are these opportunities for giving speeches. So if you were good at this, that was a huge
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:36.080]   advantage in your political career. And Cicero was the best. He was
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:40.880]   arguably the best public speaker of all time, some people claim.
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:47.040]   And he lived right in this era, and he parlayed that skill with words into this very successful
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:51.440]   political career. He was one of the guys involved with all this stuff with Caesar and Pompey and all
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:56.960]   the other things going on, Octavian, Marc Antony. >> And you've written, which is fascinating.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:04.240]   It's fascinating when the echoes of people from a distant past are seen today. The same stuff is
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:08.320]   seen today, not just like some of the beautiful legal stuff that we've been talking about,
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:16.720]   but the tricks, let's say the shitty stuff we see in politics. So many of the rhetorical tricks you
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:22.240]   wrote, such as mudslinging, exaggeration, guilt by association, ad hominem attacks, name calling,
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:27.200]   fear mongering, us versus them, rhyme, and so on and so forth. So I'm guessing it worked,
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:30.240]   given that we still have those today? >> Yeah, I mean, one of the things Cicero
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:35.360]   did is he wrote at least three of these sort of handbooks about how to be a good public speaker.
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:40.160]   So we know a lot about that. We have his own speeches that survive. And then we have later
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:43.680]   people after Cicero who wrote about what Cicero did too. So we know a lot about what he did.
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:51.760]   And the key to Cicero's whole enterprise about persuading an audience, let's say either in a
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:57.280]   speech to the people or in the courtroom, is Cicero believed that people are fundamentally
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:06:04.640]   ruled by emotion. So if you can touch their emotions, all sorts of other things become
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:11.600]   less important. If you can get a jury emotionally worked up and fear, anger are particularly
[02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:18.160]   powerful there, then the facts might not matter. The truth might not matter. Evidence might not
[02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:25.760]   matter. Reason might not matter. Emotion is the key to everything. So Cicero used what
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:32.160]   I would arguably call a lot of tricks to get his audiences emotionally riled up.
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:36.160]   And you can just go through these. And they're all the stuff you were saying, name calling,
[02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:45.600]   mudslinging, us versus them arguments, ad hominem attacks. I mean, incredibly sophisticated.
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:49.120]   All the stuff that we think of today is, oh, very sophisticated techniques for
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:56.000]   propaganda and persuasion. It's not new. People aren't coming up with that much that's new
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.040]   outside the realm of technology. Human nature is the same. Cicero understood human psychology. He
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:06.320]   knew how to play on people. He knew how to play on their emotions. And he would do just, I mean,
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:11.680]   I want to say hilarious, but they're sort of depressingly hilarious things. Like he thought
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:17.520]   it's important to use props. So he said, people are visual. They will respond emotionally to
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:23.280]   visual things in a way that just words alone won't work. So he says, in order is just like
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:32.400]   an actor. And like an actor, he has to prepare his stage and use props and things as visual cues to
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:37.760]   stir up the audience. So for example, once he was defending a man in a court case who had just had
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:43.680]   a new baby born to him, and Cicero literally delivered the defense oration for this guy
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:49.200]   while cradling his newborn son in his arms. And you can imagine, oh, cute little baby. Jury,
[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:53.680]   how could you find him guilty and leave this cute baby without a father to take care of him?
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:59.840]   Another time, he was defending a guy who had a photogenic son, a kind of a young boy. And Cicero
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:04.800]   literally propped up the kid behind him while he was giving the speech and again said, look at his
[02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:09.680]   eyes brimming with tears, thinking about his father being punished. How could you leave this
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:15.120]   wonderful boy without a father to care for him? Another time, someone didn't have photogenic kids,
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:19.920]   so he propped up his old parents in the courtroom and said, look at this nice old couple. You won't
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:26.560]   want to take their son away. That kind of stuff. I mean, it's manipulative. Cicero, by the way,
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:31.360]   should say also had philosophical beliefs about defending the republic and such,
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:37.840]   but he wasn't above using these things. So even though he may have had altruistic or high notions
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:43.200]   of what he was doing, he also wasn't above using these kind of rhetorical tricks.
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:46.240]   And also you mentioned to me that you studied the gestures
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:55.440]   they used. This is one of those on the theme of extremely interesting details of life.
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:59.760]   This was actually my dissertation, and it was my first book as well.
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:00.960]   That's amazing. That's amazing.
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:06.000]   Again, I tell you, I like practical stuff. And this all started with, I kept reading about people
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:11.600]   like Cicero giving speeches in ancient Rome, lots of speeches. And they would give a speech in the
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:16.720]   forum with 10, 20,000 people. And the thought occurred to me, well, in ancient Rome, you don't
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:23.440]   have microphones, you don't have loudspeakers. So how does someone give a speech outdoors in a windy
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:28.400]   place, not acoustically sound to 20,000 people? They just can't hear you.
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:33.280]   And the answer, part of the answer turns out, well, part of it's oratorical training. You learn
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:38.400]   how to project your voice. But some of it too is that the Romans actually had this system of
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:44.640]   gestures that orators like Cicero would use to accompany their speeches. And what I ended up
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:50.800]   doing is combining two types of evidence again. So I looked at the rhetorical handbooks like
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:55.760]   Cicero's, and also there's this guy Quintilian, who lived about 100 years after Cicero,
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:01.360]   who wrote this long thing called the Institutio Oratoria, which has a description of all types
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:06.240]   of oratorical stuff, including about 40 pages on gestures. So he actually says, "When you put your
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:11.840]   fingers like this, it means such and such." And it turns out Roman orators had a system of sign
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:17.440]   language that they would use to augment their speeches. But here's the fun part. It wasn't
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:23.920]   like modern American sign language, where a gesture means the same thing as a word. Instead,
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:30.240]   and this goes back to Cicero, a certain gesture would indicate a certain emotion that you were
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:38.000]   meant to feel when you heard the words. So it's like your body is adding an emotional gloss to
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.880]   your speech. You're saying words, and then you're indicating how you think those words should make
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:49.600]   you feel. And even more fun, the Romans believed that if I make certain hand gestures, you will
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:56.320]   almost involuntarily feel certain emotions. So if you're skilled, you can manipulate your audience
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:01.920]   by playing on their emotions. And this might sound kind of weird or improbable, but the metaphor that
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:07.440]   Cicero himself uses is he says, "Think about music. Everybody knows that certain musical tones
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:12.880]   will make you feel a certain way." So think of movies today. In a horror movie, they're going
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:17.680]   to play strident, tense music. In a romantic scene, you're going to have strings, and it'll
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:23.280]   make you feel a certain way. When you hear the Jaws theme, you feel tense, right? Cicero said,
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:28.720]   "The orator's body is like a lyre. A lyre is a musical instrument, and you have to learn to play
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:33.360]   on your own body as a musical instrument to affect the emotions of your audience."
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:38.320]   I think he might be onto something, especially given how central public speaking was in Roman
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:38.560]   culture.
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:43.120]   And a lot of the Roman oratorical gestures, I could probably do some, and you could probably
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:48.320]   guess what emotion they're meant to be. So for example, there's one where you hold up your hands
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:54.160]   to the side and kind of push like this. So this is the gesture, and what that means is kind of
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:12:00.080]   mild aversion. I don't like something. Now, if I couple this with turning my face to the side,
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:04.800]   that, so pushing off to one side, turning my face away, it's a strong aversion. That's like
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:10.560]   veer or something. If I clench my fist and press it to my chest, that's anger or grief.
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:16.320]   If I slap my thigh, again, that's an indication of anger. So a lot of these make sense. I mean,
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:21.600]   they're kind of natural gestures. Now, some are really weird and artificial. I mean, one of my
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:26.960]   favorite of these is if you like hold your hand up open and then curl the fingers in one by one
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:35.360]   and then flip it out. So this sort of thing, that to the Romans meant wonder, which you sort of see.
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:40.800]   But again, if you've been raised in a societal context where you're used to the notion that
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:46.080]   this gesture means this emotion, when someone does it, you're probably gonna feel that emotion.
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:48.720]   It's like memes today. If it becomes viral, it's...
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:51.280]   You know what it's supposed to mean and has that effect.
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:52.240]   It percolates through the culture and has power. I mean,
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:57.840]   and it's actually interesting that we don't use gestures as much in modern day.
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:02.320]   Well, I mean, for me, I just love analyzing modern political figures in terms of their
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:08.960]   body language. Because how you deliver a speech is often more important than what you say.
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:15.120]   In fact, in the ancient world, the most famous Greek orator was a guy named Demosthenes.
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:20.240]   And once a guy came up to Demosthenes and said, "Demosthenes, tell me, what are the three most
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:26.400]   important things in giving a speech?" And Demosthenes said, "Well, they are delivery,
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:33.280]   delivery, and delivery." That even the most brilliant speech, if accompanied by a boring
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:39.760]   delivery, is gonna be less effective than a terrible speech given in an engaging and exciting
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:43.440]   or funny way. Speaking of modern day and gestures, what do you think of
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:50.640]   Donald Trump, who has these very unique kind of gestures? I think there's, I don't know to
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:54.480]   degree to it's true, but he kind of uses these handshakes when he pulls people in, that kind of
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:14:01.520]   stuff. What do you make of that? I mean, Trump gesticulates a lot, but it's a fairly narrow set
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:07.120]   of gestures. I mean, if you watch him for a bit, he kind of has the same small set of gestures.
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:12.480]   And they're not, honestly, they're not natural in that they're not kind of illustrating what
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:17.680]   he's saying, it's more just punctuation points. I think of his as more kind of these punctuation
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:23.280]   points for just going along with what he's saying. There are speakers who truly can use their
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:30.400]   hands and arms and faces creatively, and you watch them and it's really enhancing the speech.
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:35.040]   I mean, just historically, you know, Martin Luther King, he's famous for a lot of good
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:41.760]   speeches content, he was a good gesticulator too. He knew how to use his body. On the other hand,
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:47.440]   Adolf Hitler was a phenomenal gesticulator. If you watch some of his speeches, even just like
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:52.640]   turn off the sound and watch them, he's doing all kinds of stuff and he's really emphasizing
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:58.880]   his points in a very creative way. And this is what's fascinating about oratory and public
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:04.640]   speaking is it's this two-edged sword. You can use these techniques for good, or you can
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:12.800]   absolutely use them for evil. So, the very same techniques in the hands of MLK, you say,
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:17.360]   "This is wonderful, this is fantastic." In the hands of Hitler, you say, "This is awful." Look,
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:23.040]   he's persuading a nation to commit atrocities. I encourage people to watch the speeches of Hitler,
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:30.640]   the oratory skill there, to be able to channel the resentment and the frustration
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:40.960]   of a people and control it and direct it to any direction he wants through speaking alone.
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:46.000]   Yeah, it's the visual embodiment of the words where he's talking about Weimar Germany being
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.800]   taken advantage of supposedly and all this stuff. You're right, he's channeling the resentment
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:58.080]   of the people and using that to his personal advantage and for cynical evil really purposes.
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:04.080]   But oratory is like that. The question I always end up asking my students is
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:08.720]   after studying Cicero and all these techniques, I say, "Okay, this is great oratory,
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:12.880]   but do you like this? Is this good that this works on human beings?"
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:18.880]   I remember Noam Chomsky once was asked, "Why do you speak in such a monotone way?" And he said,
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:23.600]   "Well, I want the truth of my statement, the contents of my statements to speak
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:30.240]   that I don't want you to get deluded by me because I'm such a charismatic and eloquent speaker.
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:34.400]   The more monotone I speak, the more you will listen to the content of the words."
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:39.600]   I want you just focusing on the content and not being distracted. I'll tell you also with Cicero,
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:44.720]   one of the things that he and other people who write about Roman oratory do is to say,
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:50.720]   "And you can do this stuff badly," in which case it backfires horribly. So you can have people who
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:54.960]   attempt to gesticulate. Again, modern politicians, you'll see this sometime where they feel like,
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:00.320]   "I'm supposed to be making hand gestures," and they're terrible at it, and it undercuts it.
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:05.120]   And Cicero and Quintilian give some very amusing examples from ancient Rome. So like he says,
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:10.000]   there was this one guy who when he spoke looked like he was trying to swat away flies because
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.480]   there were just these awkward gestures, or another who looked like he was trying to balance in a boat
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:20.880]   like in choppy seas. And my favorite is there was one order who supposedly was prone to making,
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:28.560]   I guess, kind of languid, supple motions. And so they actually named a dance after this guy,
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:34.400]   and his name was Tidius. And so Romans could do the Tidius, which is this dance that was
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:41.600]   imitating this order who had these kind of comically bad gesticulation. So not enough
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:47.280]   gesticulation is a problem. Too much gesticulation is a problem. You have to hit the sweet spot.
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:53.040]   It has to seem natural. It has to seem varied. It has to conform to the meaning of the words,
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:55.280]   not distract from it. >> Yeah, natural to your,
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:18:00.720]   like authentic to who you are, which is when people try to copy the gestures of another person,
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:06.640]   it usually doesn't go well. You have to interpret, integrate into your own personality and so on.
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:09.120]   >> But gestures is a really fun- >> It's fascinating.
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:14.800]   >> I enjoyed my dissertation a lot doing that, because what I was trying to do there was to
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:19.280]   literally reconstruct them, so to say, what were the actual gestures? And I did that by comparing
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:24.320]   the literary accounts of the handbooks with, again, Roman art, looking at statues of Romans
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:28.240]   and things, and just trying to say, okay, what were some of the gestures they actually used here?
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:34.240]   >> And in that way, the people from that time come to life in your mind and your work,
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:35.760]   which is fascinating. >> Someone gets this
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:37.600]   pragmatic thing. I want to know, okay, how does this work?
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:47.760]   >> Could we talk about the role of religion in the Roman Empire? What's the story there?
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:57.920]   >> I mean, religion's interesting, because in my mind, the rise to dominance in a lot of the world
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:03.600]   of monotheistic religions is one of the huge sort of turning points, because it's just such a
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:09.600]   different mentality. I mean, it's very, very different where you say, there's one god and
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:15.680]   it's my god versus, okay, I believe in this god, but there's an infinite number of legitimate gods.
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:22.560]   And nowadays, particularly in the West, we tend to view the monotheistic perspective as the norm,
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:30.960]   but for more than half of human history, it was not. It used to be the notion in a lot of Roman
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:37.760]   history up until about 300 AD, the idea was, well, there's just a ton of gods floating around,
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:42.400]   and maybe you worship that one, and I worship these two that I like, and the guy across the
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:47.840]   street worships the oak tree in his backyard, and it's all good. They're all legitimate things
[02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:54.080]   versus, oh, no, no, no, now there is one god and only one god that's the correct answer.
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:20:00.320]   And as soon as you do that, religion becomes foregrounded in your decision-making much more.
[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:04.320]   I mean, the Romans had religion, but it wasn't really driving anything,
[02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:08.720]   if you know what I mean. It was auxiliary to things rather than a central force.
[02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:16.480]   So for a lot of Roman history, you had a standard kind of, I guess, pagan polytheism where
[02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:19.920]   there's a bunch of gods, there's certain gods who are associated with the Roman state,
[02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:28.080]   and there would be prayer said to those gods on behalf of the Roman state, but it wasn't really,
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:33.920]   you weren't trying to execute the will of Zeus or something or Jupiter or Mars or anybody else.
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:38.880]   And in your private life, it was the same thing. You might ask certain gods for help, but it wasn't
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:45.440]   as much of a dominant thing in your own existence. So I think that's a real transition point where
[02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:51.200]   religion started to become so foregrounded. And as soon as you get the monotheistic religions,
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:56.240]   Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in particular, it really shifts how people start to think about
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:58.560]   themselves in relationship to the world around them.
[02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:03.600]   So Jesus was born during the rule of Emperor Augustus.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:08.320]   Yep. Which is kind of neat that really influential people in the realm of
[02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:13.360]   political events and religious events coexisted. What are the odds?
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:18.480]   I mean, yeah, there's certain moments in history where just a lot of interesting,
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:25.200]   powerful people come together and make history. And he was crucified under Emperor Tiberius rule.
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:25.700]   Yep.
[02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:30.980]   Why were the ideas of Jesus seen as a threat by the Emperor?
[02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:40.740]   The thing that causes conflicts between the Romans and Christians is a little bit strange. It's all
[02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:48.180]   with this where the Romans had a tradition of on the Emperor's birthday, sort of saying a prayer,
[02:21:48.180 --> 02:21:53.540]   basically wishing him good luck, okay? But technically, it's in the form of sacrificing
[02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:56.900]   to that part of the Emperor that might become divine after his death.
[02:21:56.900 --> 02:22:02.020]   So to the Romans, this is the equivalent of a patriotism act,
[02:22:02.020 --> 02:22:06.100]   saying the Pledge of Allegiance or something to the country. But of course, to Christians,
[02:22:06.100 --> 02:22:11.060]   this is worshiping another god. And I think there's almost a failure of communication here,
[02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:15.940]   that the Romans just, at least initially, didn't quite understand this is really problematic for
[02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:20.180]   these people because they're coming from a polytheistic perspective where, yeah,
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:26.580]   everybody has different gods, so what? This isn't a religious problem. This is a political one,
[02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:31.940]   that why won't you send good wishes to the Emperor? If you're a loyal Roman, this is something you
[02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:36.500]   should want to do. And many of the early Christians, I think, would have been fine with
[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:43.380]   that. But it took the form of what they were asked to do was to basically worship another god.
[02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:50.020]   And that was the sticking point. And this is where I think movies have kind of warped some of our
[02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:56.660]   images of Roman history, that Hollywood loves to depict very early Christians, and I'm talking
[02:22:56.660 --> 02:23:04.100]   like first 200 years here after the ministry of Christ, as a group that all the Romans were
[02:23:04.100 --> 02:23:08.660]   obsessed with, that they were constantly trying to persecute and all this. And honestly, I think
[02:23:08.660 --> 02:23:12.900]   the Romans at that point were more just sort of indifferent or didn't know what was going on.
[02:23:12.900 --> 02:23:17.540]   And if you look at some of the primary sources that time, I mean, there's this very famous
[02:23:17.540 --> 02:23:24.660]   letter by a guy named Pliny, who was a Roman governor of a province in the east. And he has
[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:28.900]   the habit of writing letters to the Roman Emperor at the time, who was Trajan, every time he had a
[02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:35.380]   problem with being governor. And so this is great. This is the two highest governmental officials in
[02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:39.620]   the Roman world, sort of hammering out policy between them, right? The Emperor and one of his
[02:23:39.620 --> 02:23:47.060]   governors. And so this is about 100 years, 100 AD about, and Pliny says, "Hey, Emperor, I had this
[02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:51.300]   issue. I had these people come before me called Christians. I don't quite know what to do with
[02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:56.100]   them. What should my policy be? And here's what I know about them." And what he knows is almost
[02:23:56.100 --> 02:24:01.300]   nothing. I mean, it's this almost comic-like garbling, and they have this weird thing where
[02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:06.100]   they get together on some day of the week, and they sort of swear oaths to one another not to
[02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:12.180]   do bad stuff, which is, of course, his garbled understanding of the Ten Commandments. And then
[02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:17.220]   they have breakfast together, and they eat food, and this is communion, but he doesn't get that
[02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:23.300]   that's what's going on. And so he's really ignorant. But I think that the broader point is,
[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:30.500]   okay, this is one of the best-educated, best-traveled Romans who has the most experience
[02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:35.220]   in the empire, has been all over the empire. And what does he know about Christianity?
[02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:43.140]   Basically nothing. So if one of the best-educated, most widely-traveled guys really doesn't know much
[02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:48.020]   about them, that kind of suggests that not many people did at this point in time.
[02:24:48.020 --> 02:24:50.340]   >> At this time, it was a fringe movement that really did...
[02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:54.820]   >> Yeah, very fringe. I mean, it was one of hundreds of little mystery religions,
[02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:58.740]   the Romans sort of thought on this. And these are religions that have some sort of revealed
[02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:04.660]   knowledge and that appeals, make more personal appeals to people. Now, stepping back from this
[02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:10.340]   in a broad way, I think you can say that Christianity really was different in some ways
[02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:15.860]   and had some things that maybe the Romans should rightfully viewed as a threat. I mean, the Romans
[02:25:15.860 --> 02:25:21.540]   are people very focused on this world, right? Citizenship, what you do. Christianity in essence
[02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:26.660]   has a focus on the next world. So this world isn't as important as what you're setting yourself up
[02:25:26.660 --> 02:25:31.620]   for. And even worse from a Roman perspective, I'm kind of saying, okay, if I were a Roman,
[02:25:32.340 --> 02:25:40.340]   Romans are all about making distinctions between people, citizen, non-citizen, man, woman, free,
[02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:48.020]   slave. Christianity comes along and says, in God's eyes, you're all equal. Now, that's a pretty
[02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:55.860]   problematic idea if you're deeply invested in Roman hierarchy. And I think it is no surprise
[02:25:55.860 --> 02:26:03.940]   that among the earliest converts to Christianity are women and slaves, and in particular,
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:10.260]   female slaves. Now, who are they? They're the people at the rock bottom of the Roman hierarchy
[02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:14.900]   of status, right? Which the Romans are obsessed with status, but here's a religion that says
[02:26:14.900 --> 02:26:20.260]   that doesn't matter. And in that same letter to Pliny, Pliny says, okay, and this group of
[02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:26.100]   Christians I've heard about, their leaders are two female slaves they call deaconesses. Now,
[02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:32.420]   this is really early. This is before the church exists, right? There's no church structure yet.
[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:39.940]   And who is leading the local congregation of Christians? Two slave women. So that's an
[02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:46.180]   interesting moment. And that's not necessarily the image we get of early Christianity, but you can
[02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:52.260]   see how for people in this social structure, that would be very appealing to them. And in some ways,
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:56.420]   yeah, it is sort of a threat to the Roman system because they're challenging it. Now,
[02:26:56.420 --> 02:27:03.700]   the irony is, of course, 300 years after the life of Christ, the emperor converts to Christianity,
[02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:08.340]   and another 100 years later under Theodosius, it becomes the official religion of the Roman
[02:27:08.340 --> 02:27:14.340]   empire. So all of a sudden, you have this flip-flop where now the state itself is not just
[02:27:14.340 --> 02:27:19.860]   converted to Christianity, but actively promoting it and now persecuting pagans.
[02:27:19.860 --> 02:27:27.060]   And the reason the emperors do that is one of the biggest problems for emperors at that point
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:32.500]   in time is legitimacy, that there's tons of civil wars where you have lots of different people
[02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:38.580]   saying, "I'm emperor." So lots of generals declaring themselves emperor. Now, under a
[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:46.980]   polytheistic religion, you're all just fighting, it doesn't matter. But if you say, "There is only
[02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:55.940]   one God," then if that God picks someone to be his emperor, they're the only legitimate emperor,
[02:27:55.940 --> 02:28:02.660]   right? So there is a real advantage to emperors now becoming Christian, because if they can say,
[02:28:03.860 --> 02:28:09.380]   "We're now a Christian empire, and there's only one God, and I'm the guy that God picked to be
[02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:13.460]   emperor," that means all these other people claiming to be emperors are illegitimate.
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:19.620]   >> Do you think that, or is there other factors that explain why Christianity was able to spread?
[02:28:19.620 --> 02:28:23.540]   >> Well, I mean, that's why it's appealing to the emperors. And we're talking here,
[02:28:23.540 --> 02:28:29.780]   I mean, the religious answer is people see the light, right? It's a faith-based thing.
[02:28:29.780 --> 02:28:34.980]   I'm looking at this as a historian. So putting aside religious feeling and saying, "Okay,
[02:28:34.980 --> 02:28:40.180]   if I'm doing an analysis of this as a social phenomenon, what would be appealing to people?"
[02:28:40.180 --> 02:28:45.380]   And there is that very compelling reason for emperors to want to go to Christianity, because
[02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:50.260]   it helps them with their biggest problem, which is legitimacy. Now, if you're an ordinary person,
[02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:54.100]   what is the appeal of Christianity? Well, we already looked at a couple of them.
[02:28:54.100 --> 02:29:00.420]   One of them is that it promises you a reward in the afterlife. I mean, the Roman and Greek notions
[02:29:00.420 --> 02:29:05.540]   of the afterlife aren't that appealing. Either you just sort of turn into dust, or at best,
[02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:09.300]   you turn into this kind of ghost thing that floats around something that looks like a
[02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:15.220]   Greek gymnasium, which is like a bunch of grassy fields. It's not so hot. So here,
[02:29:15.220 --> 02:29:19.380]   you're offered the idea of like, "Oh, you go to paradise forever. That sounds really good."
[02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:24.420]   And secondly, for a lot of people in Roman society, that notion of, "Here's something that
[02:29:24.420 --> 02:29:29.300]   says I'm valuable as a human being. It doesn't matter whether I'm free or slave. It doesn't
[02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:33.860]   matter whether I'm Roman or non-Roman. It doesn't matter if I'm a man or woman. Here's something
[02:29:33.860 --> 02:29:38.660]   that says I have equal value." That's enormously appealing. And finally, early Christians, I mean,
[02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:44.020]   they honestly, a lot of them do good works. They take care of the sick. They feed the poor. I mean,
[02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:49.140]   if you look at Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, that's the stuff he really hammers. If we look at
[02:29:49.140 --> 02:29:52.260]   the words of Jesus when he says, "What do you do to be a Christian?" a lot of it is,
[02:29:52.260 --> 02:29:58.660]   "Take care of the unfortunate. Take care of people who are sick. Take care of people who
[02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:03.380]   are starving." And a lot of the early Christians really take that seriously.
[02:30:03.380 --> 02:30:06.660]   So they are helping people out. So that's appealing.
[02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:11.620]   They're the good kind of populist and populist messages spread.
[02:30:11.620 --> 02:30:16.260]   Let me ask you about gladiators.
[02:30:16.260 --> 02:30:18.180]   I switched your pace here.
[02:30:18.180 --> 02:30:22.420]   What role did they play in Roman society?
[02:30:22.420 --> 02:30:28.180]   I mean, okay, gladiator games obviously become a popular form of entertainment,
[02:30:28.180 --> 02:30:32.180]   and they're one of the ones that's captured people's imaginations for all sorts of reasons.
[02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:37.140]   I mean, it's dramatic, but also I think it's that apparent contradiction that in so many ways,
[02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:43.780]   Roman society seems familiar to us. In so many ways, it seems sophisticated and appealing.
[02:30:44.580 --> 02:30:50.660]   Law is wonderful, all this, but yet for fun, they watched people fight to the death.
[02:30:50.660 --> 02:30:56.420]   So how do you reconcile these things? Gladiators I find very interesting because
[02:30:56.420 --> 02:31:04.580]   they're an example of what historians call status dissonance. So it's someone who in society
[02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:11.460]   has high status in some ways and very low or despised status in another.
[02:31:12.020 --> 02:31:18.500]   So gladiators, most of them were slaves, the lowest of the low in Roman society, right?
[02:31:18.500 --> 02:31:25.300]   Also, they're fighting for other people's pleasure and dying sometimes for other people's pleasure.
[02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:29.940]   And the Romans had a real thing about this, like your body being used for other's pleasure.
[02:31:29.940 --> 02:31:35.940]   Even a humble working person who hired themselves out for labor, the Romans thought that was
[02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:41.380]   innately demeaning because you're using your body for someone else's benefit or pleasure.
[02:31:41.380 --> 02:31:46.420]   So they didn't have this notion of the dignity of hard labor or something. They thought the
[02:31:46.420 --> 02:31:51.220]   only noble profession was farming, okay? Because there you generate something and you're producing
[02:31:51.220 --> 02:31:56.180]   it for yourself. But if you work for someone else, you're demeaning yourself. And gladiators are the
[02:31:56.180 --> 02:32:00.660]   worst of the worst, right? You're performing for someone else's pleasure. So on the one hand,
[02:32:00.660 --> 02:32:06.900]   they're very low status. But on the other hand, successful gladiators get famous. People admire
[02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:14.900]   them. Women find them attractive. They're celebrities. And so this is the status dissonance,
[02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:20.580]   right? You have these people who on the one hand, formally are very low status in society,
[02:32:20.580 --> 02:32:25.860]   but yet are very popular on the other hand. Another kind of myth about gladiators is that
[02:32:25.860 --> 02:32:30.900]   they were just dying all the time. I mean, you watch movies and again, they'll always
[02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:35.620]   throw a bunch of gladiators and they all die. I think some scholar did a study of there's like
[02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:42.660]   a hundred fights we know of where we know some details. And I think 10% of those ended in the
[02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:49.380]   death of one of the people. So gladiators are a lot more like boxing matches, where you're
[02:32:49.380 --> 02:32:55.140]   watching a display of skill between two people who are more or less evenly matched in terms of
[02:32:55.140 --> 02:33:00.180]   their abilities. And probably they'll survive, though there's a chance that one of them might
[02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:08.260]   get injured. In fact, one might die. Having said all that, in the end, you really are having people
[02:33:08.260 --> 02:33:13.220]   fight and potentially die for the pleasure of an audience. And anthropologists and Roman
[02:33:13.220 --> 02:33:20.100]   historians like to speculate why did the Romans do this? The Romans address it. I mean, there's a
[02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:26.820]   famous thing where a Roman says, "We Romans were a violent people. We're a warlike people. And so
[02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:32.580]   it's fitting that we should be accustomed to the sight of death and violence." Kind of works.
[02:33:32.580 --> 02:33:40.980]   There's a more symbolic interpretation that says the amphitheater is an expression of Roman
[02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:46.580]   dominance, a symbolic expression. Because what you have are all segments of Roman society gathered
[02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:53.460]   together to control the fate of others. So you have foreigners, you have wild animals, you have
[02:33:53.460 --> 02:34:00.340]   criminals, you have other people. And we are symbolically asserting our dominance over those
[02:34:00.340 --> 02:34:07.220]   groups by determining do you live or do you die? And that kind of works too. And the cynical one
[02:34:07.220 --> 02:34:13.300]   is humans like violence. I mean, when people watch a hockey game, what gets the most excited?
[02:34:13.300 --> 02:34:19.300]   The fight. When people watch car racing, there's a crash. What's gonna be shown on the news? It's
[02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:25.140]   the crash. So there's something dark in human nature sometimes that likes violence. And maybe
[02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:30.820]   the Romans are just being more honest about it than we are. I think Dan Carlin has a really
[02:34:30.820 --> 02:34:38.420]   great episode called Painful Tainment. And I think in that episode, he suggests the hypothetical that
[02:34:38.420 --> 02:34:43.700]   if we did something like a gladiator games today to the death, that like the whole world would tune
[02:34:43.700 --> 02:34:50.900]   in. Especially if it was anonymous, right? We have a kind of like thin veil of civility
[02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:54.820]   underneath which we probably would still be something deep within us would be attracted
[02:34:54.820 --> 02:34:56.420]   to that violence. Yeah?
[02:34:56.420 --> 02:35:02.260]   >> I mean, yeah, there always is it human nature? Why do people slow down when there's a car wreck
[02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:06.820]   and try and see what's happening? On the other hand, to be fair, I mean, there were Romans at
[02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:13.060]   the time who morally objected to them and said this is morally degenerate to take pleasure in
[02:35:13.060 --> 02:35:18.580]   this and that's wrong. So I think in all eras, you have a diversity of opinions. There's no
[02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:22.020]   unanimous take on what this is or what this means.
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:26.100]   >> So who usually wore the gladiators? Was it slaves? Was it-
[02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:31.380]   >> Well, the most common source, again, is prisoners of war. So if you conquer some people
[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:36.580]   and they seem to be warlike, you might well consign some of them to fight in the arena.
[02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:42.740]   And the other thing about gladiators is they were highly trained professionals. So the
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:47.620]   gladiator schools who trained them were spending a lot of money to train these people. And it
[02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:52.340]   wasn't just we take some guy and throw him into the arena like you see in movies all the time.
[02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:56.900]   These were people that you'd invested a lot of money and that's why you don't really want to
[02:35:56.900 --> 02:36:03.220]   see them killed. But yeah, mostly they're prisoners of war. I mean, in very rare instances,
[02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:08.660]   you might have a free person volunteering or even selling themselves to fight as gladiators, but
[02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:15.140]   much more common was that. And what's interesting is some people wouldn't do it. I mean, there's a
[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:19.860]   lot of instances of gladiators refusing to fight and committing suicide, which you don't hear.
[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:26.340]   So there was one German who was supposed to fight as a gladiator, and instead he stuck his head
[02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:31.700]   between the spokes of a wagon that was spinning and snapped his own neck. There were a group of
[02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:36.100]   29 Germans who all sort of said, "We're not going to fight for the Romans' pleasure," and they
[02:36:36.100 --> 02:36:41.540]   strangled one another the night before they were supposed to fight. So I mean, you have people
[02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:46.580]   sort of objecting to being complicit in this kind of performance as well.
[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:50.260]   And they also had interest in animals.
[02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:50.820]   Yes.
[02:36:50.820 --> 02:36:54.340]   So humans fought animals, exotic animals.
[02:36:54.340 --> 02:36:58.820]   And animals fought animals. Yeah, the Romans were a little weird with their animal thing.
[02:36:58.820 --> 02:37:04.900]   They loved exotic animals, but mostly they like to see the exotic animals die. So I mean,
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:11.060]   there was an enormous industry collecting wild beasts, transporting them to Rome,
[02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:17.780]   which is no easy matter to transport elephants and giraffes and rhinos, particularly in this era
[02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:24.420]   of technology. But they were draining Africa and bringing lions and all these things and sacrificing
[02:37:24.420 --> 02:37:25.060]   them.
[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:28.260]   And what about the different venues? I mean, there's the legendary Colosseum.
[02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:31.300]   What is the importance of this place?
[02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:37.780]   Well, the Colosseum's real name is the Flavian Amphitheater. It's interesting because for a long
[02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:42.980]   time, Rome always had a chariot racing arena, the Circus Maximus, but it didn't have a permanent
[02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:50.020]   gladiatorial venue until relatively late, till about 80 AD. So during the reign of the Emperor
[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:56.420]   Vespasian. And he built this thing. So he built the Flavian Amphitheater. He was from the Flavian
[02:37:56.420 --> 02:38:05.220]   family of emperors. And he did it as a deliberate act of propaganda. So before him had been Nero,
[02:38:05.220 --> 02:38:13.140]   who was sort of seen as a crazy or bad emperor. And one of Nero's indulgences is he had built this
[02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:18.660]   enormous palace for himself called the Golden House. So it was kind of this pleasure palace
[02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:24.580]   with 50 dining rooms and all this stuff. And it was basically wasting a ton of money on him, right?
[02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:32.100]   So right on the site where Nero had his Golden House, Vespasian says, "I'm going to erect a new
[02:38:32.100 --> 02:38:36.740]   building on top of it that's going to be for the pleasure of the people." So it was very much a
[02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:42.580]   political statement that my dynasty is going to be about serving Romans, not serving ourselves.
[02:38:42.580 --> 02:38:48.740]   And so that's why he builds the Flavian Amphitheater. And the funds he uses from it is
[02:38:48.740 --> 02:38:53.540]   basically from looting Jerusalem. Because the other thing he had done just before this is he
[02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:59.940]   had sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the temple there, in fact. He and his son Titus. And so
[02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:04.740]   this is what he now builds in Rome as his gift to the people of Rome.
[02:39:04.740 --> 02:39:09.460]   But it's interesting to think about that place, to think about their relationship with violence
[02:39:09.460 --> 02:39:18.100]   across centuries for spectacle, watching people fight. And like you said, only like 10% of the
[02:39:18.100 --> 02:39:26.180]   time, it led to the death. But I read that still a lot of people died. A lot of gladiators were
[02:39:26.180 --> 02:39:33.540]   killed. There's numbers that are just crazy. I mean, I read 400,000 dead. So this includes
[02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:38.820]   gladiators, slaves, convicts, prisoners, and so on. That's a lot of people.
[02:39:38.820 --> 02:39:43.380]   >> The Flavian Amphitheater is really interesting too, just as a piece of technology and as
[02:39:43.380 --> 02:39:49.620]   influence on later world. I mean, almost every sporting arena today owes something to the Flavian
[02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:55.140]   Amphitheater Coliseum in terms of construction. And it was amazingly sophisticated building. I
[02:39:55.140 --> 02:40:00.900]   mean, it had retractable awnings, and elevators, and ramps that things could just pop up into the
[02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:07.860]   arena from below. And it had very well-designed passages where everybody could file in and file
[02:40:07.860 --> 02:40:12.260]   out very efficiently, and they were all numbered. So I mean, it's one of, I think, the most
[02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:18.180]   influential buildings in history just because of the way that all these buildings we go to today,
[02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:21.540]   they're all kind of variants on it and using some of the ideas from it.
[02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:25.060]   >> And the Romans took their construction seriously.
[02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:30.180]   >> Oh, yeah, they were good at that. So they were excellent engineers. And the Romans were
[02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:34.660]   excellent engineers, especially when it came to what you might think of as humble stuff. I mean,
[02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:39.460]   today we tend to think of, oh, a Roman building is shining white marble, right? Well, the core
[02:40:39.460 --> 02:40:44.500]   of that building was probably concrete, and the marble is just a superficial facade. And if you
[02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:49.300]   think about the Coliseum in Rome today, all the marble has been stripped off that building. And
[02:40:49.300 --> 02:40:54.660]   what you see is the concrete core, the structural core that's left. And the Romans, I mean, they
[02:40:54.660 --> 02:41:00.020]   didn't invent concrete, but they just used it more creatively than anyone had before.
[02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:03.700]   And if you look at buildings like the Greeks built, they're all rectilinear. They're all
[02:41:03.700 --> 02:41:08.820]   rectangles or squares, and they always have a lot of columns because you need to hold the roof up.
[02:41:09.380 --> 02:41:15.060]   The Romans, because of their use of concrete, could build wooden frames. They could have curves,
[02:41:15.060 --> 02:41:19.620]   they could have domes, they could have all kinds of stuff. And it just explodes the
[02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:25.780]   architectural possibilities. They also made a lot of use of the vault. So if you cut rocks and
[02:41:25.780 --> 02:41:30.820]   arrange them so they form a curve, you could have big vaulted spaces. And they were just brilliant
[02:41:30.820 --> 02:41:35.300]   with their mix of things. I mean, the Pantheon is the best preserved Roman building, and it's
[02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:41.060]   another brilliant building, incredibly influential. I mean, every capital building in the world or
[02:41:41.060 --> 02:41:47.460]   museum is an imitation of the Pantheon. The Capitol in Washington, DC, the Capitol in Madison,
[02:41:47.460 --> 02:41:53.140]   where I'm from, Wisconsin, Austin, where we are now, they're all Pantheons. It's a big dome with
[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:58.660]   a triangular pediment and some columns on the front. So it's just an amazingly influential
[02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:03.860]   building, but it's brilliant because the way it's constructed is the concrete at the bottom of the
[02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:10.260]   dome is both thicker and has a denser formulation. So it's heavier where it needs to bear the weight.
[02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:14.900]   And then as you get further up the dome, it gets narrower and narrower, and they mix in different
[02:42:14.900 --> 02:42:20.660]   types of rock. So at the top, you're using pumice, that very light volcanic stone. So where you want
[02:42:20.660 --> 02:42:25.300]   it to be light, it's light. And it's here 2,000 years later. I mean, look around you. How many
[02:42:25.300 --> 02:42:30.340]   buildings that we're building now do you think are going to be here in 2,000 years? I suspect
[02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:35.380]   not many. >> And it's not only that they lasted, but they were beautiful, or at least in our
[02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:40.820]   current conception of beauty. >> Yeah. I mean, Vitruvius, his principles are things should be
[02:42:40.820 --> 02:42:45.460]   functional and they should be aesthetically pleasing. So that's a winning combination,
[02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:50.180]   I think. >> Yeah, they pulled that off pretty well. If we could talk about the long line of
[02:42:50.180 --> 02:42:57.620]   emperors that made up the Roman Empire, how were they selected? >> Oh, boy. We've been talking
[02:42:57.620 --> 02:43:03.780]   about Augustus' great achievements and how clever he was with propaganda and all. This is his great
[02:43:03.780 --> 02:43:10.580]   failure. So his great failure is that he did not solve was the problem of succession. How do you
[02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:16.260]   ensure that the next person who follows you is not just the best person, but is qualified?
[02:43:16.260 --> 02:43:23.780]   And he fails to do it. So the principle he settles on is heredity, so the nearest blood relative.
[02:43:23.780 --> 02:43:27.780]   And he goes through all these people. All these young kids in his family die. He keeps trying to
[02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:33.220]   make the heir. And he ends up making his heir Tiberius, who he never liked. It was his stepson.
[02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:38.980]   He didn't like him, but he ends up inheriting it. And the next set of emperors, the Julio-Claudians,
[02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:45.540]   which is the family that Augustus starts, they all basically are who is the nearest male relative to
[02:43:45.540 --> 02:43:51.060]   the previous emperor. And that's how we get a lot of crazy emperors like Caligula or Nero.
[02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:58.100]   And then the next family, the Flavians, the first guy is kind of an Augustus. It's Vespasian,
[02:43:58.100 --> 02:44:03.220]   the one who builds the Flavian amphitheater. And then one of his sons takes over Titus, who's okay.
[02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:08.660]   And then the next son takes over Domitian, who's nuts again. So heredity just isn't working.
[02:44:08.660 --> 02:44:09.220]   Yeah.
[02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:15.620]   And Rome fights a couple of civil wars. And in 98 AD, we're 100 years now into the empire,
[02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:19.780]   and they look back at this track record and say, "Okay, we've been picking our emperors by
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:26.340]   heredity, and we've gotten some real duds here, some real problematic people. Is there a way to
[02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:31.220]   fix this?" And this is one of the few instances where the Romans, who I keep saying are very
[02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:36.100]   traditional and resist change, I think actually make a change and realize we got to do something
[02:44:36.100 --> 02:44:42.420]   different. And so the next guy looks around and says, "Okay, forget who's my nearest male relative.
[02:44:42.420 --> 02:44:48.660]   Who's the best qualified to be emperor after me? I'll pick that person, and then I'll adopt him as
[02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:54.100]   my son." So they kind of stick with the heredity, but now it's this fake adoption. And you end up
[02:44:54.100 --> 02:45:00.260]   with a lot of old guys adopting middle-aged adults as their son, which is a little strange,
[02:45:00.260 --> 02:45:06.100]   but it works. And so for the next 80 years, you have only five emperors, and they're often called
[02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:11.300]   the five good emperors. They're not related necessarily by blood. They sort of pick the
[02:45:11.300 --> 02:45:17.460]   best qualified guy, and they're all sound, competent, good emperors. And the second century
[02:45:17.460 --> 02:45:24.580]   AD from Nerva to Marcus Aurelius is often regarded as the high point of the Roman Empire.
[02:45:24.580 --> 02:45:30.260]   And a lot of that comes from you have political stability. You have a succession of decent guys
[02:45:30.260 --> 02:45:35.860]   being emperor who rule relatively wisely, promote good policies. There's other things working to
[02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:40.820]   Rome's advantage, but that's good. And then where it falls apart is where the last guy,
[02:45:40.820 --> 02:45:46.900]   Marcus Aurelius, looks around and says, "Hmm, who's the best qualified guy to succeed me?
[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:52.740]   Ah, what a coincidence. It's my own dear son, who turns out to be a psycho." And then it all
[02:45:52.740 --> 02:45:59.380]   goes downhill. >> And some people place the collapse of the Roman Empire there at the end of
[02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:04.980]   Marcus Aurelius' rule. >> Yeah, so 180 AD is one common date for an early date for the end of the
[02:46:04.980 --> 02:46:10.820]   Roman Empire when you... Because from then on, it's a mixed bag of good and bad emperors.
[02:46:10.820 --> 02:46:17.380]   >> At the very least, this period is when the Roman Empire is at its height on all different
[02:46:17.380 --> 02:46:20.500]   kinds of perspectives. >> Certainly geographically. I mean,
[02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:25.540]   at this point, it stretches from Britain to Mesopotamia, from Egypt up to Germany. You know,
[02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:30.180]   like I said, probably about 50 million people within its boundaries. Within those boundaries,
[02:46:30.180 --> 02:46:34.500]   there's relative peace. So, I mean, sometimes people talk about the Pax Romana. I mean,
[02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:38.820]   the Romans are fighting lots of people, but within the boundaries, you have relative peace.
[02:46:38.820 --> 02:46:43.860]   There's relative economic prosperity. I mean, nothing in the ancient world is that prosperous.
[02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:48.980]   It's just a different sort of economy, but it's pretty stable. There's no huge disasters happening
[02:46:48.980 --> 02:46:56.340]   yet. Some plagues start in Marcus Aurelius' reign. But yeah, this is pretty much seen as the high
[02:46:56.340 --> 02:47:00.020]   point of the Roman Empire, and I think it is. I think that there's truth to that.
[02:47:00.020 --> 02:47:07.940]   >> Let me ask the ridiculously oversimplified question. But who do you think is the greatest
[02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:10.420]   Roman emperor? Maybe your top three. >> The greatest emperor?
[02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:20.740]   I'll tell you what. I'll tell you my favorite Roman who wasn't an emperor, and that's Marcus
[02:47:20.740 --> 02:47:28.660]   Agrippa, who was Augustus' right-hand man. So Agrippa's this interesting guy who is extremely
[02:47:28.660 --> 02:47:33.940]   talented. He's a terrific general. He's a terrific admiral. He's a great builder. He
[02:47:35.380 --> 02:47:39.780]   is kind of like the troubleshooter for Augustus. He's the guy who wins the Battle of Actium for
[02:47:39.780 --> 02:47:43.540]   Augustus. So literally, Augustus would not have become the first emperor without Agrippa.
[02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:48.820]   When Augustus rebuilds the city of Rome, it's Agrippa that he gives the job to. Agrippa
[02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:53.460]   rebuilds the campus marshes. He builds the first version of the Pantheon. He personally goes through
[02:47:53.460 --> 02:48:00.580]   the sewers to clean them out. And he just has this great set of qualities that he's very self-effacing.
[02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:07.460]   I think he likes power. He wants real power, but he realizes, "I don't have that kind of clever
[02:48:07.460 --> 02:48:12.980]   politician's ability to be the front guy. So I'll just serve my friend, Augustus,
[02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:18.660]   loyally." They were childhood friends. "I'll win the battles for Augustus, and I'll let him take
[02:48:18.660 --> 02:48:24.100]   all the credit. But I'll be his number two guy, and that's what I'm good at." And he realizes
[02:48:24.100 --> 02:48:28.500]   his limitations. I mean, so many people don't. So many people are like, "Oh, I just want to keep
[02:48:28.980 --> 02:48:32.820]   grabbing for more and more and more," when it's not something they're good at.
[02:48:32.820 --> 02:48:37.460]   And I think Agrippa says, "I'm good to this point, and I'll play that role and no more,
[02:48:37.460 --> 02:48:43.700]   and that'll give me a lot of power, but I'm not going to press it." And yeah, he's just
[02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:48.820]   very hardworking. He's modest. He's self-effacing. He's highly competent.
[02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:54.260]   I wonder how many people in history there are that are like the drivers, the COO of the whole
[02:48:54.260 --> 02:49:00.900]   operation that we don't really think about or don't talk about enough, to where they're really
[02:49:00.900 --> 02:49:05.460]   the mastermind. Or the ones who make something possible. I mean, even in this conversation
[02:49:05.460 --> 02:49:10.180]   today, you would not have Alexander the Great without his father, Philip II, having built that
[02:49:10.180 --> 02:49:15.700]   army and handed it to him on a silver platter. Octavian would never have become emperor without
[02:49:15.700 --> 02:49:22.180]   Agrippa. So they play central roles sometimes. But if I had to pick an emperor, I'd probably pick
[02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:29.140]   Augustus just because of his influence. And because I admire his... The thing Agrippa didn't
[02:49:29.140 --> 02:49:34.980]   have, his political savvy, his manipulation of image and propaganda, all that, I find very
[02:49:34.980 --> 02:49:41.140]   fascinating. Though I'm not sure he's a great human being, but he's a really interesting figure.
[02:49:41.140 --> 02:49:49.540]   Whether he's good or bad, he was extremely influential on defining just the entirety of
[02:49:49.540 --> 02:49:55.860]   human history that followed. Probably one of the most influential humans ever. Nevertheless,
[02:49:55.860 --> 02:50:01.860]   if you ask in public who the most famous Roman emperor is, would that be Marcus Aurelius
[02:50:01.860 --> 02:50:08.420]   potentially? I don't know. But he's up there, right? He's real famous because he was a Stoic
[02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:12.340]   philosopher and he wrote this book, The Meditations. I mean, it's interesting. Stoicism
[02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:20.580]   as a philosophical ideology had a role to play during that time. I mean, there's the tragic
[02:50:20.580 --> 02:50:24.740]   fact that... Did Nero murder Seneca?
[02:50:24.740 --> 02:50:29.300]   Yes. Well, he drove him to suicide, let's say.
[02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:34.260]   There's a lot of interesting questions there. But one is like the role, especially when it's
[02:50:34.260 --> 02:50:42.260]   hereditary, the role of the mentor, like who advises who with Aristotle and Alexander the
[02:50:42.260 --> 02:50:50.580]   Great, that dance of who influences and guides the person as they gain power is really interesting.
[02:50:50.580 --> 02:50:54.020]   Well, I mean, one of the big questions with the Roman emperors, and we've been talking about some
[02:50:54.020 --> 02:51:03.060]   of them, is why did so many seem to be either crazy or just kind of sadists? And I don't know
[02:51:03.060 --> 02:51:07.540]   that there's a good answer to that. I mean, people have theories, oh, Caligula got a brain fever and
[02:51:07.540 --> 02:51:14.180]   changed after that or something. But I think there's a lot of maybe truth in the notion that
[02:51:14.180 --> 02:51:18.980]   the ones who seem to go craziest quite often are the ones who become emperor at a young age.
[02:51:18.980 --> 02:51:24.580]   And there is something about that old cliche that absolute power corrupts absolutely,
[02:51:24.580 --> 02:51:29.700]   especially if your own personality isn't really fully formed yet. You know what I'm saying?
[02:51:29.700 --> 02:51:33.620]   I mean, I think take anybody when they're a teenager. If you all of a sudden said,
[02:51:33.620 --> 02:51:38.900]   you have unlimited power, what would that do to you? How would that warp your personality? I mean,
[02:51:38.900 --> 02:51:42.820]   look at all the, what do they always have today, like the Disney stars who sort of go wrong or
[02:51:42.820 --> 02:51:46.020]   something because they get rich and famous at this very young age.
[02:51:46.020 --> 02:51:52.980]   Yeah, fame, power, and even money, if you get way too much of it at a young age. I think we're
[02:51:52.980 --> 02:52:01.060]   egotistical, narcissistic, all that kind of stuff as babies. And then when we clash with the world
[02:52:01.060 --> 02:52:06.180]   and we figure out the morality of the world, how to interact with others, that other people
[02:52:06.180 --> 02:52:12.260]   suffer in all kinds of ways, understand like the cruelty, the beauty of the world, the fact that
[02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:16.580]   other people suffer in different ways, the fact that other people are also human and have different
[02:52:16.580 --> 02:52:22.500]   perspectives, all of that in order to develop that you shouldn't be blocked off from the world,
[02:52:22.500 --> 02:52:26.660]   which power and money and fame can do. And conversely, a lot of the emperors we
[02:52:26.660 --> 02:52:32.420]   regard as "good emperors" are the ones who become emperor at middle-aged or something,
[02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:36.820]   where their personalities are fully formed, where they're not going to really become
[02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:42.420]   different people. And so, that works in that theory too. I mean, I don't think it's absolute.
[02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:48.100]   And of course, the greatest exception is Octavian Augustus, who starts his rise to
[02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:54.980]   power as a teenager, somehow doesn't seem to go nuts. It's not an absolute, but it doesn't help
[02:52:54.980 --> 02:53:00.500]   to get that much power at a young age, I think. >> What does it take to be a successful emperor,
[02:53:00.500 --> 02:53:05.700]   would you say? >> So, you say, "What does it take to be a good Roman emperor?" If you were
[02:53:05.700 --> 02:53:10.980]   going to draw up a job description, "Seeking Roman emperor," what are the qualities and
[02:53:10.980 --> 02:53:17.780]   qualifications you would put on it? Obviously, you would put responsible, good understanding of
[02:53:17.780 --> 02:53:24.420]   military, economics, whatever ability to delegate. But just to be fun, let's consider how much does
[02:53:24.420 --> 02:53:31.700]   it matter whether the emperor is good or bad? Because in the ancient world, what does it affect
[02:53:31.700 --> 02:53:40.180]   really if you're, say, a peasant in Spain, if the emperor is crazy Nero or good Vespasian?
[02:53:40.180 --> 02:53:45.140]   I mean, how does that affect your day-to-day life? How does it affect you if you're a peasant in
[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:53.700]   Italy, which is the average inhabitant? I mean, the crazy emperors mostly affect the people within
[02:53:53.700 --> 02:53:58.980]   the sound of their voice. So yeah, they go crazy, they murder senators, they murder their members
[02:53:58.980 --> 02:54:04.180]   of their own family, they do wacky stuff. But a lot of that is constrained to the immediate
[02:54:04.180 --> 02:54:11.140]   surroundings around them. And meanwhile, the mechanism of the Roman Empire is just grinding
[02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:16.260]   along as it would anyway. I mean, the governors are running their provinces, stuff's happening.
[02:54:16.260 --> 02:54:22.900]   I mean, I guess an emperor can start a war, he can maybe raise taxes, but that would be the ways
[02:54:22.900 --> 02:54:26.660]   that he's affecting the whole empire. And here we get into technology does matter.
[02:54:26.660 --> 02:54:31.140]   We're dealing with a world where let's say you're in Rome and you're the emperor and you want to
[02:54:31.140 --> 02:54:39.700]   send a message to a province far away, let's say Judea. That message might take one or two months
[02:54:39.700 --> 02:54:46.420]   to get there and one or two months to get a reply. So how much influence as emperor are you really
[02:54:46.420 --> 02:54:51.380]   having over that province? I mean, those people pretty much have to make their own decisions
[02:54:51.380 --> 02:54:55.220]   and then kind of just say to you, "This is what we did, I hope that's okay." Because otherwise,
[02:54:55.220 --> 02:54:57.940]   nothing gets done if they're waiting four months for a decision.
[02:54:57.940 --> 02:55:04.820]   >> Even in the realm of ideas, they can't get on TV and on the radio and broadcasts.
[02:55:04.820 --> 02:55:10.900]   >> Yeah, communication is so slow and so uncertain in ways that today with the ability
[02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:15.220]   to instantaneously talk to people across the world, we can't even imagine. And the Roman
[02:55:15.220 --> 02:55:21.540]   empire is huge. I mean, it is months to send a message and get an answer. So here you have
[02:55:21.540 --> 02:55:25.860]   the emperor in Rome, yeah, he affects who's around him and he can affect even common people. I mean,
[02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:29.940]   there's crazy emperors who are at the games and they're bored and they say, "Well, take that whole
[02:55:29.940 --> 02:55:34.100]   section of the crowd and throw them to the lions or something." There you're being affected by the
[02:55:34.100 --> 02:55:40.740]   emperor. But if you're outside the range of his sight and voice, do you care who the emperor is?
[02:55:40.740 --> 02:55:41.460]   >> So the big one-
[02:55:41.460 --> 02:55:42.100]   >> Most of the time.
[02:55:42.180 --> 02:55:47.460]   >> That's a really important idea to remember. Same with the US president, frankly,
[02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:55.620]   in terms of the grand art of history, like what is the actual impact? But I would say the big
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:56:03.940]   one is probably starting wars, major global wars, or ending them in both directions. And then
[02:56:03.940 --> 02:56:08.580]   taxation too, as you said. What was the taxation? What was the economic system? What was the role
[02:56:08.580 --> 02:56:10.100]   of taxation in the Roman empire?
[02:56:10.100 --> 02:56:16.740]   >> Romans are really weird with this. So in the Republic, once they started to acquire overseas
[02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:20.820]   provinces, they had to decide, "Well, what are we going to do with these provinces?"
[02:56:20.820 --> 02:56:25.700]   And they, in the end, settled on this notion of, "We'll put a Roman governor in charge,
[02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:31.540]   we'll collect some sort of taxes." But they often didn't collect the taxes directly. Instead,
[02:56:31.540 --> 02:56:37.940]   they would sell contracts to private businesses to collect taxes. So the private businesses would
[02:56:37.940 --> 02:56:42.580]   bid and say, "All right, if you give us the contract to collect taxes in Sicily, we'll give
[02:56:42.580 --> 02:56:49.060]   you X number of money up front, and then we go out and try to collect enough to make back that money
[02:56:49.060 --> 02:56:53.460]   and make ourselves a profit." And this is a terrible system, because obviously, they're
[02:56:53.460 --> 02:56:59.380]   going to go and try and squeeze as much as they can out of Sicily. And these companies were called
[02:56:59.380 --> 02:57:05.460]   publicans, publicani. And in the Bible, there's a phrase, "publicans and sinners," and that should
[02:57:05.460 --> 02:57:11.540]   give you an idea how they're viewed. So everybody hated these tax collectors. And it was a really
[02:57:11.540 --> 02:57:18.180]   kind of dumb system, because the publicans were going out and squeezing way more than they should
[02:57:18.180 --> 02:57:23.620]   in an unhealthy way from the provinces. And the Roman state was doing this kind of weird thing
[02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:27.940]   that they should have been doing themselves. And over time, that shifts a bit, and it becomes more
[02:57:27.940 --> 02:57:33.220]   like your standard taxation. And a lot of the taxation ends up being in kind too. So it's like,
[02:57:33.220 --> 02:57:37.620]   okay, we're taxing you, you pay it in wheat if you're a farmer or something, not necessarily in
[02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:46.020]   cash. So it was... In many ways, the Roman economy is underdeveloped. They didn't have a lot of the
[02:57:46.020 --> 02:57:52.260]   sophisticated systems that we have today, and it probably held them back in some ways. And again,
[02:57:52.260 --> 02:57:59.460]   they have that resistance to change. The Romans also had weird notions about just business and
[02:57:59.460 --> 02:58:04.500]   profit making, that at least originally there was this notion that's shameful. Again, the only thing
[02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:11.940]   that's a worthwhile profession is farming. So rich Romans would get involved in what we would
[02:58:11.940 --> 02:58:17.140]   call business, manufacturing, particularly long distance trade with ships, but they would often do
[02:58:17.140 --> 02:58:22.260]   it through sort of front companies or employees who did it on their behalf officially, and then
[02:58:22.260 --> 02:58:27.060]   they sort of funnel the profits to the guy funding it because they don't want to be soiled with
[02:58:27.620 --> 02:58:32.260]   business, which is beneath them. So the Romans had a lot of weird attitudes about the economy
[02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:37.620]   that I think in some ways didn't help. >> But nevertheless, they had many of the
[02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:43.060]   elements of the modern economic system with taxation, the record keeping.
[02:58:43.060 --> 02:58:47.300]   >> They were good at record keeping. So the Romans, I mean, the census is a Roman word.
[02:58:47.300 --> 02:58:51.220]   They're the ones that came up with that. >> And obviously the laws around everything.
[02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:54.660]   >> Yes. So in certain ways, yes, they were extremely sophisticated. And of course,
[02:58:55.140 --> 02:58:59.460]   the biggest thing about people in the ancient world and today is that they weren't stupider
[02:58:59.460 --> 02:59:03.380]   than us. I mean, sometimes you get this assumption, oh, well, in the ancient world,
[02:59:03.380 --> 02:59:07.300]   they just weren't as smart or something. No, no, no, they were fully as intelligent as we were.
[02:59:07.300 --> 02:59:11.780]   They didn't have access to the same technology as we do, but that doesn't mean they were any
[02:59:11.780 --> 02:59:18.580]   less smart. >> Can we talk about the crisis of the third century and the aforementioned
[02:59:19.140 --> 02:59:27.380]   Western and Eastern Roman empires, how it split? >> Yeah. So I mean, after Rome starts to go
[02:59:27.380 --> 02:59:32.900]   downhill as you enter the third century, so the 200s, so we're moving out of the golden era now.
[02:59:32.900 --> 02:59:38.100]   I mean, a famous Roman historian Cassius Dio, who lived right at that moment,
[02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:43.380]   very famously wrote of the transition of Marcus Aurelius to what follows,
[02:59:43.380 --> 02:59:50.260]   "Our kingdom now descends from one of gold to one of rust and iron." So even people who were alive
[02:59:50.260 --> 02:59:56.580]   at the time had a distinct sense something is going downhill here. And that's interesting,
[02:59:56.580 --> 03:00:01.780]   because usually great historical moments are retroactive. And I mean, here's a guy who said,
[03:00:01.780 --> 03:00:08.020]   "Oh, something's going wrong. Something's really going badly now." And a lot of it becomes that
[03:00:08.740 --> 03:00:13.860]   the secret is out, that what makes an emperor is who commands the most swords.
[03:00:13.860 --> 03:00:20.420]   And so you start to get rebellions by various Roman generals, each declaring himself emperor.
[03:00:20.420 --> 03:00:24.180]   So you'd always had this to a certain degree, but they had kept it in check during the second
[03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:29.460]   century AD. But in the third century, you sometimes get three or four generals in different parts of
[03:00:29.460 --> 03:00:34.660]   the empire all declaring themselves emperor, and then they all rush off to Rome to fight
[03:00:34.660 --> 03:00:39.380]   a multi-way civil war. And of course, while they're doing this, the borders are undefended.
[03:00:39.380 --> 03:00:44.660]   So barbarians start to see opportunity and come across and start raiding. They start burning and
[03:00:44.660 --> 03:00:51.060]   pillaging farms. The civil wars are destroying cities and farms. So the economy is kind of
[03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:57.620]   tanking. Then there's less money coming in as taxes. So when one guy finally wins, he jacks up
[03:00:57.620 --> 03:01:02.260]   the tax rate to try and make up for it, but now there's fewer people able to pay, and it's all
[03:01:02.260 --> 03:01:09.300]   just a vicious cycle. The Romans start to debase the coinage, which means you take in a gold coin,
[03:01:09.300 --> 03:01:14.740]   you melt it down, mix it in with 10% something less valuable, and then stamp it and say it's
[03:01:14.740 --> 03:01:19.060]   worth the same. Well, people aren't stupid. They're going to know that's only 90% of that
[03:01:19.060 --> 03:01:20.740]   gold coin. >> Invented inflation.
[03:01:20.740 --> 03:01:26.580]   >> Inflation. And you get horrific inflation uncontrolled. So the economy goes downhill,
[03:01:26.580 --> 03:01:31.220]   barbarians are raiding, you have internal instability. In one year, you have something
[03:01:31.220 --> 03:01:37.620]   like eight or nine different guys go through as emperor in 238. So it's a mess. And it looks like
[03:01:37.620 --> 03:01:42.420]   the Roman empire is going to fall in around the mid third century. So this is the crisis.
[03:01:42.420 --> 03:01:48.420]   And then the kind of shocking development is late in that third century, they actually
[03:01:48.420 --> 03:01:54.740]   stabilize the empire. So you have a series of these kind of army emperors who are just good
[03:01:54.740 --> 03:02:02.180]   generals who managed to push the barbarians out, reestablish the borders. It's actually a whole
[03:02:02.180 --> 03:02:06.820]   group of them, but often they get clumped under the most successful, the last guy who's Diocletian
[03:02:06.820 --> 03:02:14.020]   who comes in, and he tries to stabilize the economy. One of the things he does is he issues
[03:02:14.020 --> 03:02:20.900]   a new solid gold coin that he guarantees is solid gold, and he calls it a solidus, a solid coin.
[03:02:21.620 --> 03:02:27.460]   He famously issues a price edict where he says, "This is the maximum it's legal to charge
[03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:32.740]   for any good or service." So it's an attempt to curb inflation. And that's not gonna work,
[03:02:32.740 --> 03:02:38.980]   but it helps. Kind of amusingly, on Diocletian's price edict, can you guess what the most expensive
[03:02:38.980 --> 03:02:46.020]   sort of item is? Hiring a lawyer. So some things never change, right?
[03:02:46.020 --> 03:02:51.140]   That's interesting. I mean, in that system, there's probably a huge amount of lawyers.
[03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:54.740]   Yeah. I mean, even lawyer isn't quite the right word. Romans didn't have true lawyers,
[03:02:54.740 --> 03:02:59.620]   but they had people you would hire to do legal stuff or give you legal advice. But anyway.
[03:02:59.620 --> 03:03:03.300]   No, the price edict is actually really fascinating because it's this long list of stuff,
[03:03:03.300 --> 03:03:07.700]   and you can see a good pair of shoes, a bad pair of shoes, how much each costs,
[03:03:07.700 --> 03:03:14.100]   and you can see the relative value of things. So what was food versus clothing? What was going to
[03:03:14.100 --> 03:03:19.220]   the barber versus hiring a doctor? All that kind of stuff. So it's a really fun document to just
[03:03:19.220 --> 03:03:25.300]   mess around with. But anyway, so Diocletian stabilizes basically the empire and these
[03:03:25.300 --> 03:03:31.540]   other guys as well, and gives it a new lease on life. So it seems by the end of the third century
[03:03:31.540 --> 03:03:36.500]   that Rome is gonna continue. And then as we go into the fourth century, you have the really
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:43.140]   dramatic thing where Constantine comes along and converts to Christianity. And at the time he
[03:03:43.140 --> 03:03:49.780]   converts, the percentage of Christians in the empire is small, 10% at most, something like that.
[03:03:49.780 --> 03:03:54.420]   Who knows? But it's quite small. And all of a sudden you have this weird thing where now the
[03:03:54.420 --> 03:04:00.740]   emperor belongs to this new religion. What does this mean? You can debate a lot how sincere
[03:04:00.740 --> 03:04:07.220]   Constantine's conversion was. It's a little bit of a weird thing where he clearly is using it as
[03:04:07.220 --> 03:04:12.180]   a way to fire up the troops before a crucial battle to say, "Hey, I just had this dream and
[03:04:12.180 --> 03:04:17.300]   this god promised us victory if we put his magic symbol on our shields." And this would be okay,
[03:04:17.300 --> 03:04:21.860]   except that he had done this a couple times before. So one time it was Helios, the sun god,
[03:04:21.860 --> 03:04:27.780]   one time it was another god. Even after he converts, he continues to mint coins and stuff with
[03:04:27.780 --> 03:04:33.460]   other gods on them. He continues to worship other gods. But he also kind of seems sincere in his
[03:04:33.460 --> 03:04:38.660]   conversion. It's just, I think the question is how much does he understand his new religion,
[03:04:38.660 --> 03:04:42.900]   maybe more than is it sincere? But that's a real turning point.
[03:04:42.900 --> 03:04:47.300]   So now as you go into the fourth century, we have this thing with Constantine, the new religion. And
[03:04:47.300 --> 03:04:53.140]   the other thing that happens is the empire is really just too big to govern effectively. It's
[03:04:53.140 --> 03:04:58.340]   a thing we're talking about. It's too large, the communication is too slow, and it starts to
[03:04:58.340 --> 03:05:05.540]   naturally fragment. And at times they try systems where they split it into four. So under Diocletian
[03:05:05.540 --> 03:05:09.940]   he tries the Tetrarchy, where he splits the empire into four, and you actually have sort of four
[03:05:09.940 --> 03:05:16.900]   emperors working together as a team. More commonly, it just splits east-west. So from that point on,
[03:05:16.900 --> 03:05:21.220]   you really start to have the history of the Western Empire going in one direction,
[03:05:21.220 --> 03:05:26.420]   the Eastern Empire in the other. You tend to have two emperors, though there are moments
[03:05:26.420 --> 03:05:31.700]   occasionally where they reunite. So that's a big development as well, and that's a turning point.
[03:05:32.660 --> 03:05:38.500]   So the most common date that people say, maybe you can correct me on this, that the Roman Empire fell
[03:05:38.500 --> 03:05:45.380]   is 476 AD. They're referring to the fall, quote-unquote, of the Western Roman Empire.
[03:05:45.380 --> 03:05:51.860]   So why did the Roman Empire fall? Yeah, this is a real game. Pick your favorite date for the
[03:05:51.860 --> 03:05:58.020]   Roman Empire. 476 is a very common one. And what happens in that year is a barbarian king comes
[03:05:58.580 --> 03:06:05.620]   down into Italy and deposes a guy named Romulus Augustulus, which is an amazing name.
[03:06:05.620 --> 03:06:12.100]   It's combining the names of the founder of Rome, Romulus, with Augustus, the second founder of
[03:06:12.100 --> 03:06:20.340]   Rome. And so some people say that's the end of the Roman Empire. Sure. But others say it's 410
[03:06:20.340 --> 03:06:27.700]   when Alaric sacks Rome for the first time. Others say it's 455 when the Vandals come and sack Rome
[03:06:27.700 --> 03:06:34.020]   and do a much more thorough job of it this time. Some say it's 180 when Marcus Aurelius picks poorly
[03:06:34.020 --> 03:06:39.700]   in succession. Some say it's 31 when Octavian wins the Battle of Actium and kills the Roman Republic.
[03:06:39.700 --> 03:06:47.620]   Or you can go past that date and say it's 1453 when the Eastern Roman Empire finally falls.
[03:06:47.620 --> 03:06:51.380]   And I mean, the Eastern Empire is legitimately the Roman Empire. If you were going to ask them,
[03:06:51.380 --> 03:06:55.380]   "Who are you?" they wouldn't say, "We're the Byzantines. We're the Eastern Roman Empire."
[03:06:55.380 --> 03:07:01.380]   They would just say, "We're the Romans." And they have a completely legitimate claim to do that.
[03:07:01.380 --> 03:07:07.300]   So this whole game of when does the empire fall is problematic. And the other thing is
[03:07:07.300 --> 03:07:13.700]   all those dates about invasions that cluster around the 400s, so 410, 455, 476,
[03:07:13.700 --> 03:07:21.700]   you have to ask yourself, "Who counts as a real Roman by that point?" Because for a while now,
[03:07:21.700 --> 03:07:29.460]   the Romans themselves are often coming from barbarians, are crossing that boundary Roman
[03:07:29.460 --> 03:07:33.940]   generals. They might get raised as a Hun, then serve with the Roman army for a while, then not,
[03:07:33.940 --> 03:07:41.460]   or Visigoths or not. That's been going on for a long time. So what makes someone a real Roman?
[03:07:41.460 --> 03:07:47.940]   How do you tell that the guy kicked out in 476 was a "real Roman" and the barbarian king who took his
[03:07:47.940 --> 03:07:54.820]   place wasn't? That's a very arbitrary decision. There's so many interesting things there. So
[03:07:54.820 --> 03:08:01.060]   of course, you've described really eloquently the decline that started after Marcus Aurelius,
[03:08:01.060 --> 03:08:03.940]   and there's a lot of competing ideas there and the tensions.
[03:08:03.940 --> 03:08:08.660]   Just to interrupt you, I hate wishy-washy answers, which is what I said. So I will give you this. I
[03:08:08.660 --> 03:08:14.900]   think by the end of the 5th century AD, the Western Roman Empire has transformed into something
[03:08:14.900 --> 03:08:22.100]   different. So I don't know what date I can pick for that, but I can say by the end, by around 500,
[03:08:22.100 --> 03:08:26.740]   I don't know that we can call whatever exists there the Roman Empire anymore.
[03:08:26.740 --> 03:08:30.500]   And of course, the barbarians make everything complicated because they seem to be willing to
[03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:36.980]   fight on every side and they're like fluid, which they integrate fast and it just makes the whole
[03:08:36.980 --> 03:08:43.540]   thing really tricky to say, "Yeah, who's a Roman, who is not, and at which point did it like..."
[03:08:43.540 --> 03:08:47.300]   And barbarians have been forming large parts of the Roman army for centuries.
[03:08:47.300 --> 03:08:54.260]   Yeah, it's extremely fluid and not at all just clear sides here. So it's a mess.
[03:08:54.260 --> 03:08:59.140]   From a military perspective, perhaps, what are some things that stand out to you
[03:08:59.140 --> 03:09:06.660]   on the pressure from the barbarians, the conflicts, whether it's the Hans or the Visigoths?
[03:09:06.660 --> 03:09:11.860]   There was a military strategist, a guy named Edward Luttwak, who wrote this book,
[03:09:11.860 --> 03:09:17.380]   The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, which was basically about frontiers and how did the
[03:09:17.380 --> 03:09:21.940]   Romans define their frontier. And everybody's jumped on this and argue about it and says it's
[03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:27.700]   wrong and all, but started this debate among Roman historians about, yeah, what does frontier mean to
[03:09:27.700 --> 03:09:33.220]   the Romans? Did they conceive of their empires having a border or was it always expanding or
[03:09:33.220 --> 03:09:39.300]   what? And did they have a grand strategy? I mean, today, militaries have a strategy where we want
[03:09:39.300 --> 03:09:45.300]   to achieve this, we want to exert force here, we want to protect these areas. Did the Romans even
[03:09:45.300 --> 03:09:51.140]   visualize their empire in that sort of grand strategic way? And it's a real debate. I mean,
[03:09:51.140 --> 03:09:57.300]   there's some things that suggest, oh, here they tried to rationalize the border and shorten it by
[03:09:57.300 --> 03:10:03.620]   taking this territory. Other people see it as just kind of random. So that's an interesting take is
[03:10:03.620 --> 03:10:09.060]   how do the Romans conceive of empire? I mean, if you look back at someone like Virgil at the time
[03:10:09.060 --> 03:10:15.700]   of Augustus, he said, "Well, the gods granted Rome empire without end." So it's that open-ended
[03:10:15.700 --> 03:10:19.940]   thing. But even under Augustus, he seems to be pulling back and saying, "Well, I'm going to kind
[03:10:19.940 --> 03:10:24.660]   of stop at the Rhine, I'm going to kind of stop at the Danube. We don't need to keep expanding
[03:10:24.660 --> 03:10:31.860]   forever in the way we've been doing." So I mean, that's an interesting concept of how do the Romans
[03:10:31.860 --> 03:10:36.340]   see their empire? Does it have a boundary? What are those boundaries? What does that mean?
[03:10:36.340 --> 03:10:42.740]   >> And then barbarians were very much making that boundary even more difficult to kind of
[03:10:42.740 --> 03:10:45.620]   define it even if you wanted to. >> Right. And again, the other fun
[03:10:45.620 --> 03:10:52.340]   debate is were these invasions, when the Visigoths cross the Danube and come into the Roman empire,
[03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:58.500]   is this an invasion as it was originally described or is it a migration as some scholars have started
[03:10:58.500 --> 03:11:03.780]   calling it? Because the Visigoths were fleeing pressure from another Gothic group and they were
[03:11:03.780 --> 03:11:09.620]   fleeing pressure from the Huns. And I mean, a lot of the early Gothic peoples who come into the Roman
[03:11:09.620 --> 03:11:15.140]   empire are basically seeking asylum. They're saying, "Will you give us a piece of territory to
[03:11:15.140 --> 03:11:20.340]   live on within the boundaries of the empire? And in return, we will fight for you against external
[03:11:20.340 --> 03:11:25.300]   enemies." And the Romans make these deals with some of the Goths. In fact, they made a pretty
[03:11:25.300 --> 03:11:30.260]   good deal with the Goths, one group of Goths to do exactly that. You can settle within the
[03:11:30.260 --> 03:11:34.500]   boundaries, we'll feed you, we'll give you a certain amount of stuff and you fight for us.
[03:11:34.500 --> 03:11:39.220]   And then the Romans treated them really badly. They kind of didn't supply what they had promised
[03:11:39.220 --> 03:11:44.500]   and so they turned against the Romans with good reason. So the Romans blundered in these things
[03:11:44.500 --> 03:11:47.220]   too. >> So is it correct that the Visigoths
[03:11:47.220 --> 03:11:50.100]   fought on the side of the Romans against Attila the Hun?
[03:11:50.100 --> 03:11:56.900]   >> Some of them did. So again, there were various groups on both sides of those battles. So Attila
[03:11:56.900 --> 03:12:04.420]   is the famous Hun and he comes into the Roman empire and seems to be heading right for Rome
[03:12:04.420 --> 03:12:12.100]   to knock it off. And everybody is so scared of the Huns that this weird coalition comes together
[03:12:12.100 --> 03:12:16.500]   of the Romans plus various barbarian groups against Attila and league with some other
[03:12:16.500 --> 03:12:20.740]   barbarian groups and they fight a huge battle and it's more or less a stalemate.
[03:12:20.740 --> 03:12:25.380]   So Attila gets stopped and he says, "All right, we're going to just rest up for a year. Next year,
[03:12:25.380 --> 03:12:30.740]   we'll go finish off the Romans." Next year comes, he heads down into Italy. He's heading straight
[03:12:30.740 --> 03:12:36.900]   for Rome and the Pope goes and meets Attila and they have lunch together at this river.
[03:12:36.900 --> 03:12:42.340]   And at the end of the lunch, Attila goes back and says, "Eh, I changed my mind. We're going to go
[03:12:42.340 --> 03:12:45.700]   back up to France, hang around for another year. We'll finish off the Romans later."
[03:12:45.700 --> 03:12:53.220]   And Christian sources say saints appeared in the sky with flaming swords and scared away Attila.
[03:12:54.100 --> 03:12:58.580]   Some other sources say, well, the Pope gave Attila a huge bribe to go away for a while,
[03:12:58.580 --> 03:13:05.700]   believe whichever you like. But then Attila ends up dying on his wedding night before he comes back
[03:13:05.700 --> 03:13:12.340]   under mysterious circumstances. And so that never materializes and the Huns fragment after his death.
[03:13:12.340 --> 03:13:17.780]   So what was the definitive blow by the barbarians, by the Visigoths?
[03:13:17.780 --> 03:13:23.620]   The barbarians are so many different groups. And weirdly, I think an important one that sometimes
[03:13:23.620 --> 03:13:29.060]   people tend to focus on the Huns and the Goths, the Vandals end up going to Spain,
[03:13:29.060 --> 03:13:35.220]   conquering Spain, and then crossing over into North Africa and kind of conquering North Africa as
[03:13:35.220 --> 03:13:44.100]   well. And Spain and North Africa were some of the main areas that food surpluses were collected from
[03:13:44.100 --> 03:13:50.260]   and sent to Rome to feed the city of Rome. And it's after those Vandal invasions or the takeover
[03:13:50.260 --> 03:13:55.620]   of those areas that the population of Rome plummets. So I think that's an interesting moment
[03:13:55.620 --> 03:14:01.140]   where the city of Rome had always been this symbol, and already it was no longer the capital.
[03:14:01.140 --> 03:14:06.180]   The emperors had moved to Ravenna a little bit north because it was surrounded by swamps,
[03:14:06.180 --> 03:14:11.220]   so it was more defensible. But there is something important about that old symbolic capital now
[03:14:11.220 --> 03:14:16.740]   just collapsing in terms of population numbers, really no longer having importance because
[03:14:16.740 --> 03:14:23.460]   literally its food supply is cut off by losing those areas of the empire. And of course, the
[03:14:23.460 --> 03:14:30.420]   capital, Constantine had founded a new second capital at what used to be Byzantium, a Greek
[03:14:30.420 --> 03:14:35.460]   city on the Bosphorus, which becomes Constantinople. He names it not very modestly after himself.
[03:14:35.460 --> 03:14:42.020]   And that now is really the dominant city for any of the Roman empires, Eastern or Western.
[03:14:42.020 --> 03:14:44.580]   So if you're actually living in that century, the fifth century,
[03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:51.780]   it's kind of like the Western Roman empire dies with a whimper. It's not like a bunch of...
[03:14:51.780 --> 03:14:56.180]   There's a lot of moments you can pick. There's an earlier one in the 300s when the Roman empire,
[03:14:56.180 --> 03:15:02.340]   the Romans lose a big battle to some barbarians that symbolically is important. But yeah,
[03:15:02.340 --> 03:15:06.340]   I don't think there's one clear cut moment. And again, I don't know that it is the barbarians
[03:15:06.340 --> 03:15:11.060]   that cause "the fall of the Roman empire." I mean, this is the other game as people like to say,
[03:15:11.060 --> 03:15:17.700]   "When did the Roman empire fall?" The other big question is why? Why did the Roman empire fall
[03:15:17.700 --> 03:15:24.420]   if you define it as falling? And I mean, barbarian invasions was the traditional answer.
[03:15:24.420 --> 03:15:28.420]   So there's a French historian famously said, "The Roman empire didn't fall,
[03:15:28.420 --> 03:15:34.260]   it was murdered. It was killed by barbarians." But I mean, there's other explanations.
[03:15:36.180 --> 03:15:43.700]   I mean, some people say it was Christianity. Some say it was climate, that the Roman empire
[03:15:43.700 --> 03:15:48.260]   flourished during this moment of luck when just the climate was good. And then you get
[03:15:48.260 --> 03:15:53.540]   this sort of late Roman little ice age and everything goes downhill and that's what caused it.
[03:15:53.540 --> 03:16:00.100]   There's some that say things like disease. There were a whole series of waves of plague
[03:16:00.100 --> 03:16:05.140]   that started to hit under Marcus Aurelius and continued after him, which seemed to have caused
[03:16:05.140 --> 03:16:10.820]   real serious death and economic disruption. I mean, that's a decent explanation.
[03:16:10.820 --> 03:16:16.260]   Another popular one is moral decline, which I don't think really works well. You even get the
[03:16:16.260 --> 03:16:20.420]   people saying, "You know, lead poisoning," but that's not true because they were drinking out
[03:16:20.420 --> 03:16:24.980]   of the same pipes when the empire was expanding, right? Yeah, that's fascinating. That's fascinating.
[03:16:24.980 --> 03:16:31.780]   But often we kind of agree that's something that you've talked about quite a bit is the
[03:16:31.780 --> 03:16:38.980]   military perspective is the one that defines the rise and fall of empires. You have a really great
[03:16:38.980 --> 03:16:44.980]   lecture series called The Decisive Battles of World History, which is another fascinating
[03:16:44.980 --> 03:16:49.140]   perspective to look at world history. What makes a battle decisive?
[03:16:49.140 --> 03:16:57.060]   The easiest definition is it causes an immediate change in political structures, who's in charge.
[03:16:57.620 --> 03:17:03.860]   So the classic decisive political battle is Alexander beats King Darius III at the Battle
[03:17:03.860 --> 03:17:11.060]   of Gagamela. And in that moment, we switch from the ruler of the entire huge Persian empire being
[03:17:11.060 --> 03:17:16.180]   Darius to now being Alexander, from it being Persian to being controlled by the Macedonians.
[03:17:16.180 --> 03:17:22.820]   So there is a one afternoon has this dramatic switch over a enormous geographic area, right?
[03:17:22.820 --> 03:17:28.740]   So that's a decisive battle and that you see that immediate change. Other types of decisive battles
[03:17:28.740 --> 03:17:33.460]   are ones that might have more unforeseen long-term effects. You may not realize this
[03:17:33.460 --> 03:17:39.300]   is decisive at the time, but from a longer perspective, it is. And often those are ones
[03:17:39.300 --> 03:17:48.980]   that either allow some new people or idea or institution to either grow or have its growth
[03:17:48.980 --> 03:17:54.820]   curbed. So at various points, we have empires that were expanding and basically were stopped
[03:17:54.820 --> 03:17:58.180]   at some battle. And so you say, well, if they hadn't been stopped there, they might've gone
[03:17:58.180 --> 03:18:06.260]   on to dominate this whole area. Or conversely, you could say Rome wasn't... They were one place
[03:18:06.260 --> 03:18:10.980]   before the Second Punic War, after the Second Punic War, they were its dominant force. So you
[03:18:10.980 --> 03:18:15.060]   could pick one of those battles and say that was decisive in setting them on this new path.
[03:18:15.620 --> 03:18:20.340]   It's also an opportunity to demonstrate a new technology. And if that technology is effective,
[03:18:20.340 --> 03:18:28.740]   it changes history because that was either tactical or literally the technology used.
[03:18:28.740 --> 03:18:34.100]   So how important is technology and that technological advantage in war?
[03:18:34.100 --> 03:18:41.460]   Huge. I mean, the history of warfare is basically the history of technological change often. So I
[03:18:41.460 --> 03:18:46.340]   mean, there's all the great moments of transition for a long time. We fought with hand to hand
[03:18:46.340 --> 03:18:53.060]   with metal weapons. Then you start to have the gunpowder revolution, which causes all sorts
[03:18:53.060 --> 03:18:59.780]   of shifts there. There's big changes, planes when they become a huge force. I mean, World War II is
[03:18:59.780 --> 03:19:07.700]   this crazy time where planes go from literally biplanes, string and wood to jets four years later.
[03:19:09.140 --> 03:19:13.780]   So that's this moment of incredibly fast technological change. Going into World War II,
[03:19:13.780 --> 03:19:18.100]   everybody thinks it's all about battleships. Who's got the biggest battleships? Four years later,
[03:19:18.100 --> 03:19:23.300]   battleships are just junk. Let's just scrap them. It's all about aircraft carriers and that's
[03:19:23.300 --> 03:19:28.340]   everything war at sea. So you have these moments of particularly in warfare,
[03:19:28.340 --> 03:19:36.100]   almost accelerated technological change where things happen very rapidly. And the civilization
[03:19:36.100 --> 03:19:41.700]   or the nation or the army that adapts more quickly to the new technology will often be
[03:19:41.700 --> 03:19:46.260]   the one that wins. And we've seen that story over and over and over again in history.
[03:19:46.260 --> 03:19:50.740]   It's also interesting how much geography that you mentioned a few times
[03:19:50.740 --> 03:19:59.940]   affects wars. The result of wars, the rise and fall of empires, all of it. As silly as it is,
[03:19:59.940 --> 03:20:03.460]   it's not the people or the technology. It's like sometimes like literally that there's rivers.
[03:20:04.100 --> 03:20:10.580]   I think there's a real geographic determinism to civilization itself. I mean, if you look at
[03:20:10.580 --> 03:20:15.940]   where civilization arose, it's in Mesopotamia and sort of a swampy land between two rivers.
[03:20:15.940 --> 03:20:21.540]   It's in the Nile River Delta where the same situation, it's in the Indus River where you
[03:20:21.540 --> 03:20:25.220]   have the same thing and it's along the Yellow Rivers and the Yangtze Rivers where it's the
[03:20:25.220 --> 03:20:31.380]   same thing. So I mean, that is geographically determined where those great civilizations
[03:20:31.380 --> 03:20:38.100]   of Asia or Europe are going to arise. It's very much determined by that.
[03:20:38.100 --> 03:20:45.060]   And often the course of history has that strong geographical determination. I mean,
[03:20:45.060 --> 03:20:52.420]   you can argue that all of Egyptian, ancient Egyptian society is kind of based around the
[03:20:52.420 --> 03:20:57.780]   cycle of the Nile flood because it was so predictable and everything depended on it.
[03:20:57.780 --> 03:21:02.580]   And their whole religion actually develops around that. And in Mesopotamia, the same thing,
[03:21:02.580 --> 03:21:07.620]   the way their religion develops is a reaction to the particular geographic environment
[03:21:07.620 --> 03:21:14.260]   that those people grew up in. So that's a very profound influence on civilization.
[03:21:14.260 --> 03:21:21.140]   One of my professors once said to me, "The best map of the Roman Empire isn't any of these maps
[03:21:21.140 --> 03:21:27.220]   with political borders. It would be a map that shows the zone in which it's possible to cultivate
[03:21:27.220 --> 03:21:33.780]   olives." So if you simply get a map and map onto it where you could grow olives during this time,
[03:21:33.780 --> 03:21:41.940]   let's say 1st century AD, it corresponds exactly, I mean, really closely to the areas that are most
[03:21:41.940 --> 03:21:49.220]   heavily Romanized. Now, I'm not gonna say that... But there is something to that where Roman culture
[03:21:49.220 --> 03:21:55.220]   spreads successfully is where people grow the same crops. And that's just one of those
[03:21:55.220 --> 03:22:01.460]   fundamental things. >> Yeah, I mean, you so beautifully put that the perspective can change
[03:22:01.460 --> 03:22:07.940]   dramatically how you see history. I mean, you could probably tell world history through olives,
[03:22:07.940 --> 03:22:13.060]   cinnamon, and gold. >> Yeah, that's become really trendy to look at history through objects. And I
[03:22:13.060 --> 03:22:20.820]   mean, for the Romans, diet is huge. I mean, probably 80% of the people in their own world ate
[03:22:20.820 --> 03:22:30.660]   basically a diet of olive oil, wine, and wheat, right? That those three crops are the basic crops
[03:22:30.660 --> 03:22:37.300]   that they subsisted on. And just the way you have to grow those crops, where you grow them,
[03:22:37.300 --> 03:22:43.300]   that dictates so much about culture. And the Romans saw it that way. One of my favorite
[03:22:43.300 --> 03:22:48.180]   documents from the ancient world, and they defined civilization that way. So the Romans,
[03:22:48.180 --> 03:22:52.980]   civilized people ate those crops, and non-civilized people ate different food.
[03:22:52.980 --> 03:22:59.860]   So there's this letter from a Greek who was serving as an administrator in the Roman government,
[03:22:59.860 --> 03:23:06.900]   and he gets posted to Germany, okay, to the far north. And he writes these pathetic letters back
[03:23:06.900 --> 03:23:14.020]   home to his family saying, "The inhabitants here lead the most wretched existence of all mankind,
[03:23:14.020 --> 03:23:20.020]   for they cultivate no olives, and they grow no grapes." So to him, that was hell.
[03:23:20.020 --> 03:23:20.500]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[03:23:20.500 --> 03:23:24.020]   >> Being posted to an area where they eat these terrible foreign foods.
[03:23:24.020 --> 03:23:31.060]   And of course, the cliche for the Romans of what barbarians eat is red meat. They're herders,
[03:23:31.060 --> 03:23:35.540]   so they're not farmers, but they follow herds of cow around, which is a totally different lifestyle.
[03:23:35.540 --> 03:23:41.860]   They eat dairy products, and they drink beer. And I tell my students sometimes that if you
[03:23:41.860 --> 03:23:46.980]   were to stick a Roman in a time machine and send him to where we live, which I teach in Wisconsin,
[03:23:46.980 --> 03:23:51.460]   Green Bay, Wisconsin, that Roman would step out, look around, see all the beer,
[03:23:51.460 --> 03:23:56.340]   the brats, and the cheese, and say, "I know who you guys are. You're barbarians."
[03:23:56.340 --> 03:24:01.060]   >> Barbarians. That's another way to draw the boundary between olive oil, wine,
[03:24:01.060 --> 03:24:02.740]   wheat, and meat, dairy, and beer.
[03:24:02.740 --> 03:24:05.860]   >> But it's more fundamental because it's different forms of life.
[03:24:05.860 --> 03:24:06.340]   >> Yeah.
[03:24:06.340 --> 03:24:10.340]   >> Because if you're a farmer, you grow certain crops. And if you're a farmer,
[03:24:10.340 --> 03:24:15.620]   you tend to stay in one place. You tend to build cities. If you're following herds of cows around,
[03:24:15.620 --> 03:24:20.820]   you don't build cities. You have a totally different lifestyle. So it's diet,
[03:24:20.820 --> 03:24:25.060]   but it's more fundamental underlying things about your entire culture.
[03:24:25.060 --> 03:24:28.580]   >> And many of the barbarians were nomadic tribes.
[03:24:28.580 --> 03:24:30.020]   >> Some of them were, yeah, definitely.
[03:24:30.020 --> 03:24:34.500]   >> Fascinating. I mean, this is just yet another fascinating way to-
[03:24:34.500 --> 03:24:38.500]   >> It's a dietary determinism, geographic determinism. Yeah, these things are big.
[03:24:38.500 --> 03:24:45.940]   >> On the topic of war, it may be a ridiculous span of time and scale, but how do you think
[03:24:45.940 --> 03:24:52.580]   the world wars of the 20th century compare to the wars that we've been talking about
[03:24:52.580 --> 03:24:55.060]   of the Roman Empire, of Greece, and so on?
[03:24:55.060 --> 03:25:00.820]   >> I mean, what's interesting about some of the Roman civil wars, particularly,
[03:25:00.820 --> 03:25:07.380]   is that they are world wars at the time. So let's take the war after the assassination of Julius
[03:25:07.380 --> 03:25:12.660]   Caesar. We've talked about that one a lot. There were battles there fought in Spain,
[03:25:12.660 --> 03:25:18.740]   in North Africa, in Greece, in Egypt, in Italy. I mean, truly across the entire breadth of the
[03:25:18.740 --> 03:25:25.460]   Mediterranean involving at least seven or eight different factions of Romans. And that was the
[03:25:25.460 --> 03:25:30.100]   world to them. I mean, that's very similar in a way to our modern world wars, where this was a
[03:25:30.100 --> 03:25:35.380]   global conflict, at least as they envisioned the world they knew of. And if we sort of, I don't
[03:25:35.380 --> 03:25:41.860]   know, somehow factor for transportation time, I mean, I think you can argue that that was a bigger
[03:25:41.860 --> 03:25:48.020]   war than World War II. I mean, in World War II, if you hopped on a plane, you could get from the US
[03:25:48.020 --> 03:25:53.380]   to China in a week or something, right? In little hops. I mean, in the ancient world, if you wanted
[03:25:53.380 --> 03:25:59.780]   to go from Spain to Egypt, it would take you a month. So they were fighting across a larger
[03:25:59.780 --> 03:26:05.540]   space time zone in terms of their technology to move than World War II took place across.
[03:26:05.540 --> 03:26:08.020]   So in some sense, World War II was quite contained.
[03:26:08.020 --> 03:26:13.940]   Smaller. Yeah. I mean, if we adjust for that sort of factor. So that was a global war. I
[03:26:13.940 --> 03:26:19.780]   think that would be very familiar. How do you think the atomic bomb,
[03:26:19.780 --> 03:26:26.580]   nuclear weapons change war? Yeah. I mean, that's the, now we can destroy
[03:26:27.300 --> 03:26:34.180]   the world and truly kind of destroy civilizations wholesale. And that does seem to be a new thing.
[03:26:34.180 --> 03:26:39.860]   I mean, no matter what the Romans did, they didn't have that choice, that ability to think,
[03:26:39.860 --> 03:26:46.740]   "I can do something that will end life as we know it, at least on the planet."
[03:26:46.740 --> 03:26:54.500]   And that's a very different perspective. And it's, I think, weird and interesting moment right now.
[03:26:54.500 --> 03:26:58.500]   I mean, I'm getting way beyond ancient history here, but for a long time, we had this sort of
[03:26:58.500 --> 03:27:05.860]   stasis with the nuclear standoff with mutually assured destruction between the US sort of block
[03:27:05.860 --> 03:27:12.580]   of nations and the Soviet ones. And it worked. And now we're entering this kind of time when
[03:27:12.580 --> 03:27:17.860]   a lot more countries are going to start becoming nuclear capable. We might have a resurgence of
[03:27:17.860 --> 03:27:23.860]   just building new weapons platforms with China. Seems very eager to expand their nuclear arsenal
[03:27:23.860 --> 03:27:29.140]   in all sorts of ways. So, it's a unnerving time, let's say right now.
[03:27:29.140 --> 03:27:35.540]   And it's a terrifying experiment to find out if nuclear weapons, when a lot of nations have
[03:27:35.540 --> 03:27:42.580]   nuclear weapons, is that going to enforce civility and peace or is it actually going to be destabilizing
[03:27:42.580 --> 03:27:46.900]   and ultimately civilization destroying? Right. I mean, it was weirdly stable when
[03:27:46.900 --> 03:27:52.740]   it was a bipolar world where you had just sort of those two blocks. Now with a multipolar world with
[03:27:52.740 --> 03:27:56.580]   access to these weapons, I don't know. I mean, we're kind of jumping out of the ancient world,
[03:27:56.580 --> 03:27:59.700]   but I'll tell you one thing that's always fascinated me in this sort of comparison of
[03:27:59.700 --> 03:28:06.500]   ancient and modern is how people don't learn the lessons of the past in military history.
[03:28:06.500 --> 03:28:13.460]   And the very specific example that in my lifetime I've seen play out twice is just certain places
[03:28:13.460 --> 03:28:19.300]   people make the same mistakes over and over again. So, a nice example is Afghanistan or
[03:28:19.300 --> 03:28:26.180]   roughly that sort of Northern Pakistan slash into what is Afghanistan. I mean, that is a geographic
[03:28:26.180 --> 03:28:34.100]   region that over and over again, the best, most sophisticated armies in the world have invaded
[03:28:34.100 --> 03:28:39.780]   and have met horrible failure. And that goes all the way back to Alexander the Great
[03:28:39.780 --> 03:28:45.060]   tried to conquer that area, the Mongols tried to do it, the Huns tried to do it,
[03:28:45.060 --> 03:28:52.260]   the Mughals tried to do it, Victorian Britain tried to do it, the Russians tried to do it,
[03:28:52.260 --> 03:28:59.060]   the Americans tried to do it, and they made the very same mistakes over and over and over again.
[03:28:59.060 --> 03:29:04.580]   And the two mistakes are not understanding the terrain, that it's a rocky mountainous area
[03:29:04.580 --> 03:29:10.660]   that people can always hide in caves. And it's not understanding the fundamentally tribal nature
[03:29:10.660 --> 03:29:14.740]   of that area, that that's where the real allegiance is, is in these tribes,
[03:29:14.740 --> 03:29:19.540]   it's not in a centralized government. And that's the same error Alexander made as
[03:29:19.540 --> 03:29:26.340]   the British made in the 19th century, as the Russians, as the Americans. And it's just,
[03:29:26.340 --> 03:29:32.500]   it's so depressing as a historian who studies history to see these things being repeated over
[03:29:32.500 --> 03:29:35.540]   and over again, and you know exactly what's going to happen.
[03:29:36.180 --> 03:29:43.060]   For leaders not to be learning lessons of history, you co-wrote a book precisely on this topic,
[03:29:43.060 --> 03:29:48.820]   The Long Shadow of Antiquity, what have the Greeks and Romans done for us?
[03:29:48.820 --> 03:29:54.820]   What are some key elements of antiquity that are reflected in the modern world?
[03:29:54.820 --> 03:29:59.540]   Yeah, it's a book that my wife and I wrote together, and it is trying to
[03:30:02.820 --> 03:30:09.460]   make people understand how deeply rooted our current actions in almost every way,
[03:30:09.460 --> 03:30:16.340]   even things that we think are just truly unique parts of our culture, or things that we think
[03:30:16.340 --> 03:30:20.660]   are just innate to human nature are actually rooted in the past. So there's another power
[03:30:20.660 --> 03:30:26.020]   of the past thing. And this is just a long specific list of examples, really. So I mean,
[03:30:26.020 --> 03:30:30.980]   we go through government and education and intellectual stuff and art and architecture,
[03:30:30.980 --> 03:30:37.300]   and a lot of the things we've been talking about today, language, culture, medicine,
[03:30:37.300 --> 03:30:42.100]   but even things like habits, the way we celebrate things, the way we get married,
[03:30:42.100 --> 03:30:45.300]   our married rituals have all sorts of things in common with Roman weddings.
[03:30:45.300 --> 03:30:46.660]   The calendar.
[03:30:46.660 --> 03:30:51.620]   The calendar, the words. We're using Julius Caesar's calendar. I mean, Pope Gregory did
[03:30:51.620 --> 03:30:55.300]   one tiny little twist, but Caesar's the one who basically came up with our current calendar with
[03:30:55.300 --> 03:31:04.420]   365 days, 12 months, leap years, all that. So we're living in law. There's just no way to escape
[03:31:04.420 --> 03:31:12.020]   the power of the past. And what I believe very ardently is that you can't make good decisions
[03:31:12.020 --> 03:31:17.300]   in the present, and you can't make good decisions about the future without understanding the past.
[03:31:17.300 --> 03:31:21.140]   And that's not just true with your own life, but it's in understanding others.
[03:31:21.140 --> 03:31:24.180]   So it's not only your own past you have to understand, but you have to understand other
[03:31:24.180 --> 03:31:29.220]   people, what's influencing them. So you can't interact with others unless you understand where
[03:31:29.220 --> 03:31:32.900]   they're coming from. And the answer to where they're coming from is where they came from,
[03:31:32.900 --> 03:31:39.060]   and what shaped them, and what forces affect them. So I think it's absolutely vital to have
[03:31:39.060 --> 03:31:45.060]   some understanding of the past in order to make competent decisions in the present.
[03:31:45.060 --> 03:31:51.380]   What are some of the problems when we try to gain lessons from history and look back? We've
[03:31:51.380 --> 03:31:58.580]   spoken about them a bit, the bias of the historian. Maybe what are the problems in
[03:31:58.580 --> 03:32:04.660]   studying history, and how do we avoid them? Probably the biggest problems are
[03:32:04.660 --> 03:32:12.420]   the sources themselves, the incompleteness of them. And this gets more intense the farther
[03:32:12.420 --> 03:32:17.460]   back we go in time. So if you say, "I want to write a book about the 19th century,"
[03:32:18.180 --> 03:32:22.820]   there is more material available for almost any topic you want to pick than you could possibly go
[03:32:22.820 --> 03:32:28.100]   through in your lifetime. If you say, "I want to write a book about the Roman world," this is a
[03:32:28.100 --> 03:32:33.780]   very different thing. In my office, I have a bookshelf that's, I don't know, eight feet high,
[03:32:33.780 --> 03:32:42.500]   10 feet wide, and it contains pretty much all the main surviving Greek and Roman literary texts.
[03:32:43.380 --> 03:32:49.540]   Okay? One bookshelf. It's a big bookshelf. But that's what we use to interpret this world. Now,
[03:32:49.540 --> 03:32:53.940]   there's a lot of other types of texts. There's papyri, there's all sorts of things,
[03:32:53.940 --> 03:32:59.780]   there are inscriptions, there's archaeological evidence. So there's other stuff. But honestly,
[03:32:59.780 --> 03:33:08.500]   99% of things about the world I study are lost. So then you get into all the issues are,
[03:33:10.180 --> 03:33:14.580]   is what we have surviving a representative example? We know it's not. For example,
[03:33:14.580 --> 03:33:20.900]   all the literary texts are written by one tiny group, elite males. So that's a problem there.
[03:33:20.900 --> 03:33:26.100]   There's the problem of bias. We know that they're not necessarily telling us the truth, they have an
[03:33:26.100 --> 03:33:32.100]   agenda. They're representing history in a certain way to achieve certain things. Then there's the
[03:33:32.100 --> 03:33:36.980]   problem of transmission. I mean, all those texts are copies of copies of copies of copies.
[03:33:36.980 --> 03:33:40.820]   And everybody knows that game where you whisper a sentence to someone and then go around the room,
[03:33:40.820 --> 03:33:45.300]   are you gonna get that same sentence back? Well, every ancient text we have has gone through that
[03:33:45.300 --> 03:33:52.100]   process. So this is a real problem. And that's just with the sources, right? And this is the
[03:33:52.100 --> 03:33:58.900]   historic era. When you move back just a little earlier to the prehistoric era or to civilizations
[03:33:58.900 --> 03:34:03.220]   that don't have written sources surviving, and some of these are ancient Mediterranean ones,
[03:34:04.100 --> 03:34:10.420]   I mean, anything goes. I mean, one of the jokes is that museums, archaeological museums are full
[03:34:10.420 --> 03:34:17.620]   of objects which are labeled cult object. It's some religious object. And I think the honest
[03:34:17.620 --> 03:34:22.180]   label that should be on that thing is, we have no idea what the hell this is, but I wanna believe
[03:34:22.180 --> 03:34:27.300]   it's something important. So I'm gonna say it's a religious object, but in reality, it's an ancient
[03:34:27.300 --> 03:34:33.300]   toilet paper roll holder or something. And it's a huge problem when you try to interpret
[03:34:33.300 --> 03:34:40.580]   a civilization without written texts. And my favorite little story that kind of illustrates
[03:34:40.580 --> 03:34:47.380]   this is in the 19th century, this German who had gone to school in England, okay? One of the best
[03:34:47.380 --> 03:34:52.820]   educated guys of his time goes to North Africa and is poking around in the desert. And he finds
[03:34:52.820 --> 03:35:01.060]   this site with these huge stone monoliths, 10 feet tall in pairs. And there's a lintel stone across
[03:35:01.060 --> 03:35:06.580]   the top, so sort of like big two posts with a stone across the top, and there's a big stone in
[03:35:06.580 --> 03:35:12.340]   front of them too. And so he looks at this stuff and he says, "Well, what does this remind me of?
[03:35:12.340 --> 03:35:17.780]   It reminds me of Stonehenge," right? And there's even a site where there's multiple of these
[03:35:17.780 --> 03:35:22.980]   kind of in a square. So he goes back and talks about this, and an Englishman goes and studies
[03:35:22.980 --> 03:35:28.500]   them, and he finds a ton of these sites. And he finds some of them where there's 17 of these pairs.
[03:35:28.500 --> 03:35:32.980]   And so he goes back and he writes a whole book about how clearly the Celtic peoples who once
[03:35:32.980 --> 03:35:37.540]   lived in Britain came originally from North Africa because he's found this site. And he
[03:35:37.540 --> 03:35:42.420]   reconstructs the religion where obviously they practice religious rituals here, and they had
[03:35:42.420 --> 03:35:48.180]   rites of passage, they squeeze between the things. And the altar stones have this basin, so they had
[03:35:48.180 --> 03:35:54.660]   blood sacrifice and all this. And it seemed reasonable. And then you ask some locals, "Well,
[03:35:54.660 --> 03:35:59.220]   what's that stuff out in the desert there?" And they mean, "Oh, the old Roman olive oil factory."
[03:35:59.220 --> 03:36:04.180]   And those are the remains of an olive press. And we're back to olives. I keep dwelling on olives.
[03:36:04.180 --> 03:36:12.020]   Olives don't grow in England or Germany. So this is cultural bias. If all you have
[03:36:12.020 --> 03:36:17.220]   is physical evidence, you're going to interpret that evidence through your own cultural biases.
[03:36:17.220 --> 03:36:21.140]   So if you're an Englishman and you see big stone uprights like this,
[03:36:21.140 --> 03:36:25.140]   you're going to think Stonehenge. If you're from the Mediterranean, you're going to think
[03:36:25.140 --> 03:36:34.500]   olive press. So that's a salutary example, I think, of the dangers of interpreting physical
[03:36:34.500 --> 03:36:40.820]   evidence when you don't have written evidence to go along with it. And think today. If our
[03:36:40.820 --> 03:36:45.700]   civilization were to blow up in a nuclear war and archaeologists were to dig this up,
[03:36:45.700 --> 03:36:53.460]   how might they misinterpret things? I mean, if they were to dig up a college dorm where I work,
[03:36:53.460 --> 03:36:58.100]   and that's what you had for this civilization. You'd probably go in the dorm rooms. You'd find
[03:36:58.100 --> 03:37:03.300]   all these little rooms. And maybe in every room, you'd find this mysterious plastic disc.
[03:37:03.300 --> 03:37:09.060]   And so everybody has these. So it must be a cult object. And it's round. So obviously,
[03:37:09.060 --> 03:37:13.540]   they're sun worshipers. And if you can decipher the inscription, you'll see that obviously,
[03:37:13.540 --> 03:37:19.140]   they all worship the great sun god Wham-O. It's like, what do you find in every dorm room? A
[03:37:19.140 --> 03:37:26.580]   Frisbee. So that's the level of interpretation you have to beware of. And there's examples where
[03:37:26.580 --> 03:37:31.700]   we've done exactly this. So we have to have intellectual humility when we look back into
[03:37:31.700 --> 03:37:38.820]   the past. But hopefully, if you have that without coming up with really strong narratives, if you
[03:37:38.820 --> 03:37:45.460]   look at a large variety of evidence, you can start to construct a picture that somewhat rhymes
[03:37:45.460 --> 03:37:51.700]   with the truth. Yes. I mean, as a professional historian, that's what you do. You attempt to
[03:37:51.700 --> 03:37:59.860]   reconstruct an image of the past that is faithful to the evidence you have as filtered through what
[03:37:59.860 --> 03:38:05.300]   you can perceive of both the biases and the problems of the source material and your own
[03:38:05.300 --> 03:38:11.220]   biases. And it's a interpretation. It's a reconstruction. But it's a lot like science
[03:38:11.220 --> 03:38:15.780]   where you're in a process of constantly reevaluating it and saying, okay, here's some
[03:38:15.780 --> 03:38:21.780]   new evidence. How do I work this into the picture? How do I now adjust it? And that's what's fun. I
[03:38:21.780 --> 03:38:27.780]   mean, it's a mystery. You're being a detective and trying to reconstruct and to understand a
[03:38:27.780 --> 03:38:33.620]   society. And it's even more fun where it's, yeah, you have to try to empathize. Empathy is a great
[03:38:33.620 --> 03:38:39.540]   human thing, to empathize with people who are not yourself. And we should do this all the time with
[03:38:39.540 --> 03:38:43.700]   just the people we encounter, but this is what we're doing with ancient civilizations. And as
[03:38:43.700 --> 03:38:48.100]   I talked about earlier, sometimes you'll feel great sympathy there. Sometimes you'll feel
[03:38:48.100 --> 03:38:53.860]   incomprehension. But by being aware of both of those, you can maybe begin to get some grasp,
[03:38:53.860 --> 03:39:00.820]   however tentative, on the truth as you might perceive it. To ask a ridiculous question,
[03:39:01.460 --> 03:39:08.660]   when our time, you and I, we together, become ancient history, when historians, let's say,
[03:39:08.660 --> 03:39:18.260]   two, three, 4,000 years from now, look back at our time, and like you, try to look at the details
[03:39:18.260 --> 03:39:23.460]   and reconstruct from that the big picture of what was going on, what do you think they'll say?
[03:39:23.460 --> 03:39:27.620]   I would guess it'll be something that's actually more of a commentary on whatever's going on at
[03:39:27.620 --> 03:39:32.420]   that point than on the reality of us, 'cause that's what we tend to do. I'll tell you what
[03:39:32.420 --> 03:39:38.740]   I'd like to have them say, is to say, "In this civilization, I can detect progress." That they
[03:39:38.740 --> 03:39:45.140]   have advanced in some way, whether kind of in moral terms or in self-awareness, or have learned
[03:39:45.140 --> 03:39:48.980]   from what's come before. I mean, that's all you can try and do, is do a little bit better than
[03:39:48.980 --> 03:39:55.620]   whatever came before you, to look back at what happened and try to do something. Livy, I mean,
[03:39:55.620 --> 03:39:59.620]   one of the great Roman historians, at the beginning of his work, A History of Rome,
[03:39:59.620 --> 03:40:05.140]   which is this massive thing, he says, "The utility and the purpose of history is this,
[03:40:05.140 --> 03:40:10.580]   it provides you an infinite variety of experiences and models,
[03:40:10.580 --> 03:40:18.100]   noble things to imitate and shameful things to avoid." And I think he's right.
[03:40:18.100 --> 03:40:25.140]   And they would perhaps be better at highlighting which shameful things we started avoiding and
[03:40:25.140 --> 03:40:30.180]   which noble things we started imitating. With the perspective of history, they'll be able to
[03:40:30.180 --> 03:40:37.700]   identify, or maybe with the bias of the historians of the time. Well, in that grand perspective,
[03:40:37.700 --> 03:40:41.940]   what gives you hope about our future as a humanity, as a civilization?
[03:40:41.940 --> 03:40:50.340]   We have curiosity. I think curiosity is a great thing, that you wanna learn something new.
[03:40:50.340 --> 03:40:56.100]   I think the human impulse to wanna learn new stuff is one of our best characteristics.
[03:40:56.100 --> 03:41:01.300]   And at least up to this point, what makes us special is the ability to store up
[03:41:01.300 --> 03:41:05.220]   an accumulation of knowledge and to pass that knowledge on to the next generation.
[03:41:05.220 --> 03:41:10.340]   I mean, that's really all we are. We're the accumulation of the knowledge of infinite
[03:41:10.340 --> 03:41:15.460]   generations that have come before us. And everything we do is based on that. Otherwise,
[03:41:15.460 --> 03:41:21.940]   we'd all just be starting at ground zero just from the beginning. So our ability to store up
[03:41:21.940 --> 03:41:28.500]   knowledge and pass it on, I think, is our special power as human beings. And I think our curiosity
[03:41:28.500 --> 03:41:32.740]   is what keeps us going forward. >> I agree. And for that,
[03:41:32.740 --> 03:41:37.540]   I thank you for being one of the most wonderful examples of that, of you yourself being a curious
[03:41:37.540 --> 03:41:42.260]   being and emanating that throughout and inspiring a lot of other people to be curious by being out
[03:41:42.260 --> 03:41:46.900]   there in the world and teaching. So thank you for that, and thank you for talking today.
[03:41:46.900 --> 03:41:49.620]   >> No, enjoyed it. It's fun. I obviously like talking about this stuff.
[03:41:49.620 --> 03:41:56.740]   >> Thanks for listening to this conversation with Gregory Aldrete. To support this podcast,

[03:42:01.940 --> 03:42:11.700]   Julius Caesar, "I came, I saw, I conquered." Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:42:11.860 --> 03:42:12.440]   [END]
[03:42:12.440 --> 03:42:17.880]   Julius Caesar, "I came, I saw, I conquered." Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
