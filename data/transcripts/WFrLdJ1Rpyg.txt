[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   Hi there, my name is Jeremy Howard. I'm a data scientist at the University of San Francisco.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.880]   I specialize mainly in medical data and recently I had the opportunity to present to a group of,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.120]   I think entirely or nearly entirely epidemiologists at the World Health Organization who were looking
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.760]   at guidelines for mask wearing and I've had a lot of interest expressed in seeing the slides and the
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.080]   arguments that I put up to the World Health Organization in that so I thought I would share
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.720]   them with you here today. So I am part of an organization called Masks for All which is a
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.880]   group of volunteers. We're all scientists from many different areas of science, many different
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.760]   parts of the world and we've all spent a lot of time studying the science around community mask
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.400]   wearing and trying to communicate that to the public and to policymakers such as the World Health
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:03.520]   Organization. The World Health Organization has recently released some guidelines that have
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:13.280]   recommended using cloth masks in public or non-medical masks in public and we would actually
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.240]   like to see them go further with their recommendations and make them stronger and change them in some
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.000]   ways but perhaps more importantly one of the things I really focused on was a need to change
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.400]   the kind of evidence that epidemiologists tend to look at for public health interventions like
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.600]   mask wearing, governments and obviously in this case the World Health Organization. So the WHO
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.800]   actually sponsored a study which was what's called a meta-analysis where it's basically
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   a study of other studies so this is the one here true at L which was published in the Lancet
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:01.200]   and what we realized is that actually this review which the WHO used quite heavily has
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.480]   a bunch of problems. The first most obvious ones is that outside of hospitals they only actually
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.160]   looked at three studies so that's what they call non-healthcare settings and in fact two of those
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.440]   studies had major problems. The first is that this one here Lao et al actually is not a study of
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.640]   community or household use of masks at all it was actually a study of the use of masks in hospitals
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:34.320]   during hospital visits. And then the second study with a big problem is Tuon et al which actually
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.800]   showed that in this case out of the nine groups that wore masks none of them got sick but it was
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.600]   so underpowered there were so few people in this study that the review used a number here that
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.080]   basically claimed that masks make you more likely to be infected not less likely even though
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.920]   actually nobody got sick who wore a mask in that study. Basically because there were so few infected
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.040]   people in the study overall it was kind of a statistical aberration as it were. So the only
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.520]   one which really studied community mask use was this one Wu et al which actually the number they
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   used includes families where some people weren't wearing masks. So if you just actually include
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.640]   the ones where they were there was a only there was basically a 70% reduction in risk in the
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:33.680]   households that used masks. The study also looked at mask use in hospitals and this is the table
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.880]   that they included but actually only three of the studies in this case were of COVID-19 and in fact
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.320]   I should mention none of the studies in non-healthcare were of COVID-19 they were all of SARS 1.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:56.400]   And the three healthcare studies of COVID-19 actually showed over 95% decrease in risk amongst
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.520]   those using masks in healthcare but they basically did the statistical analysis in a very strange way
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.840]   maybe not strange very common way but not really appropriate for this which is that they assumed
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:17.680]   that SARS, MERS and COVID-19 all had the same profile in terms of what do masks do and as a
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:26.800]   result they gave these three studies really low weights 0.9%, 0.9% and 1.7%. So even though the
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.520]   risk reduction from using masks for COVID-19 in all three cases was was huge those studies were
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:43.040]   basically ignored in this meta-analysis. There is one analysis actually of wearing masks in
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.440]   households for COVID-19 which is this one here and in this case there was a about an 80% reduction
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.160]   in risk in the households that wore masks so that's that's good you know it's a it's a pretty
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.240]   strong study it's not huge you know it's it we would love to see a bigger version of it but it's
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.600]   a it's a start. The problem is though that for all of these kinds of studies they're very hard
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.920]   to interpret because you know when you're trying to say what's the impact of wearing a mask on
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.920]   transmission if I wear a mask my hope is that I'm you know if I'm sick and I don't know it that I
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.840]   won't pass on that sickness to other people. So how do you know if me wearing a mask stopped
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.120]   other people from getting sick? You don't really right because people who come across me wearing
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.240]   my mask will have come across lots of other people as well so if they do get sick was it because a
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.200]   sickness got through my mask or was it because they came in contact with somebody else who was sick?
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.960]   Who knows right so the only way to study that properly really would be to actually have like
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.320]   50 cities where everybody in those cities were told not to wear masks and 50 cities where everybody
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.920]   was told they have to wear masks and then get compliance to work and then compare them and that
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.040]   would be basically logistically and ethically impossible. So in fact the epidemiology and
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.120]   evidence-based healthcare communities have started to realize it well I shouldn't say started to
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.480]   actually for decades have realized this but have particularly been talking about this as being an
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.720]   issue for COVID-19 which is that population health interventions like tell everybody to wear a mask
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.560]   end up being implemented as natural experiments and their evaluation is more complex than a
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.880]   randomized controlled trial that's just the way it is you know we can't hope to find an RCT a
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.720]   randomized controlled trial for a public health intervention like this because it's just not
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.520]   ethical or logistically possible to do. So that was in BMG Journal of Epidemiology and Community
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.960]   Health in Pillow West Medicine Trish Greenhouse said something similar upstream preventative public
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.600]   health interventions aimed at supporting widespread and sustained behavior change across the whole
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:05.280]   population like masks rarely lend themselves to a controlled on versus off intervention design
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.160]   randomized controlled trial style design. So the reason I pointed this out to the World Health
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.440]   Organization was to kind of say look these are the kinds of studies that most epidemiologists
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.600]   are used to studying that you all want to study but they're just not going to happen
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.400]   for this right and so you actually have to look at a wider field of evidence.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.040]   So this is what we did we being this group of 19 scientists including epidemiologists and
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.440]   biostatisticians and aerosol scientists and sociologists lots of different folks we all got
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:46.080]   together to study the evidence across a much wider evidence base than just traditional
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:52.960]   epidemiological evidence and so we ended up with I think 155 references might even be more now
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.880]   and that became the most viewed paper ever of any kind on preprints.org.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:05.440]   And you know one of the things we looked at in this paper is that we now have a lot of these
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:11.680]   natural experiments which is that over 80% of the world now lives in regions that require
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.640]   masks. Furthermore in countries like for example in the US over 70% of the population has to wear
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:27.200]   masks in the US because of state or city specific mandates but back in early to mid-March only 10
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.720]   countries required masks. So this change means that we can actually look at kind of the before
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.320]   versus after effects of what happens when countries bring in or when in the case of
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:46.880]   the US for example states bring in mask requirements. So a paper from Loeffler et al looked at nearly
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.320]   200 countries and you have to be very careful right because often when people bring in a
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.240]   mask mandate a country brings in a mask mandate they'll do a bunch of other things at around the
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.880]   same time they might have a lockdown at around that time they might have school closures at around
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:07.680]   that time. So statisticians have to use multivariate analysis to try to account for these
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.120]   confounders which Loeffler's paper for example did they looked at 10 different policy health
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.680]   interventions all the ones tracked by Oxford across as well as lots of demographic geographic
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:24.720]   and so forth confounders as well. And they found that countries that did not wear masks
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   when you look at kind of the number of days since the start of the infection or the outbreak in that
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:36.800]   country after a couple of months that we had huge outbreaks normalized per million population
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:46.400]   countries where masks were required within 15 days of the initial infection had basically no
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.960]   infection at all and those that required them in the first 16 to 30 days had a bit of an outbreak
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:00.080]   but they quickly got it under control. So this is a super interesting data obviously and we see
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.160]   something very similar in a paper by Lewin Waby which is this one here which is that mask mandates
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:15.520]   in the US very similar result are associated with a 2 percentage point decrease in COVID-19 growth
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:23.840]   rate 2 percentage points a day that's enormous after 21 days after signing. So they guessed
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:32.480]   that by late May somewhere around 200 to 400,000 cases had been averted. So these are often
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:42.320]   called ecological studies and they're super unpopular amongst many in the epidemiological
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:49.040]   community there's this idea of this thing called the ecological fallacy which many people misinterpret
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.880]   as meaning you can't generate any understanding of population behavior or the underlying individual
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.520]   behavior of those populations by looking at population data. But actually data scientists
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.560]   and statisticians and machine learning folks have actually been studying exactly that for many,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.960]   many decades and in fact there's another paper called the fallacy of the ecological fallacy
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.720]   which is to say basically the ecological fallacy is this kind of grab bag of multiple different
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.000]   issues which for which there are ways to deal with them. So we should be very careful not to
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.560]   throw away these vitally important studies it's vitally important information because it's really
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.480]   the only kind of data direct data that we can get about the impact of these population health
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:38.080]   interventions. We can however get lab data and in some ways this is kind of the strongest and most
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.640]   obvious because you can actually literally see here's an example of somebody speaking
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.080]   and this researcher when they're speaking you can see that little tiny droplets come flying out of
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.080]   their mouth and thanks to the use of this laser scattering chamber we can actually see them.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:00.720]   Normally you can't they're too small to see these can be around 10 microns in size in terms of what's
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.160]   visualized here and you can see here they're holding a paper towel over their face just a
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.560]   normal paper towel and when they do almost all of the droplets are blocked it looks like there's two
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:19.120]   got through. Now of course you can see he's holding it quite carefully here which obviously
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.320]   if you're using a paper towel or a cloth mask you want it to be as nicely tightly fitting as possible
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:32.560]   but the basic idea is that yeah you know as you would expect a physical barrier blocks this
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:38.240]   physical thing which is the droplets that transmit the virus so we can very directly see
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:46.480]   the way a mask does in fact stop this vector of transmission this key vector of transmission.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.960]   So why do we focus on speech droplets? Well the reason we focus on speech droplets is
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:59.280]   this is a respiratory infection so how does this respiratory infection get transmitted through
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.320]   stuff coming out of your mouth and nose. One way for that to happen is sneezes
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.880]   and we really haven't looked at sneezes much because that is a symptom and so people who
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:16.720]   are symptomatic hopefully are staying home. Another is breathing but breathing is mainly
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.400]   going to bring up drop very tiny droplets from your lower respiratory tract which actually it
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:29.360]   turns out is something where the disease kind of appears later on again after you have symptoms.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:36.400]   So what we mainly care about is the upper respiratory tract viral shedding and this
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:42.880]   comes out in speech droplets so this is why we're particularly interested in speech droplets because
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.600]   these are the ones that people who are walking around don't even know they're sick are rejecting
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:58.080]   from their mouth. So one of the key things to realize this is not just for speech droplets but
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:05.680]   particularly so is that on average a wet particle with one variant will be about 27 microns across
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:13.040]   which is pretty giant compared to the size of the virus but what happens is after it comes out of
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:21.200]   your mouth it rapidly evaporates down to in this case it would be down to about 5 microns in size.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.320]   There's a whole range of droplet sizes but the key is that they will evaporate and become smaller
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.880]   and so when they come out of your mouth they're moving straight forward straight into the fabric
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.360]   they're pretty big the atmosphere inside your mask is very humid because of your breathing
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:44.000]   and so it hits then this large droplet hits the fabric of your mask and soaks into it so it
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.840]   doesn't go through and then once it becomes much smaller after evaporation if you're not
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:56.240]   wearing a mask it can float in the air and as it does so it now also doesn't have that direct
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.800]   trajectory so it's also much easier for it to squeeze through the gaps above or around your mask
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.120]   so it's much easier to do what's called source control which is blocking it on the way out and
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:18.240]   this is why we focus on this idea my mask protects you your mask protects me. Now some aerosol some
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.680]   tiny droplets maybe from breathing are also important in transmission we don't really know
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.360]   for sure we suspect maybe not so much for the folks that don't have symptoms yet but even if
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:36.560]   the breathing droplets are important as well we actually know from a study that the basic cloth
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:45.040]   masks are actually about the most effective at stopping both the the direct coming through the
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   front and through coming out the sides breath because cloth masks can often be like larger
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:57.120]   cover more of the face and there also can be more absorbent so you know we shouldn't assume
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:04.000]   that cloth masks are less effective than other masks or most importantly we shouldn't assume
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.080]   that they're not effective at all the lab data we have suggests they are and also remember that
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.520]   most of those countries that now require masks which covers the vast majority of the world's
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.560]   population aren't using medical masks because they're not available so the results we're seeing
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:29.200]   in practice are from people who are largely wearing simple unfitted masks. So how long does
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:35.840]   that droplet cloud stay in the air for well this study showed that when you again look at this
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:42.400]   laser scattering chamber and you look at the speech droplets that come out they after coming
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.960]   out of the mouth at minute zero after about 10 minutes about half of them have fallen to the
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.880]   ground and after 20 minutes maybe three quarters have but you can see there's still a large droplet
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.800]   cloud even 20 minutes after somebody speaks so these droplets if they're not blocked on the way
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:08.960]   out they can actually hang around for quite a long time. A fluid dynamics study found something
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.720]   pretty similar about the effect of masks which is that if you don't wear a mask your droplet cloud
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:22.480]   can go out beyond two meters where else with a mask it really is well contained you can see with
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:28.640]   a mask a little bit of it goes backwards but the actual radius of the cloud is much smaller.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:38.080]   So how much is this impact of the size of the rejection in size of the droplet cloud
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.360]   so a study in physics of fluids found that the amount of reduction in size of the droplet cloud
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:50.480]   depends a lot on what kind of mask you're wearing all kinds of mask at least made it at least
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.360]   half the radius but a stitched mask with cotton was the most effective in terms of getting it
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:05.520]   down to just 2.5 inches in this study. So one of the interesting things is that since a mask can
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.720]   make the droplet cloud smaller that means that social distancing becomes more helpful becomes
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.920]   more important because you're not as likely to infect somebody six feet away. Another reason
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:22.320]   that there's a great impact on social distancing is that a study found that people who didn't wear
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:30.400]   masks people tended to stay closer to them than people who did wear masks. So in other words when
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.160]   you see somebody wearing a mask there's this conscious or unconscious thing going on where
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:40.480]   people actually keep their distance away from you more. I guess maybe it's this like reminder of
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.760]   like oh this is a pandemic there's somebody in a mask you know I should I should keep her a healthy
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:56.400]   distance. So that's interesting because some folks have claimed including the WHO that wearing a mask
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:02.960]   could reduce to less could result in less social distancing but the data we have doesn't support
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:09.440]   that at all it seems populations that wear masks have dramatically less transmission it seems that
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.080]   the effect on social distancing is much better because of the reduced droplet cloud size
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:21.360]   and that people may even keep their distance more. In terms of children which is particularly
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   important right now schools seem like a particularly important place to wear masks it's it's somewhere
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:34.880]   where people talk a lot and so therefore a lot of speech droplets in places like Sweden where they
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:41.520]   didn't close the schools kids had just as high an infection rate in in seroprevalence studies as
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:47.360]   adults did so it seems like when you don't close schools kids become infected often and then they
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.480]   go on to pass on those infections to adults even though the kids themselves rarely get seriously
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:59.680]   sick it seems that they just as often or maybe nearly just as often pass on that sickness to
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:07.600]   adults and so for example in Victoria the largest outbreak in the whole state came from a school
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.880]   in Israel there was massive outbreaks around the country both Victoria and Israel are both places
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:19.520]   where COVID-19 was almost under control and they reopened schools and things got totally out of
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:26.320]   control and in fact you know it when you look at the viral loads in kids they tend to be pretty
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:35.520]   similar to the viral loads in in adults. So one of the things that we talked about is is this idea
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.720]   of likely harms the World Health Organization currently has a list of likely harms under the
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:47.440]   section around community mask use. So some of the likely harms that we've heard about a lot and seen
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.800]   in the World Health Organization's guidelines don't really seem likely at all in fact some of them
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:58.000]   seem like likely benefits rather than likely harms and for example there's a claim that there could
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.720]   be a increased risk of self-contamination but actually it's much more likely you would see a
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:09.360]   decreased risk a mouth covers the mouth and nose making it much harder to touch them and so there
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.320]   has been some studies of this it does need more research but the evidence we have suggests that
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:20.640]   maybe this is a benefit rather than a harm. There's also a claim in the guidelines that there's a risk
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:28.160]   of droplet transmission and it splashes to the eyes which is true of course but that is not the
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.840]   result of mask wearing that's just like oh also guys cover up our eyes. So it's kind of strange
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:41.520]   to me that there are these that you know official health bodies like the WHO include these likely
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:50.400]   harms when they're not likely or harms necessarily or related to wearing a mask it's it's really odd
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:57.600]   to I don't really know what's going on here. There's a claim often including the WHO guidelines
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:04.240]   that there could be a likely to be a false sensor security but there's actually no data supporting
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:12.080]   that and in fact it was claimed over a hundred years ago and it's never been demonstrated. So
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:19.360]   this is just this kind of speculative well maybe it might happen. So I think we've got to be very
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.920]   careful of when you see somebody saying here are some likely harms is to say like do we have any
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.800]   evidence of that is there any data to support that is there any lab evidence of that or is this just
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.800]   an assertion which somebody's just made up and could could the opposite be equally true.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:45.840]   The other issue with the WHO guidelines is that it it lists some suggested types or a particular
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:53.920]   type of mask based on a table of mask filtration levels and actually the the advice is based on
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:03.920]   studies which don't use the right kind of approach. In particular they look at particle sizes of 72
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:10.240]   nanometers. Now that's very very small very small and much smaller than the five microns we talked
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:17.840]   about and in fact it's it's very hard to even come up with a droplet smaller than one micron
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:24.400]   that can both hold together you know at all and actually contain a very on a virus particle.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:32.080]   So the particle size that's being studied but in the WHO table is way smaller than we would expect
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.760]   to ever need to filter in practice particularly for source control. So when it's coming out
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:45.600]   as we discussed it's larger than when it's coming in. So you know that's a much smaller
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:51.840]   particle than we actually think you should be looking at. Furthermore they used a flow rate
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.040]   so the amount of particle you know the amount of gas going through the machine that they were
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:02.960]   testing with was was much higher than you would have in real life when you're kind of
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:10.320]   sitting or walking slowly or something like this. So in fact the the particle sizes and flow rates
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:19.120]   they used are based on the testing criteria for masks as protective equipment for health care
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:25.360]   workers which is like worst case situation not really that appropriate for for community use.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:33.760]   Also they didn't actually test the best materials and so there there are actually tests of materials
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:40.800]   that that you can buy from Amazon or the local shop or whatever which are orders of magnitude
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.360]   more effective than the ones that that they talked about and even recommended in their guidelines.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:51.520]   So I think it's a waste that they're not actually pointing out that there are much better materials
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:59.680]   available. They also didn't touch on the best designs for ensuring a good fit. Again I think
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.920]   that's a real shame for example this rubber mask brace or this approach I'm wearing here of just
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:16.560]   three rubber bands were shown to surpass the N95 fit test so the kind of health care medical worker
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:31.920]   fit test in in most situations that this study looked at. So there are a lot of crafters now
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:37.840]   working with you know great materials and great designs for example on Etsy if you look for face
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.960]   masks with a moldable nose wire and an insertable filter where you can put these really great
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:52.160]   filter materials there's over 69,000 different shops where you can buy these from kind of DIY
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:59.280]   crafters. So you know we I think it's good it would be great if public health bodies can
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.560]   try and provide this information about what are the best approaches and and realize that they are
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:14.720]   available. Okay so that's it for my little summary of what we talked about and what I presented to
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:20.640]   the World Health Organization on community mask wearing and I hope you found that helpful. Thanks
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.600]   for watching.
