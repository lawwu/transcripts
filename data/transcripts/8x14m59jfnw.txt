[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   All right, so anyways, we got good questions.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.440]   Before we get into the questions, though,
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.560]   like I often like to do to start these episodes,
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.840]   I like to kick things off with what I call a deep dive
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.640]   where I take a query that's been on my mind for a long time
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.700]   and spend some time with it.
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.400]   So the topic of the deep dive
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   that I'm going to get into today
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.400]   is will four-day weeks solve burnout?
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.520]   Now, one of the motivations was,
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.040]   there's been a lot of articles about it.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.680]   This is an article that's on the screen now
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.560]   for people who are watching.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.360]   It's actually from February,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000]   but it's one of many articles like this
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.680]   that I've come across recently
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.000]   that are talking about the increased popularity
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.740]   for the last year or two
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.920]   in the idea of knowledge workers in particular
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.480]   doing four-day workweeks,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.440]   so typically Monday through Thursday
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160]   instead of Monday through Friday.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.120]   Now, it's not an idea that is brand new.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.680]   In "Deep Work," which I published back in 2016,
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.040]   I talked about the four-day workweek experiments
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.320]   at Basecamp.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.520]   They then were and continue to do today.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.240]   A part of the year is four-day workweeks of the summer,
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.640]   and I got into some of those details in that book.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.640]   Alex Peng had a well-timed book out called "Shorter"
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.620]   that was all about this concept that came out,
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.680]   and this is where I say well-timed, March of 2020.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.320]   So that book was right there for people
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.240]   during the pandemic-induced remote work
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.520]   where we began rethinking how we might structure our efforts.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.000]   That book was well-timed to be there.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.720]   So this idea has been around.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.560]   Last year or two, though, it's gotten a lot more attention.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.340]   The pandemic pushed it to the forefront.
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520]   So if we look at this particular sample article
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.880]   I have on the screen, this is from "Wired" from February
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.300]   written by Caitlin Harrigan,
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.000]   we see it talks about this concept.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.600]   It notes that several trials or trials have been launched
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.840]   in several countries in the past few months.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.040]   So this is something that has been happening
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.800]   over the last year or two is countries,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.580]   government funding studies from countries
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.200]   are looking into this, where they'll take a bunch of companies
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.440]   and temporarily move them to four-day weeks
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.360]   and then interview the employees afterwards
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.520]   about was this better, was this not?
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.760]   So there's a lot of these investigations
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.920]   going on typically in Europe.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.760]   Iceland was one of the first countries to do this.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.440]   They actually had results back.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.320]   Spoiler alert, people like the four-day work week there.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.440]   In this particular "Wired" article,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.540]   they went and talked to 15 workers at six tech companies
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.120]   that had already adopted a shortened work week
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.620]   and found that employees generally approved.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.360]   So that's the actual quote I have up here,
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.640]   but some saw it as a mixed blessing.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.220]   All right, so here's the question.
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.500]   Is this highly visible intervention
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   a good solution to the burnout
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.500]   that knowledge workers increasingly feel?
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.860]   My argument has been no.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.920]   I do not think shifting to the four-day work week
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.240]   is going to be a long-term or sustainable solution
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.260]   to a lot of the actual valid concerns
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.240]   that people have about work, its role in their life,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.760]   and the stress and burnout that it is creating.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.040]   I think by contrast,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.540]   the issue might be the notion of a work week in general,
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.460]   not its length.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.480]   So let's go back and think about
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.240]   where the concept of a standardized work week came from.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.120]   In the US, it comes from the Fair Labor Standards Practice.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.400]   In 1938, this is the Prussian-era legislation.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.100]   It established 40 hours as a standard work week
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.060]   for many industries.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.000]   In other words, if you wanted to have an employee
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.440]   work longer than 40 hours,
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.420]   they would have to be paid overtime.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.000]   This very much largely concerned
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.160]   manufacturing and industrial jobs,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.640]   jobs where there was an hourly component to the work,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.520]   jobs where the biggest knob you had to turn
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.180]   in terms of impacting the difficulty of the work
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.840]   was how many hours people were actually working.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.340]   This was the context for something
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.200]   like a standardized work week made sense.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.380]   Knowledge workers have been relatively exempt
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.440]   from that law because it is a different type of situation.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.480]   Knowledge work is way more autonomous.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.200]   The number of hours you are working or expected to work
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.540]   don't necessarily mean a lot
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.720]   in a lot of knowledge work jobs.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's very outcomes-based.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.080]   You're given work, you're expected to accomplish the work.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.200]   The work week is at best a loose framework
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.480]   for roughly speaking,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.920]   when you might be expected to be available for meetings,
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.840]   when we might expect a response to emails,
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.740]   and when we might not.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.440]   So, okay, we don't work on the weekends,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.740]   then we can't schedule a meeting on the weekend.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.560]   We don't schedule meetings at 8 p.m. typically
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.320]   because we have this rough work week, but that's about it.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.160]   There's no notion of, wait a second,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.320]   I'm only supposed to work 32 hours
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.180]   and I'm just at the assembly line
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.420]   turning the crank until those 32 hours are up.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.280]   So in knowledge work, the work week is, again,
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.360]   just a loose framework for setting certain expectations,
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.680]   not the core defining factor of the efforts
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.820]   that you actually are going to execute.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.800]   All right, so what should we do?
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.500]   If knowledge workers feel burnt out,
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.200]   what type of things are gonna make a difference?
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.720]   One of my big arguments is that more transparent
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.000]   and humane systems for work assignment,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.280]   execution, and review is what is critical.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.520]   Moving past the haphazardness
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.120]   with which we just toss work around
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.440]   in the knowledge work environment today,
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.960]   where anyone at any time can just say,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.000]   hey, take a look at this, can you do this?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.540]   Do this meeting, take care of this problem.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.420]   What are your thoughts on this?
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.200]   Just with an email or a conversation in the hallway
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.640]   or a Slack message, work can be dropped on anyone's plate
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.840]   by anyone at any time without anyone tracking
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.920]   how much are you doing?
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.320]   Does it make sense for you to do more?
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.600]   Does it make sense what it is that you're working on?
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.640]   When are you gonna work on this?
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.320]   What do you need to actually get this done?
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.260]   We don't have any of those conversations.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.360]   We plug people into the cybernetic hive mind
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.260]   of Slack and email and Zoom and say, get after it.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.800]   And we end up with these completely overloaded task lists
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.520]   and ambiguity and stress, and I could care less
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.800]   if you tell me that my work week
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.280]   is supposed to end on Thursday or not.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.200]   I have all this stuff, I have to get it done.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.440]   So we need more humane and transparent systems.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.560]   Here's how we keep track of what you're working on.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.920]   We can see it.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.820]   Here's how much we think you should have on your plate
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.660]   at any one time.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.400]   You have too much, you get nothing more.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.160]   Here is how we think you should actually execute the work.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.600]   Well, this is what the mornings are for.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.200]   These days are all just concentration.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.760]   Meetings can only happen at these places.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.000]   Transparency, so we can see the system
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.840]   and see the workloads.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.080]   And humanity, which I mean, you are trying to align
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.020]   these systems to the way that the human brain
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.860]   actually functions.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.220]   That's the reform we need.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.220]   Ours is a knob that's relevant for the factory.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.640]   Task assignment systems.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.320]   That is the relevant knob for knowledge work.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.360]   And there's all sorts of ideas here.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.320]   Like poll systems is something I've advocated for.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.680]   They do this in software, we could do this other places.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.200]   Let me work on one thing at a time.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.120]   When I'm done, I'll pull in a new thing.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   And you know what, my team or my boss or my supervisor
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.360]   can be involved in deciding on what that next thing
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.520]   should be, but I do one thing at a time.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.080]   You cannot just throw things on my plate
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.640]   and have me organize it.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.000]   I work on one thing at a time.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.800]   We need a systemic collection mechanism
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.240]   for actually keeping track of all the things
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.240]   the company needs to do.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.480]   Shouldn't it just be in my inbox?
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.520]   Shouldn't it just be on my task list?
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.080]   Protocols and processes that everyone agrees on,
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.120]   that's blessed by the head of the company,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.940]   the head of your team.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.840]   Protocols and processes for how regular
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.200]   ongoing work happens.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.880]   This is the process we meet at these days.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.080]   There's office hours you come into for short questions.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.280]   Here's what email can and can't be used for.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.820]   Again, just rock and rolling.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.580]   Here's the tools, here's your handle,
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.660]   here's your address, go for it, doesn't work.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.760]   Protocols and processes.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.200]   In general, trading accountability
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.400]   for this accessibility that we've come to expect
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.360]   is what we would also wanna get out of this.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   So forget this, like let's just make everyone accessible
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.400]   and we'll sort of figure things out
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.840]   and make accountability be the new buzzword.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.400]   We agreed what you're gonna do, did you do it?
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.260]   How well did you do it?
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.840]   What hours you did it, what days you did it, I don't care.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.040]   That's not my business.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.520]   That is something we could be moving towards.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.400]   I think that's more natural for the type of work
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.880]   that we're doing in the knowledge sector.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.320]   Let me throw out one more radical idea here.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.440]   I don't think talking about the nature of the work week
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.160]   is that important, but I am kind of interested
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.480]   in talking about the nature of the work year.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.320]   And I'm gonna get into this a little bit later in the show,
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.940]   but we assume that the ideal work year
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.940]   for a knowledge worker is you work all year,
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.560]   with the exception of maybe a vacation week
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.960]   here or vacation week there.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.800]   I think we need way more variety there.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.480]   I mean, imagine a world in which there were alternatives.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.640]   My engagement with this company is six months a year.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.280]   My engagement for this company is,
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.000]   it's eight months and four months off.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.040]   My engagement is 11 months and I take one full month off.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.200]   I mean, imagine if you had these different options
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.240]   and you had salaries adjusted and matching
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.400]   these different configurations,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.040]   giving people way more flexibility
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.220]   in how they actually structure their lives.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.160]   This could be a big thing.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.880]   And I've asked this question before,
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.040]   and I think the answer is interesting.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.200]   How many people today, if you said,
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.760]   would you be willing to take 10/12 of your current salary
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.280]   if you didn't have to work in the summer?
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.520]   A lot of people say, of course.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   I will go from whatever, 150,000 to 125,000,
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.960]   130,000, however the math works out there.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.200]   I guess it's 120,000 there.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.400]   If I also don't have to work in July and August.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.080]   Like that type of flexibility, we don't think about it,
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.880]   but it's another way to think about burnout,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.000]   especially with jobs where when you're doing the work,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.520]   it's incredibly intense.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.520]   I mean, if I'm McKinsey or WilmerHale law firm,
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.960]   and like our whole model is bringing in
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.160]   incredibly smart people to work on these engagements
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.720]   that are incredibly demanding.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.520]   We're trying to monetize their brains.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.160]   You're probably gonna have a lot more sustainability
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.440]   if you had these different options.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.400]   Yeah, here's someone who's gonna come work
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.480]   for eight months and then take four
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.280]   where they're not working,
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.160]   and recharging and doing other sorts of things.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.640]   You're gonna probably keep that employee around
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.720]   for a lot longer than saying, look,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.120]   we're doing a hundred hour weeks until your ears bleed.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.440]   So I'll throw that out there too.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.040]   All right, so I think those are the type of solutions
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.300]   that matter for knowledge work burnout.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.300]   So why is there so much energy behind the four jobs
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.340]   for day work week?
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.800]   Let's go back to that Wired article,
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.620]   and I think we can see some clues.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.180]   All right, so quoting an employee
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.480]   from one of the companies that this reporter talked to,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.860]   said this strategy shows that the company really does care.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.360]   The reporter goes on to say this arrangement
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   is a boon for businesses because you curry goodwill
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.360]   without raising pay, without decreasing workload.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.980]   So this is what I think is going on with this.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.260]   It's signaling, right?
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.460]   Oh, we care about our employees.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.420]   We're doing radical things.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.260]   This sounds radical.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.820]   We're dropping a whole day off the work week.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.980]   Even if what it really means is you do the same amount
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.300]   of work, you just maybe aren't allowed
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.700]   to schedule meetings on one day,
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.520]   but you have to do more work on the other day,
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.500]   and they feel more packed.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.980]   You end up in the same place, right?
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.580]   It doesn't really change much.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.380]   Like, look, we have no systematic way
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.140]   of tracking what you're supposed to be working on,
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.340]   what's a reasonable workload.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.280]   That's not gonna change.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.020]   Your workload's not gonna change.
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.420]   We don't have a system where we can turn that down by 20%.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.580]   So yeah, we'll tell you you get Fridays off.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.500]   Same stuff gets done.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.940]   We look like we are being progressive,
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.300]   and I think they've done a pretty good job of selling this.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.020]   They give a lot of more reform-minded commentators
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.980]   or journalists, especially on Twitter,
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.180]   who are like, "This seems big.
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.940]   "I like the idea of making a big change."
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.580]   They feel like it's sticking it to the companies,
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.820]   and that feels good, but it's not really.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.780]   The whole thing, I think, is a PR exercise.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.760]   We need real solutions, and real solutions requires us
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.340]   to get to the very nature of how work actually happens
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.180]   in knowledge work.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.420]   I don't care how many hours you tell me my work week is.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.000]   I don't install tires on an assembly line.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.860]   What I do is way more annoying and frustrating
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.760]   and vague and ambiguous.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.820]   So you can keep your four-day work week,
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.060]   and let's talk about how you actually assign tasks,
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.100]   how much I should be working on,
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.700]   what are our protocols, what are our systems?
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.980]   So let's see.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.820]   There you go.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.640]   So we'll see.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.380]   If you're interested, this is the type of thing I get into
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.820]   in my most recent book, "A World Without Email."
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.380]   So if you wanna deep dive on some of those issues,
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.760]   I'm pulling from a lot of those thoughts.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.980]   (upbeat music)
