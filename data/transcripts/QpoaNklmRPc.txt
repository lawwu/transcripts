[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360]   Let's talk about oral health.
[00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.040]   Most all, not all, but most all mouthwashes,
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.880]   especially those containing alcohol
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.680]   are terrible for oral health.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.660]   No specific food, not even sugar causes cavities.
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.700]   Cavities are caused by bacteria that feed on sugar.
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.080]   The real big question with toothpaste is always,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.840]   should I use a toothpaste that has fluoride
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.880]   or avoid toothpaste that have fluoride?
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.160]   Some people, I remember this in college would say,
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.280]   oh, if you've got a scratch in the back of your throat,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.200]   you're getting sick, you should drink.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.520]   That's what they said, you should drink.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.760]   It's going to kill that thing off.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.760]   Well, guess what?
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.920]   It does the exact opposite.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.920]   So Xylitol is a very potent tool for improving oral health.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.800]   So I strongly suggest that all of us
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.440]   take a look at what we are currently doing
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.780]   for our tooth and oral health
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.720]   and consider what modifications are best for us.
