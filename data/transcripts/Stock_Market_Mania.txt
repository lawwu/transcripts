[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.040]   And man, every time I try to get out, they pull me back in.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.880]   And who's they in this case?
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.640]   They is the stock market and the mania
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.200]   that's going on with GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Bed,
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.880]   Bath, and Beyond, and a whole bunch of other stocks.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.100]   Several hedge funds have shorted.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.640]   And the Reddit horde have gone long
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.640]   and pumped it up to short squeeze
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.920]   and crushed these hedge funds.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.640]   Did you know that Melvin Capital lost 53% in January 2021 alone?
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280]   53%, folks.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.040]   That is ridiculous.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.040]   You and I probably outperformed being down less than 53%
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.840]   in January 2021.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.520]   So maybe we should start hedge funds ourselves.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.800]   If you want to make money, you need
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.320]   to start or join a hedge fund, preferably a reputable hedge
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.520]   fund, because it's other people's money, folks.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.360]   You just whip it around, take huge leverage bets.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.160]   And if you win big, you get 2% or maybe even 3%
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.120]   of assets under management as a fee.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.880]   And then you get 20% to sometimes 30% of the profits.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.560]   So let's say you make a billion dollars in profits.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.440]   Well, OK, that's a lot.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.400]   You're going to be able to rake in 200 to 300
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.240]   million of those profits.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.000]   And then if the fund goes bust or goes down 50%
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.600]   the following year, well, what you do
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.560]   is you strategically start a new fund within the fund,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.760]   because you cannot make that carry unless you get back
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.960]   to the high water mark.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.680]   So you start a new fund.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.440]   You market it and say, this is a one-off black swan event.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.860]   You start a new fund, and you just
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.000]   talk about your previous track record.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.680]   And then you make more money, because if your fund is down,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.720]   the beauty of this business model
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.120]   is that you don't have to give any of the money back.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.320]   You just stop making more money.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.600]   How sweet is that?
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.240]   So from 1999 to 2001, I used to work on the 49th floor
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.840]   at One New York Plaza in New York City.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.120]   The 49th floor was the international equity sales
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   and trading floor at Goldman Sachs,
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.240]   and the atmosphere was electric just like it is today.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.920]   However, the mania in the stock market today
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.640]   feels at least two times greener than it ever
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.320]   did in 1999 and 2000 during the time of the first dot com
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.960]   bubble burst.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.320]   Therefore, I implore investors to be careful, especially
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.040]   speculative investors in all these type of names.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.280]   I remember buying $3,000 worth of a company called VCSY.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.560]   It was a Chinese microcap internet stock in early 2000.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.160]   I told my friends on the Latin America desk,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.680]   who then bought the name--
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.000]   you know, it's just a small cap.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   They buy several thousand shares.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.300]   Then they told their friends on the US equities desk
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.000]   upstairs on the 50th floor, and they bought.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.120]   And then within a week, everybody I knew in my analyst
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.200]   class had bought VCSY.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.640]   Then they told their roommates and friends
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.720]   who worked at Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.840]   Brothers as well.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.560]   As a result, VCSY promptly went up 55x within a few short
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.240]   months, and then went right back down by the start of 2001.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.740]   So what I realize is every year there is some type of VCSY.
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.600]   It gains a lot of interest, a lot of momentum,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.760]   and then explodes, and then it goes right back to where
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.400]   it was before all the mania.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.320]   I'm pretty confident within three to six months,
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.680]   most of these names like GameStop and AMC Entertainment
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.000]   will drop back down to their pre-mania levels.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.720]   Think about this in terms of earnings.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.940]   All this price action has nothing
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.400]   to do with short-term earnings.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.600]   And these companies have to report quarterly earnings.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.840]   So if the stock goes up 10x in a quarter,
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.880]   the earnings are obviously not going up 10x.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.640]   Therefore, once these companies report earnings,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.960]   fundamentals should slowly take over at least.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.440]   And if not, these bubble stocks have a lifecycle of their own.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.760]   And once people start selling, it's down 3%, 5%, 10%,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.680]   then the stampede gets out quick.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.080]   Therefore, if you've been able to benefit from the insanity,
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.480]   I highly recommend you take some profits.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.040]   You can never lose if you lock in a gain.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.360]   Remember this mantra when you're investing,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.680]   especially when you're day trading or speculating.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.380]   You can never lose if you lock in a gain.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.680]   Once you take profits, I suggest converting
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.960]   some of that funny money into real assets,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.360]   hard assets like real estate that
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.560]   will continue to hold value long after these stock
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.000]   bubbles have burst.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.160]   From 1999 to now, I've consistently
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.520]   used the funny money I've made to buy real estate.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.640]   Real estate not only provides utility,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.160]   it also generates income, which is much more valuable today
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.800]   because interest rates have declined so much.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.280]   It simply takes a lot more capital
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.600]   to generate the same amount of risk-adjusted income.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.320]   The 10-year bond yield, it went from 0.51% to now around 1%.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.080]   It's not moving up.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.720]   I've got a call that it's going to average about 1.25% in 2021.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.840]   And even then, I think that might be aggressive.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.120]   I don't think the 10-year bond yield or interest rates
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.840]   are going to go up much at all in 2021 and maybe even in 2022.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.600]   Therefore, if you've got tremendous capital gains,
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.280]   convert some of those gains into income-producing assets.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.180]   Sure, you can convert it into a Lamborghini if you want,
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.840]   or a handbag, or some shoes, or whatever.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.440]   But I just like to buy real assets because over time,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.560]   over time, I think they're going to do you good.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.320]   And you know what?
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.560]   Despite the insanity in some stocks today,
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.480]   I still think it's worth trying to take a punt with a minor
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.360]   portion of your portfolio.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.800]   Talking 1% to 5% of your portfolio, take a punt.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   See what happens.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.240]   Looking back, all of my big wins and big losses
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.080]   have come from investing in individual stock names.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.520]   And in terms of what percentage of your investment
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.920]   portfolio should be in active versus passive, well, I think
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.920]   all of us can agree that investing passively
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.040]   in index funds and ETFs is the way to go long term
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   because active fund managers have a very difficult time
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.960]   of outperforming their respective indices.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.080]   And if you look at the retail investor track
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.560]   record from 1998 to 2018, I think
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.720]   we're generating like 1.9% on average returns a year,
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.760]   which sucks.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.480]   That's like the bottom of the barrel.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.960]   So you can't really trust ourselves
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.920]   to do good over the long term.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.460]   Sure, over the short term, we can just
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.440]   crush it, get lucky, whatever.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.240]   But over the longer term, three to five to 10 year track
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.480]   records, it's really difficult to outperform.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.200]   So I recommend investing 80% to 90%
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.760]   of your investable assets in passive index funds or ETFs.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.120]   And then go actively invest 10% to 20% of your portfolio
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.960]   in single stock names.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.680]   Are you really going to blow yourself up
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.440]   if you invest in Apple Computer with $100 billion
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.200]   plus cash hoard and just cash flow out
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.040]   the wazoo every single quarter?
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.840]   Probably not.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.280]   Could you lose a lot of money investing in GameStop
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.120]   at $400 a share when it's over $22 billion in market cap
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.800]   from just a couple hundred million dollars a month ago?
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.200]   I would say the chances are high.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.440]   So you've got to figure out what type of single stock
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.600]   investments you're trying to invest in,
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.160]   knowing that every single company
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.200]   has a different level of risk.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.760]   The same thing goes for buying real estate.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.720]   If you think about it, buying a property
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.520]   is like going all in on a single stock,
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.320]   and usually with leverage, because you're
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.920]   going to take out a mortgage most of the time.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.720]   If you hit it right over, let's say, a 10 year period,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.800]   you could become very wealthy with this single investment.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.480]   Today, I've decided to go all in on big city real estate again.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.160]   I live in San Francisco, so I'm going
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.760]   to be buying San Francisco real estate,
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.160]   and I'm also looking at Manhattan real estate.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.040]   I'm pretty certain the herd will flock back to big cities
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.680]   once there is herd immunity.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.920]   I remember clearly San Francisco feeling like a ghost town
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.200]   when I arrived in 2001.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.120]   Then things started taking off in 2003,
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.160]   and it continued to take off until about 2008.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.200]   And then I remember things getting really dire
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.320]   in 2008 and 2010.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.480]   Traffic was down, restaurants were closing down.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.120]   I could always get a reservation anywhere I wanted to go.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.200]   Then things started looking up a little bit in 2011.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.480]   And then by the end of 2011 and 2012,
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.440]   things started picking up again.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.000]   Therefore, I think the same thing
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.600]   is going to happen with 2020 and early 2021
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.520]   being relatively slow.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.440]   But then that fear of missing out, that FOMO,
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.440]   that desire to get back in and be where the action is,
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.400]   and the job opportunities, and the networking
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.880]   is going to come back.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.040]   So there's really only a one to two year window of opportunity
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.880]   before prices start running away from us again.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.120]   The thing with real estate is that for most all of us,
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.960]   the piece of real estate we want to buy
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.240]   is way more expensive than our annual income.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.520]   So let's say a property costs $500,000
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.880]   and your income is $100,000.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.040]   If the property increases by 10%, that's $50,000.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.480]   If your income increases by 10%, that's only $10,000.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.080]   So you're always going to lag behind real estate
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.520]   when you compare the property you want to buy
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.240]   and your income.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.640]   For most people.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.960]   Therefore, when there are windows of opportunity
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.040]   and you want to go long real estate,
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.440]   you need to take advantage.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.200]   Because frankly, once that window closes,
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   real estate is going to go up in a sense
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   that it's going to pass you by.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.820]   You're not going to be able to catch up
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.560]   unless you have a really glorious career
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.200]   and you just crush it out of the park
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.360]   and your income goes up much faster
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.000]   and it grows much larger.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   So what about thoughts on the overall stock market
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.080]   and whether we're in a bubble or not?
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.880]   Well, valuations are certainly expensive.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.920]   We need to see at least 25% to 30% earnings growth in 2021
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.480]   to see valuations at around 25 times, 24, 25 times earnings.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.680]   And that's already on the top 15% high end
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.560]   of historical averages.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.400]   Melvin Capital, the hedge fund that
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.520]   was short GameStop and other names,
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.320]   supposedly lost 53% in January, right?
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.160]   That's according to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.480]   Not only is 53% a massive percentage loss,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.960]   but it's also a massive absolute dollar amount loss,
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.920]   given Melvin Capital had over $10 billion in assets
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.280]   under management.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.840]   So Melvin Capital would have to rebound by 113%
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.040]   just to get back to even.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.960]   If Melvin Capital doesn't get back to even,
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.520]   its fund managers and analysts don't
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.080]   get paid a portion of the profits
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.680]   that I was talking about.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.560]   In such a scenario, it's easy to see Melvin Capital shut down
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.960]   because it could take years, maybe never,
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.320]   for Melvin Capital to get back to even.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.520]   So the worry on the street is that Melvin Capital
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.680]   and a bunch of other similar hedge funds
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.840]   will have to liquidate positions, long positions,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.360]   in a fire sale and close up shop.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.320]   As a result, there will be continued selling pressure
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.240]   in the broader markets until enough of these hedge funds
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.200]   close down or wind down their positions.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.640]   And actually, this happened in the past.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.920]   In 1998, when long-term capital management
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.200]   run by John Merriweather, who was an ex-Solomon Brothers
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.160]   bond trader, blew up because it had too much leverage
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.520]   in wrong-way bets.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.600]   The markets definitely took a hit in 1998.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.920]   A lot of uncertainty, a lot of front-running
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.200]   on these positions.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.480]   And what we learned was there were a lot of one-way bets.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.400]   A lot of these funds who market themselves
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.960]   as having a secret black box, algorithmic trading,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.040]   scientific equity, all that stuff,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.880]   they were all shorting and longing
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.640]   very similar securities.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.480]   So when one had to unwind, it's just a domino effect.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.800]   And right now, there's even more leverage and more capital
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.560]   chasing similar types of positions.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.440]   So the volatility is going to increase right now,
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.680]   which is why you need to be very, very aware
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.880]   and be very, very careful.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.280]   If you want to read a great book about hedge funds
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.160]   collapsing and roiling the markets,
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.240]   check out When Genius Failed by Roger Lowenstein.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.840]   This is about the long-term capital management situation.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.920]   And I think it's going to happen in 2021 and probably
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.880]   many, many years to come.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.920]   We all knew going into this year that equity valuations are
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.600]   rich.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.120]   Therefore, a sell-off, although disappointing--
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.200]   I mean, it really is disappointing that we basically
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.280]   round-tripped January's gains--
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.440]   should not come as a surprise.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.040]   I've also shared with you my 2021 stock market prediction
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.840]   and real estate market prediction, which
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.000]   is decidedly tamer than my old shop's prediction of 4,300
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.280]   on the S&P 500 by year end.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.680]   I've had a month to think about my 2021 prediction of 4,088
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.320]   on the S&P 500.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.200]   And at this point, I'm sticking with it.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.560]   It's not a huge gain, but it's still a gain.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.360]   And since there is upside from current levels to my 4,088
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.520]   price target, I'm rationally going
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.360]   to be buying stock whenever there is a sell-off.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.760]   So whenever there's a 2-plus percent sell-off,
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.920]   I've been buying.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.440]   And I'll continue to buy so long as my thesis doesn't change,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.840]   because I will continue to have cash flow coming
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.280]   in every single month.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.040]   One thing I do strongly believe is
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.560]   that there is a lot of savings, a lot of liquidity
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.320]   on the sidelines ready to buy.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.880]   We saw the US personal saving rate jump to 33% in April 2020.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.400]   And it's since come down, but it just
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.600]   shows that Americans, we can save if we want to.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.200]   And we have been saving during the start of the global
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.400]   pandemic every single month.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.560]   So I believe the more the stock market goes down,
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.440]   the more it'll capture some of this liquidity
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.680]   off the sidelines.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.720]   Further, I've used this latest sell-off as an opportunity
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.120]   to fund my kids' 529 plans for the year.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.040]   You can contribute $15,000 a year, which is the gift tax
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.280]   exemption amount.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.480]   So the other day, I sent checks, $10,000 for my son,
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.240]   $10,000 for my daughter.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.560]   Thank you very much, market sell-off.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.760]   And if you have a Roth IRA, traditional IRA, solo 401(k),
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.520]   SEP IRA, or 401(k), I'd use this opportunity
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.680]   to contribute to these funds as well.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.480]   These investment accounts are for the long term.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.760]   Therefore, short-term sell-offs provide opportunity.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.720]   For example, I won't be tapping my kids' 521 plans
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.960]   for at least another 14 years.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.800]   I think we can safely predict that there's
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.680]   going to be 5% to 10% corrections in 2021,
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.480]   at least one or two times.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.440]   Therefore, to take advantage of these corrections,
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.920]   you have to monitor your liquidity.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.920]   You have to have capital in order to invest.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.440]   Therefore, please take some time to analyze your net worth,
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.600]   your current asset allocation of various asset classes,
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.920]   your stock and bond allocation, and get
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.960]   an idea of how much cash you have to tap
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.360]   and how much cash flow is coming in over the next several
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.120]   months.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.800]   As for me, I have mentioned that most of my funds this year
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.960]   will go to a venture debt fund, a private equity fund,
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.280]   and to real estate.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.400]   However, I'm still going to be maxing out my solo 401(k),
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.800]   SEP IRA, and also my kids' 529 plans.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.000]   I'm still bullish on the stock market.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.920]   I'm very bullish on the real estate market.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.880]   And I'll definitely let you know either through this podcast
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.360]   or through a newsletter or through a post
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.040]   if I change my mind.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.880]   Because I'm definitely invested in the economy, the stock
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.560]   market, the real estate market, and the bond market.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.840]   So I don't want us to give back a lot of our gains
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.720]   that we had from 2020.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.360]   I want us to continue to try to win at the investing game.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.240]   So if you feel that I'm missing something,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.040]   that I have some blind spot that I should talk about,
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.520]   let me know in the comments section of any single post.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   It's definitely worth talking about everything.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.800]   It's important that we have humility as investors
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.000]   to not confuse brains with the bull market
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.600]   and to have the proper risk exposure.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.800]   Thanks so much, everyone.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.240]   I hope you enjoyed this podcast.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.200]   And if you really did, I'd love a positive review
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.600]   wherever you listen to this podcast.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.360]   Thanks, folks.
