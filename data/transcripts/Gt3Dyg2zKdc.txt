[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.800]   His law firm is the Watkins Law Firm.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.000]   Prior to starting his firm, he has served as a compliance officer with several national
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.420]   brokerage firms and as the director of financial planning for the advisor industry of an international
[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.920]   insurance corporation.

[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.760]   I'm looking forward to my conversation with Jim today because of his deep knowledge about
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.520]   fiduciary law, but not just for people in the investment industry.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.120]   Fiduciary duty for perhaps you who may be a trustee over a family trust or the beneficiary
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   of a trust.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.440]   I'll also be talking about nonprofit organization fiduciaries and pension fund fiduciaries and
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.680]   of course investment advisor fiduciaries.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.200]   So with no further ado, let me introduce James W. Watkins III.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   Welcome to the podcast, Jim.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.080]   Thank you for inviting me, Rick.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.640]   I have many questions today and I know that there's a lot of misunderstanding about who
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.960]   is a fiduciary, what fiduciary means, who is not a fiduciary.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   I've always been confused by a lot of these things.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.640]   But before we get into that, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.980]   How did you get into this business?
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.720]   In 1994, for the first time, the SEC required broker-dealers to regulate and oversee the
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.360]   trading activity of investment advisors.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.520]   It's a relatively new area.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.600]   There weren't a lot of people who knew those laws.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.720]   I happen to be one, so I went to work for one of the largest independent broker-dealers.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.560]   And from there, I just gradually grew into the fiduciary duties, the fiduciary law, because
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.920]   I am an attorney.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.560]   I have served as a compliance director both for broker-dealers and registered investment
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.240]   advisors.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:39.000]   What I do right now is counseling services for pension plans, also provide advice to
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.840]   high-net-worth individuals, and I provide advice and counseling to trusts, trustees,
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   and beneficiaries.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.720]   I also do some work as an expert witness in 401(k) litigation cases.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.880]   And we'll get into some of those in a minute, because there is at least one important case
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.320]   in front of the Supreme Court right now, which could change the way 401(k) trustees select
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.800]   investment options, correct?
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   Correct.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:16.920]   What I wanted to do today was to look at all of the different ways a person can fall under
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.560]   a fiduciary duty.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.880]   And it's not just investment advisors or trustees of pension funds.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:33.520]   A lot of families have set up accounts where there are irrevocable trusts and the trustees
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.280]   who are overseeing those accounts, usually the parents or the grandparents, have a fiduciary
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.680]   duty to those assets because they're not managing their own assets anymore.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.520]   Those assets are actually in an irrevocable trust.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.560]   So to start out today, let's start out with something as simple as that.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.960]   Can you talk about family trusts, individual irrevocable trusts, and things that we are
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.600]   all maybe subject to at some point in our lives with our own family?
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.000]   Well, there are two main ways that someone becomes a fiduciary.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.280]   One is by law, because a statute or regulation imposes the duty on that person.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.800]   The second way is by contract.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.880]   But when you talk about a trust, especially with a family, the assumption of a fiduciary
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.320]   duty is by law, because if you're serving as a trustee, whether it be of a nonprofit
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.000]   or just a family, like you said, irrevocable trust, it's less formal.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.200]   So whoever the family agrees will serve as the fiduciary serves as the fiduciary.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.880]   The duties of a fiduciary come from the third restatement of trust, and the two main duties
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.900]   of a fiduciary are the duty of prudence, and then there's a duty of loyalty.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:13.920]   The duty of prudence requires that anyone serving in a fiduciary capacity has to manage
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:20.760]   the assets that they're managing with the care, skill, and prudence of what they call
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.360]   the prudent man standard.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:31.760]   The duty of loyalty requires that the fiduciary manage the assets with an eye solely to the
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.600]   benefit of the beneficiaries.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:42.560]   So the fiduciary can't put their interest ahead of the beneficiaries of the trust itself.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.440]   That said, even in a family situation, even though it's less formal, that person, that
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.160]   trustee of that trust still has the same duties.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.360]   It doesn't matter how you become a fiduciary, the duties are going to be the same.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.720]   Okay, so let me just circle back a little bit to irrevocable trust because it does affect
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   a lot of people.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.880]   Can you give us some examples of where a fiduciary who's managing an irrevocable trust might
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.320]   put their own circumstances ahead of the beneficiaries?
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:24.140]   The prime example of that would be a situation where if the individual, the person that serves
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:32.540]   as a fiduciary, is a professional investment advisor, and by that, that means not only
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.800]   a registered investment advisor, it could be a stockbroker.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.640]   And in that situation, if that person does work in the investment industry, it's possible
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:51.280]   that they could recommend products that are going to benefit them financially more than
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.680]   they may benefit the trust itself and the beneficiaries.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:04.560]   Well, how does that reconcile with trust companies who are the trustees over these irrevocable
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:13.040]   family trusts, and yet they invest in their own mutual funds or they hire themselves to
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:20.280]   manage the investment portfolio and never really monitor the performance?
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.680]   How does that all reconcile?
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:29.000]   You as the beneficiary of the irrevocable trust still have a duty to monitor whoever
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.920]   is managing the trust.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.520]   From the trust company standpoint, they still have a responsibility.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:44.840]   Remember, I said that if you're a fiduciary, you have the same responsibilities, whether
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:51.380]   you're a professional trust company, whether you're a family member, that is the name fiduciary.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.020]   So the responsibilities are the same.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.280]   So the trust company, you mentioned proprietary funds.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:10.640]   If a trust company does offer or a bank commercial trust division, if the company offers proprietary
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:18.440]   investments, it still has a duty as a fiduciary to make sure that the use of those funds,
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.160]   the selection of those funds is prudent.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:29.080]   Again, the duty and loyalty of a fiduciary requires that they put the interests of the
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.540]   beneficiaries of the trust first, first and foremost.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:43.520]   There may be a residual benefit to them, but the primary benefit has to be to the beneficiaries.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.040]   So I've met with several people over my years who were the beneficiaries of these trusts,
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.360]   and the grantor had passed.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:10:03.480]   And a professional trustee was named who also was working at a institution that had proprietary
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:11.520]   products and also fairly costly, active money management strategies.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:20.520]   And it never did I ever see the trustee say, "Our company is not doing a good job managing
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.720]   this money," even though the fees were considerably higher than what you could get someplace else.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:37.840]   And it was beholden upon the beneficiaries to petition in some way to have this trustee
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.140]   fired and taken the money away.
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.480]   Explain all that to me, because it really is difficult for me to get my head around
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.080]   how all this works.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.880]   Well, as an attorney, I do that a lot.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:03.200]   I'm quite often called in to analyze the portfolio that's been produced for the beneficiaries.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.880]   And I believe the simplest way to evaluate the prudence of investments, both the portfolio
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:16.560]   as a whole or individual, is by simply doing a cost-benefit analysis.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:23.080]   I compare the incremental costs of the investments, each individual investment, to the incremental
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.880]   return.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:31.760]   I use basically two tests, and these are the two tests that I tell fiduciaries, especially
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.760]   family members.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:39.680]   They quite often, they'll ask me, "How do I decide what to put in this trust?"
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.240]   And I tell them, "Compare two investments, typically an actively managed investment to
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.720]   an index fund."
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.160]   They're two basic questions.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:55.880]   The first question is, "Is the actively managed fund outperforming the index fund?"
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.360]   If it is, fine, we'll move to the second question.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.320]   If it isn't, then you're losing money.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.560]   So that actively managed investment, you should get rid of it.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:15.680]   If the investment is producing a positive incremental return, then the question is,
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:22.240]   "Do the incremental costs exceed that incremental return?"
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.520]   And if the incremental costs are greater, you're basically losing money.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:35.520]   So at that point, based upon what I find, I'll tell a family, "We need to remove this
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.600]   trustee."
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.400]   The process itself is very simple.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.120]   The court, you go to the courts.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.960]   In some states, it's the probate court.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.400]   In other states, it may be the superior court.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.240]   But basically, you just have, you file a petition.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.840]   You have the beneficiaries of the trust say, "We want to remove this person."
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:04.840]   And even if, let's say that the trust was created under a will, it's very hard typically
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:10.160]   to change, well, the courts don't want to change someone's last request.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:16.240]   But in a situation of a trust, the courts recognize that it's more important to carry
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.880]   out the decedent's last wishes.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.880]   So it's basically very easy.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.000]   You go to the court.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.920]   If all the beneficiaries agree, they want this person removed for whatever reason.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.840]   Doesn't matter if they just don't like him.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.960]   It doesn't matter if they say, "Well, the investments aren't doing well."
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.440]   If all the beneficiaries agree, the court will remove that trustee.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:50.560]   But at the same time, you have to inform the court who the successor trustee will be.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.520]   Because they're not just going to leave a trust with nobody managing it.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:02.720]   So if they're going to remove this one individual, be it a professional fiduciary or family member,
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.520]   they want to know going into that who's going to be taken over.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.760]   What does the trust company at this point say?
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.480]   I mean, you know, they're going to be taken off this trust potentially.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.360]   Are they there in the courtroom as well?
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.680]   They're in the courtroom as well, and that's a great question.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:25.040]   One of the things that has always concerned me is that quite typically, corporate trustees
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.720]   want you to sign a document.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:34.040]   So let's say that family comes to me and says, "We want to get rid of this trustee."
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.560]   And let's say it's a professional trustee.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.520]   They can fight it if they want to.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.120]   But just like I said, in most cases, the court says, "No.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.040]   If all the beneficiaries want you gone, you're gone."
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.720]   Like I said, they know that going into court, the court's going to grant their request.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.380]   And it's overreaching.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:15:00.660]   It's improper for a fiduciary to basically ask the beneficiaries to grant them immunity
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.600]   for anything they did.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.400]   But they will try it unless you have an attorney that tells them, "We're not doing that.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.400]   That's improper.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   That's unethical."
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.760]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.520]   How often do you see this?
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.980]   How many cases do you get involved with where a professional trustee, I'm talking big
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:23.720]   banks, big trust companies, are fired because of imprudent investing?
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.960]   You see it more than you'd think.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:32.400]   When my father passed away, he left a sizable trust, left a commercial trustee, because
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.960]   one thing is a lot of estate planning attorneys and attorneys that just handle these kind
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:45.240]   of things, they usually have associations or relationships with banks, trust companies.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.560]   So it's a you wash my back, I'll wash yours.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:54.240]   In my case with my father, all the kids got together and I got a power of attorney from
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.060]   my mother and they didn't fight it.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:07.720]   Unless you can show a really, really strong reason, the courts don't want to force beneficiaries
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.940]   to work with people they don't trust.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:17.040]   Because the most important element of any fiduciary relationship is trust.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.120]   What happens if you have three children and two of them want to leave the trustee and
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.800]   one of them does not?
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.600]   How complicated does that become?
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.960]   Another great question.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.280]   That doesn't happen all that often, because usually the reason they want to get rid of
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.400]   a professional trustee is poor performance.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:41.900]   In the situation where it does exist, if I'm involved, I meet with all the beneficiaries
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.820]   together and we try to clear the air.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:50.660]   I want to find out why the one family member that does not want to remove the trustee,
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.220]   why is it?
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:59.420]   But usually in those situations, and the more beneficiaries there are, sometimes it's the
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.740]   harder to get everybody to agree.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:08.880]   If everybody doesn't agree, then you still go to court and you just be honest with the
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.120]   judge and you say, "Your Honor, you can see from the petition, all but one or two of the
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.920]   family members want the trustee removed."
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:25.120]   Typically, these kind of hearings about removal of a trustee are usually in probate court.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.020]   Probate court is less formal than other courts.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:34.300]   In most cases, the judge will just ask the beneficiaries that do not want to remove the
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.860]   trustee, why they don't want to remove the trustee, and he has an informal discussion
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.280]   with them there.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:47.860]   At the end of the day, he typically removes the trustee anyway, since the majority of
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.280]   the beneficiaries, that's their wish.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   Great information, Jim.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.420]   I just had no idea how it all worked, and I have had so many situations with clients
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:02.580]   who got into this problem where their money was not being well managed by a professional
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.300]   trustee and they did not know what to do about it, so thank you for that.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.180]   Let's go on to the next thing, which is non-profit organizations.
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.420]   Here, a lot of us are asked to sit on non-profit organizations and we're asked to be on the
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.980]   finance committee and maybe on the investment committee, where we're going to oversee the
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.460]   foundation or the endowment.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:31.700]   What duties do we have there and what laws oversee endowments and foundation fiduciary
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.700]   duty?
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.900]   Basically, the same thing.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:39.700]   You've got your two primary duties, the duty of prudence, the duty of loyalty.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:44.260]   It doesn't matter what the investment is.
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:52.540]   When you get into a situation involving a non-profit, I strongly recommend that you
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:19:00.380]   hire outside counsel, and by counsel, I don't mean attorney, but I mean someone who is more
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.520]   experienced and knowledgeable in the investment industry.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:12.380]   When you do that, you have to be very objective in analyzing the analyst.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:19.060]   Again, I think one of the important points that I always make to people on non-profits,
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:25.380]   you can bring in third parties to help you analyze investments and to make recommendations,
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:31.060]   but the ultimate responsibility and liability is yours.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.260]   It's important to go back to the two-step process I talked about before.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:45.700]   Whatever recommendations a third party makes, the board itself has got to make the ultimate
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:53.100]   decision and has to be able to analyze investments to determine if they are or are not prudent.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:20:01.620]   One of the important things about the restatement of trust, a lot of times, professional investors,
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:08.760]   professional counselors, will look at the portfolio as a whole, but fiduciaries are
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:16.540]   analyzed not only with regard to the portfolio as a whole, but each individual investment,
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:24.260]   so it's important for anyone serving on a board to learn some basic fundamentals.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:30.700]   Simplest one is what I talked about before, cost efficiency or inefficiency.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:38.140]   Something that's important is a lot of professional counsel or advisors will recommend actively
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.740]   managed funds.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:46.660]   Unfortunately, the research shows that most actively managed funds do not outperform index
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.460]   funds and are therefore cost inefficient.
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:57.220]   Cost inefficiency is a violation of your fiduciary duty and will result in liability.
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.460]   So let me give you a case.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.020]   This happened to me more than once.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:13.680]   I am asked to go to a non-profit organization, say a private school, and give a presentation
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:21.040]   about low-cost index investing because someone on the board wants to educate the other people
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.140]   on the board.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:30.780]   So they're interviewing advisors to take over the management of their endowment, say a million
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.260]   dollar endowment.
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.500]   Back when I was managing money, and I don't do that anymore, but back when I was, I was
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.940]   asked to come in to be the passive indexing alternative.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:49.100]   And I learned after doing this a few times and not getting the account, I learned to
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:56.740]   ask who else is on the board besides the person who wanted me to come in, and what affiliations
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:05.020]   do they have with the local community, and also what company or what advisor or what
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.480]   bank is currently managing the money.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.560]   Because nine times out of ten, if it's somebody local and they have some sort of a connection
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:23.940]   to that board, it's really difficult to move them off of that local advisor or local bank.
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.140]   And I'll give you one example.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:35.720]   This one school had a local bank managing their portfolio, charging them 1% fee or some
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.020]   ridiculous thing, and they were not doing well.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.660]   It was all active management.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.460]   It was clear they were not doing well.
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:51.900]   But they didn't want to leave this bank because the bank every year held a fundraiser for
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:58.460]   the school, and they raised like $10,000 in a golf tournament, and they gave that money
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.500]   to the school.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:08.540]   And they were afraid that if they fired the bank, that they'd lose that fundraiser, and
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.860]   the money that they took in from the fundraiser was greater than the money that they were
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.980]   losing by not being in index funds.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.980]   Wow.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:17.980]   How do you read into that one?
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.980]   That's an interesting one.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:25.140]   I thought I had an answer until you threw in that last part about the benefit.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.260]   I mean, I couldn't fault them.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.760]   It's like, okay, I understand why you continue to use this bank, because they're raising
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.660]   money for you and they're giving money to the school, so net-net, you're coming out
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.740]   ahead even though the bank does a lousy job managing the money.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.580]   You know, I'm going to disagree with you there.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:49.460]   It isn't a net-net, because remember what I said that the fiduciary has a responsibility
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.580]   to act solely on the benefit.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:24:00.020]   So the members of the board of the school have a responsibility to act solely for the
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:10.020]   benefit of the school, and even if the proceeds from the charity event exceed the loss, if
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.300]   I were the attorney in that case, if one of the members came to me and said, "What do
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.300]   we do?"
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:22.860]   My argument would be, I don't have to incur that loss, whether it be you or anyone else.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:28.500]   As the member of the board, that fiduciary has a responsibility to look solely at the
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.780]   results produced by the bank serving as the fiduciary.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:41.600]   I know what you said about the fact that the benefit produced more money, but if I'm the
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:47.020]   attorney for the school, I'm going to argue that's an unnecessary loss.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:53.140]   I can find some, and my argument, my personal argument would be, I can find somebody else.
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:25:00.180]   I'm pretty sure Rick can find somebody to help produce that benefit and not lose money.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:08.380]   So from a legal perspective, bottom line for me is, you're unnecessarily losing money,
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.540]   and that's just not acceptable in a fiduciary role if it's preventable.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:19.200]   Now, sometimes, you know, things happen like 9/11, and things happen, but based upon what
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.540]   you're telling me right now, this was pretty much a situation where they were annually
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:33.500]   losing money and agreeing to lose that money in order to get the money from the golf tournament.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:39.260]   I can tell you right now, I can't imagine a court not ruling that that's a fiduciary
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.780]   breach.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.100]   Just to clarify, they weren't losing money.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.220]   They were just underperforming index funds by just about the amount they were getting
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.340]   from the golf tournament.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:53.180]   But anyway, these conflicts of interest in these, you know, small endowments and foundations
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:59.060]   where the people sitting on the board are brokers, you know, or some other insurance
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.220]   agents or something like that, because they're not investment experts.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.540]   They're salespeople.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:09.520]   I find them to be really problematic, and, you know, they have the right to sit on the
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:15.020]   board, but how well informed is everyone else on the board?
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.020]   Ultimately that's the real problem.
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.660]   I'm not going to get into details, but there was a very famous case involving New York
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:26.900]   University and their 403(b) plan, and that was exactly the situation.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.780]   They're called third party administrators.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:34.900]   They basically oversee and manage a 401(k) account, and it was a very well company.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:41.820]   When the case was going to court, testimony came out that a lot of the members of the
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:48.320]   investment committee on the NYU board had no idea about investments.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.340]   Some of them didn't even know they were on the investment committee or on the board.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.540]   That's not an unusual situation, and quite often I'll see a board like you said that
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:06.020]   either has the actual investment company, the mutual funds representative on the board,
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:12.720]   but I point out to the other fiduciaries you've got a responsibility not to let one member
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   bully you.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:20.940]   I hate to keep going back, but it's an important point that a fiduciary, each individual fiduciary
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:28.860]   has an individual responsibility to ensure that they're doing their job in ensuring that
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:36.000]   prudent investments are what are being chosen, not because of somebody's, what they do for
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.180]   a living or affiliation with a bank or anything like that.
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:47.060]   So each individual fiduciary has to understand, and it takes someone like you or me to remind
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.500]   them you're going to be held responsible.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.180]   So you can't sit over here and say, "Well, I just deferred to him."
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.020]   You can't do that.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:03.700]   Let's move on to the next subject, which is the advisors, and these are the registered
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.740]   investment advisors and the brokers.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.140]   How do you split up this world?
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:19.060]   There are those who have fiduciary duty, those who don't have fiduciary duty, those who accept
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:23.620]   some fiduciary duty for some of the things they do, but don't accept fiduciary duty for
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.300]   other things that they do.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.740]   Could you explain all of this?
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:34.340]   Defining fiduciary duties vis-a-vis investment advisors is the easy part.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.180]   The law is very settled.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:42.500]   They have the same responsibilities we've been discussing, prudence and loyalty.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.160]   It's that cut and dried.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.620]   On the broker side, we're right in the middle of a change in the law.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.740]   Historically, there have been two standards.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:29:00.980]   If you're an investment advisor, you have a duty of absolute fiduciary duty.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:06.940]   Brokers on the other hand, were held to a standard of suitability.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:16.740]   People often ask me, "What's the difference between suitable advice and prudent advice?"
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:25.780]   I think the best definition I heard was suitable advice is okay, kind of okay.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.940]   Whereas fiduciary advice has to be the best advice.
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.380]   It has to be in your best interest.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:41.660]   Broker dealers, I mean brokers under the suitability standard could put their interest ahead of
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.660]   their customers.
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.060]   We're in the middle of a change right now.
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:51.180]   Back in 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted a new rule because of all
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:55.580]   the criticism of the suitability standard.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:03.480]   Right now, brokers are under what's called reg best interest.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.780]   We don't have time to go into all the nuances, but I'll tell you that basically what we've
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:18.380]   got now under reg best interest, they don't have the high level of responsibility that
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.940]   fiduciaries have.
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:28.440]   But the problem is that when the SEC enacted reg BI, they didn't define best interest.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.180]   So that's where we stand right now.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:38.380]   Are we using a common sense concept of best interest or is the SEC and they've recently
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:43.860]   said they're going to do this, they're going to define what best interest is.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:51.180]   So right now, brokers have a responsibility that's somewhere between the low level of
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:56.420]   suitability versus the high level of fiduciary prudence.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:02.860]   But arguably, they have a higher standard now because the main element in reg best interest
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:08.940]   that they didn't have under the suitability standard is now they have to consider costs.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:14.100]   Okay, so you have somebody, they're both a broker dealer and they're also a registered
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.340]   investment advisor.
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:21.060]   Part of the portfolio that they're managing is under an RIA agreement.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:25.280]   And part of the investments that are being managed are under the brokerage agreement.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:33.900]   So they might say in a court case or an arbitration against them that, well, that particular account
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.420]   is not a fiduciary relationship.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.420]   Only this account is a fiduciary relationship.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:48.740]   One of my previous jobs was to serve as a compliance director for a very large independent
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.580]   broker dealer.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.960]   Bottom line is brokers argue that they don't have a fiduciary duty, but that's been the
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.660]   typical argument.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.800]   We don't have a fiduciary duty.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.360]   Investment advisors do.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.400]   So they try to draw this mythical two hats argument.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:14.600]   Brokers are allowed by most broker dealers to either form their own independent RIA or
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.140]   a lot of brokers don't want that hassle.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.380]   They don't want management.
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:22.640]   They just want to get money from providing those services.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:28.960]   So most broker dealers in this country now have a proprietary registered investment advisor
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:36.120]   that the broker can join and offer the same advisory services that other investment advisors
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.200]   provide.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:46.000]   So they can get there and do it easily by working under the broker dealers RIA.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.800]   The term in the industry is duly registered.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:55.280]   So if you are registered with both a broker dealer and an investment advisor, to answer
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:00.960]   your question, there was a 1949 case, so what I'm about to tell you isn't new.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   It's been around for over 50 years, actually 60, 70, anyway, what the court said is that
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:16.760]   if you're a stock broker and you also provide investment advisory services, you confuse
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.640]   your client.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.600]   And the court said, we're not going to let you confuse the client.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.640]   If you're in a situation where you provide services, both as a stock broker and an investment
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.680]   advisor, you're held to the higher standard, that being the fiduciary standard.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.640]   Oh, interesting.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:41.640]   The last area that I want to touch upon are pension funds, and this would include qualified
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.640]   plans.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.440]   They fall under ERISA.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.560]   Could you explain how they're special?
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:58.160]   ERISA is the law that governs, as you said, pension plans, 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans,
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:05.180]   and it imposes a very heavy responsibility on the fiduciary of those plans.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:12.960]   Again, it's the same duties we talked about beforehand, prudence and loyalty.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:21.900]   But I'm a golfer, and as I like to tell 401(k) boards, there are no mulligans under ERISA.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:30.000]   You either do right or you do wrong, and one of the famous quotes that came out of a 401(k)
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.200]   case, and judges like to throw this out, "If you as a fiduciary make a mistake and it costs
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.560]   the plan, you're responsible."
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.720]   And typically, the fiduciaries for the plan will say, "Well, we didn't mean any harm."
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:52.580]   And this is the quote that the courts like to use, "A pure heart and an empty head are
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.620]   no defense."
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:35:00.160]   I want to get into recent court cases, because I understand the Supreme Court is in the middle
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.780]   of deciding something relatively important for the trustees of 401(k) plans.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.520]   Could you get into what the Supreme Court is working on?
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:16.900]   The case before the Supreme Court, 401(k) beneficiaries, the plan participants, filed
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:23.860]   a lawsuit against Northwestern University, and they made the allegations that the investments
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:27.580]   were imprudent, they lost money.
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:32.820]   The case was thrown out in the lower court, and the case went all the way to the Supreme
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.820]   Court, and the Supreme Court decided to hear it.
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.860]   There were two main issues before the court.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:46.020]   The lower court had thrown out the case because they had said that the attorneys for the plan
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:53.700]   participants didn't make the necessary disclosures or allegations.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:36:00.500]   The second issue, and to me, the bigger issue, was the judge in the lower court had dismissed
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:09.700]   the case because he said that the plan had included both proper and improper mutual fund
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.700]   investments.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.380]   And so, Lee called the menu of options defense.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:20.380]   He said, "As long as you offer some that are good and some that are bad, it's okay.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.100]   One bad apple doesn't spoil the whole thing."
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.080]   Well, the judge was wrong.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:34.020]   And so, the court took on the issue of whether or not a plan can offer both bad and good
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:42.260]   investments, suitable, unsuitable investments, cost-inefficient investments.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:49.500]   To me, that's the bigger issue because a lot of courts, federal courts, have been dismissing
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:56.100]   cases and denying the participants who've been hurt their day in court.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:03.660]   We obviously don't know what the court's going to say in this case, but hearing Justice Kagan
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:10.740]   really got into questioning the attorney for Northwestern University and pointing out to
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:18.060]   him that this didn't make any sense, and in fact, it's contrary to ERISA, what we talked
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:23.460]   about before, the law that covers plans.
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.980]   And she really got to the nitty-gritty and asked the attorney for Northwestern.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:33.260]   She goes, "This whole idea that you can include and offer bad and good investments, you don't
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.020]   believe that, do you?"
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.500]   And the attorney admitted, "No."
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:47.340]   And yet, almost every 401(k) plan, 403(b) plan that I look at has some index funds in
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.300]   it, which are good because you can pick them out and you can say, "Let's use just those
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.300]   index funds."
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:38:01.940]   And it has a variety of higher cost funds that look like legacy type investments.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.300]   Now, not all 401(k)s have this.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.540]   I've noticed that the newer companies, a lot of the newer tech companies, they don't have
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.980]   any of this old legacy active management stuff in there.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:19.380]   It's the older companies where these funds are hanging around in there, and they probably
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.940]   have accumulated a lot of assets over the years.
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:27.700]   And maybe there's a reluctance to take them out because a lot of beneficiaries are invested
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.700]   in those funds.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.500]   I mean, is that part of the consideration?
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.460]   I think there are two considerations here.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:42.060]   Strangely enough, ERISA talks about financial retirement readiness and buzzwords like that.
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:50.620]   But inexplicably, ERISA does not require that an employer provide investment education for
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.620]   its employees.
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:39:00.580]   So I think the reason a lot of those old time actively managed funds are in there is because
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:07.620]   the employees simply don't know how to properly evaluate a fund and don't know that the fund
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.460]   may not be in their best interest.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:20.620]   I think the second issue is from a legal perspective, I've talked to a lot of plan CEOs of corporations
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.500]   and the investment committees of their 401(k) plans.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:31.120]   And from a practical perspective, the CEOs say, well, we're not going to go in and take
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:40.260]   out the bad funds because if we do, then we're going to get sued.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:45.940]   And I have to tell them, you've got a point if you want to try to explain it away.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.780]   But I tell them, if you don't take them out, then you're going to have that specter of
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:54.260]   liability hanging over you forever.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:59.220]   So from a practical perspective, they don't want to get sued.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:05.200]   But you're not doing right by the participants, and it clearly violates the stated purpose
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:12.260]   of ERISA, and that is to help protect the financial wellness and retirement readiness
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.180]   of the plan participants.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:17.620]   Is there some sort of a safe harbor for this lawsuit?
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.020]   I think it's under 404(c).
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.020]   There is.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:29.340]   404(c) says that if you comply with these 20 requirements, then you're not, you being
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:34.680]   the plan, are not responsible for the actual performance of those investments.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.920]   So you have immunity.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:43.580]   And that's why a lot of the plans try to go for it because then, once they provide the
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:49.120]   employees with these various investment options, they're not responsible whether the performance
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.240]   is good or bad.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.260]   But Fred Rice, who's one of the leading ERISA attorneys, is on record.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.800]   He testified before the Department of Labor.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:04.240]   And Fred's been around as long as I have, 40 years, and Fred said that in all his years,
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:12.780]   they have never found a 401(k) plan that satisfied the 20 or more requirements to become eligible
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.040]   for 404(c).
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.560]   So practically speaking, yes, there is a safe harbor.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:27.600]   But once a plan tries to apply for it, they find out they're not in compliance with ERISA.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.600]   Interesting.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.440]   Are there any other noteworthy court cases that occurred in the last couple of years
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.200]   that you'd like to bring up?
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:44.160]   Yeah, I'd like to bring up the case of Brotherston versus Putnam Investments.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.280]   It was a First Circuit Federal Court of Appeals case.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.520]   And the reason it's important is that it was one of the few instances where a court, instead
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:59.800]   of trying to protect Wall Street, went out of its way to protect plan participants.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.120]   And Brotherston's noteworthy for a couple of reasons.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:09.440]   First and foremost, it ruled in favor of the plan participants.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:16.020]   The lower court judge had said, "You can't compare actively managed funds to index funds
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.440]   because index funds will always win.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.360]   They've got lower costs."
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:29.400]   And the First Circuit Court of Appeals went to the Restatement of Trusts, Section 90,
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:37.280]   which is known as the Prudent Investor Act, Prudent Investor Rule, Comment M in the Restatement
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.560]   says, "You can compare index funds and active funds."
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:47.600]   So this was one of the few times I can ever remember any court, federal court, state court
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.240]   saying index funds are fine.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:58.680]   And then to build on that, the First Circuit Court of Appeals told the broker-dealers and
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.400]   the investment advisors and mutual fund companies, "I know you're not going to be happy with
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.000]   that ruling, but you know what?
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.400]   There's an easy way to avoid this whole mess, invest in index funds."
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:15.160]   So that's a really big ruling.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:23.040]   And when you combine the court saying it isn't apples and oranges, you can compare actively
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:30.480]   managed funds and index funds, when you combine that with the ruling that we all expect the
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:37.760]   Supreme Court to make, i.e. that there is no menu of options, each individual investment
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.800]   has to be prudent.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:46.480]   That's going to pretty much help protect plan participants because it's going to hold the
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:53.200]   members of the investment committee and the plan sponsor to making decisions based solely
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.440]   on the merits of the investments.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.680]   Let me ask one question before we move on to your book, and that has to do with target
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:09.000]   date retirement funds and defaulting investors into target date retirement funds.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.760]   Number one question is, you know, good idea or not good idea?
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.360]   And number two, I've seen some pretty expensive target date retirement funds, and I've seen
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:23.120]   some pretty inexpensive target date index retirement funds.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:28.240]   Why would you have actively managed target date retirement funds when you have index
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.720]   retirement target date retirement funds?
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:37.120]   Again, I'm going to give the answer that the investment committee choosing between the
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:46.080]   target funds doesn't understand, doesn't know how to do the basic cost benefit analysis.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.640]   Plain and simple.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:53.240]   My feelings on target date funds, I'm not a big fan of them, two primary reasons.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:45:00.640]   The way most target date funds work is that as you get older and closer to approaching
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:07.480]   retirement, they gradually reduce the equity exposure.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:13.400]   In a lot of cases, you may be exposing to people that own those target date funds to
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:19.600]   more risk than A, they want or B, that they need.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.680]   The other issue that I don't think a lot of people understand about target date funds
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:32.040]   is that typically a target date fund does not provide the same level of active management
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:39.360]   that an investment advisor or an actively managed fund management does.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:46.160]   Most of these target date funds, one reason they can offer lower costs, but like you said,
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.200]   a lot of them have higher costs.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:56.560]   But one reason that they can offer lower costs is that the fund basically only rebalances
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:04.280]   or adjusts the equity or the investments in the fund once a year.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:11.760]   So take for instance, right now, we've seen a lot of increasing instability in the market.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:17.680]   And a lot of people are saying, well, I'm going to reduce my equity exposure a little
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.880]   bit.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.720]   Some people are saying get out altogether, I don't agree with that.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:33.080]   But target date funds do not allow that opportunity except maybe once a year to adjust.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:38.040]   So if you want to adjust even just a little bit, you've got to wait till the date that
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.560]   they say we're going to go back in and adjust.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:46.520]   One of the reasons I don't like target date funds is that they don't provide enough risk
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:50.280]   management opportunities for an investor.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:56.600]   And Charles Ellis, who's a well-known investment advisor, has stated that the real secret of
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:03.040]   successful investing is risk management, not the selection of investments.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:10.080]   Let's move on to your book, the 401(k), 403(b) Investment Manual, What Planned Participants
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.360]   and Planned Sponsors Really Need to Know.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.440]   The second edition just came out.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.960]   First edition was published back in 2010.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:23.480]   There's just a tremendous amount of information in here for small business owners who have
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.800]   401(k) plans and what their duties are and so forth.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:32.280]   But could you explain or talk about some of the highlights of your book?
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.280]   Sure.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:42.200]   The reason I wrote the book is, as I mentioned earlier, ERISA does not require 401(k), 403(b)
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.480]   plans to provide investor education.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:52.840]   There have been numerous studies showing that investors in general are not very knowledgeable
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.080]   about how to manage their investments.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:01.320]   In fact, I had a CEO, I gave a presentation at a conference once.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:08.640]   And after the presentation, a CEO came up to me and complimented me on the presentation.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:14.200]   And he said, "I'll never voluntarily offer investor education in my company."
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:19.840]   And I kind of gave him a look and he goes, "If I educate them, they'll realize how bad
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.920]   our plan is.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.160]   And then you and the other attorneys will come in and sue us."
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:34.280]   The reason I wrote the book was, I've tried to cover as many topics as possible, primarily
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:41.360]   about investments that are often chosen for 401(k), 403(b) plans.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:47.920]   But as we've talked about earlier, one of the big problems with these 401(k), 403(b)
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:54.960]   plans is that the investment committee members themselves don't know how to properly choose
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.960]   investments.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.240]   So, that was the reason I wrote the book.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:08.760]   I had several people ask me after giving presentation, education presentations for 401(k) plans or
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:13.080]   at conferences, they said, "Okay, loved your presentation.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.200]   Why don't you share that information with everybody?"
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.640]   So that's the purpose of the book.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.020]   It's relatively short.
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:28.160]   I'm a firm believer based on my own preferences that if a book is more than 100 pages, it's
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:32.440]   probably going to get be placed down and you're going to forget about it.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:39.480]   So it's slightly over 100 pages, and we're just trying to provide in simple, plain English,
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:48.720]   some techniques, some concerns that you should look at in deciding on the various investment
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.720]   options.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:56.560]   And even though it does say 401(k), 403(b), it's equally applicable to just your regular
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:02.640]   brokerage accounts or any kind of situation where you're going to be dealing with investments.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:07.540]   You also have a website, investsense.com, where you publish a blog every month with
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:13.320]   some great information, not just on retirement plans, but financial plans, broker, dealers,
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.840]   advisors, and you name it, the whole gamut.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:16.840]   We do.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:24.280]   And then quite often I'll speak or be called in to help a 401(k) plan like you yourself.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.640]   And they said, "We need a blog."
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:34.440]   So we have a second blog that's more oriented toward investment professionals and 401(k),
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.000]   403(b) members.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.900]   The other one is more consumer oriented.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:44.480]   The second blog is more oriented toward investment fiduciaries.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.360]   And is that also on investsense.com or is that a different website?
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.360]   No.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:51:03.080]   The second website is called the Prudent Investment Fiduciary Rules and it's at IAINSIGHTwordpress.com.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.400]   Any last words, Jim, that you want to impart on us?
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:12.200]   I mean, you've got 40 years worth of experience, you've been around, you've seen it all, you
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:17.760]   know what's right, you know what's wrong, you know where people hide behind.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.760]   Any final words?
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:25.320]   A lot of people say they're intimidated by the idea of investing.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   Don't be.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:31.280]   As I said earlier, I think the simplest way to determine the prudence of an investment
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.040]   is simply to do a cost-benefit analysis.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:40.540]   It's the same thing that we learn, cost-benefit and Econ 101.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:48.280]   Just compare the incremental costs of an investment vis-a-vis actively managed versus an index
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.700]   fund.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.600]   Compare the incremental costs to the incremental returns.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:52:00.480]   And if the incremental costs are greater than the incremental returns or the actively managed
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:06.400]   fund does not outperform the index fund, then don't invest in it.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.760]   Jim, it's been great having you on Vocal Heads on Investing.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   Thank you so much for your time today and I appreciate all the wealth of knowledge that
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   you've given us.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   Thank you, Rick.
