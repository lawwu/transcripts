[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.520]   Joshua, welcome to the show.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.860]   - Awesome to be here, dude.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.160]   I'm so excited you're doing this again.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.320]   - Oh, yeah, man.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.000]   I am too.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.860]   And I'm anxious to hear more about your story.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.300]   Obviously, we've known each other for a few years now, but it'll be good to kind of
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.500]   dig into the dirty details of your finances and take some lessons out for others to
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.040]   explore.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.080]   - You didn't tell me to have my balance sheet ready if we're getting into dirty
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.580]   details.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.380]   - Well, we can go off memory.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.920]   That's fine.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.140]   Big round numbers.
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.380]   So the first question is this, what's the one thing that you do that maybe others
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.020]   may not do that you feel has been the number one contributor to your financial
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.020]   success so far?
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.800]   - I think I'm probably willing to learn.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.100]   That's one of my strengths is I've always been a good student.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.760]   I was a good student when I was younger.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.560]   I was a good student through school.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.540]   I've always sought to be a good student.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.200]   And when it comes to finances, it's exactly the same thing.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.040]   People often, I think, get this impression that you somehow have to go out and
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.940]   recreate the wheel and find some new great idea.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.340]   You don't.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.520]   It's absurd.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.180]   The principles haven't changed.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.580]   The principles are exactly the same.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.780]   The exact application might be a little different, but the principles haven't
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.360]   changed.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.760]   One of my favorite personal finance books is George Clayton's "Richest Man in
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.660]   Babylon."
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.500]   And it's classic because he sets this financial allegory into the context of
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.240]   Babylon 3,000 years ago, 4,000 years ago, something like that.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.440]   And he demonstrates how the principles are exactly the same.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.480]   And so one of the things that I've learned is simply that you can learn the skills
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   of success and you can learn the principles of success.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.920]   In reality, they're very, very simple.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.520]   And the principles, the actions can be applied in any culture, in any context,
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.200]   in any currency, under any technology.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.560]   And once you see and understand that, you see the consistent themes throughout
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.040]   society and how to build financial success under any circumstances.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.200]   >> Yeah, so if there is a framework or a setup like that where you sort of can
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.280]   learn it once, then what kind of keeps you motivated to continue learning?
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.360]   >> Yeah, there are always interesting variations on how to apply things.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.960]   So you can always adjust and optimize.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.720]   I built this framework for radical personal finance that was my attempt to
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.440]   try to encapsulate all of the learning of finances.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.080]   And I brought it down to a 5.10 word framework.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.240]   And number four, excuse me, number five is optimize lifestyle or
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.640]   optimize everything.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.400]   So I think the reality is most of us can consistently focus on
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.200]   optimizing many aspects of finances.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.880]   We can optimize how we earn our income.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.360]   We can optimize how we spend our money, how we invest our money,
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.280]   how we do each thing.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.320]   And so there's always an optimization.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   And then the other thing that keeps me interested is that you have to
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.480]   recognize that money, when properly viewed,
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.960]   is going to transcend the specific dollars and cents and finances.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.520]   One of the biggest mistakes I think people make is they start off thinking that
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.160]   acquiring wealth or building assets or saving,
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.440]   they have the mistake that money in and of itself is a useful goal.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.960]   Money is not a valuable goal.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.720]   When I die, I'm gonna leave exactly the same amount of money behind as Bill Gates,
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.760]   all of it.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.040]   That's the reality that each of us face.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.520]   So if money is your primary goal, your goal's not really gonna work.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.480]   You're gonna find out and
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.840]   wind up in the place that so many have wound up when asked how much is enough?
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.280]   Well, just a little bit more.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.320]   So money is a very bad goal, but
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   it's a great tool to help you to accomplish other goals.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.880]   And when viewed in that context, the optimization and
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.920]   the improvement has real meaning and value.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.240]   >> I love that.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.200]   For someone who may not be as you said early on,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.760]   learning was something you always just always sort of be learning.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.560]   For someone who's maybe not naturally bent that way, is there kind of an easy
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.880]   on road to learning about personal finance that you would suggest people take?
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.120]   >> Yeah, find somebody around you who's rich and ask them how they did it.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.840]   [LAUGH] I mean, there are lots of books and things that could be accessed, but
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.880]   the process is very, very simple.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.920]   Let me give an example.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.120]   I have a family member.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.280]   This family member in my extended family,
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.080]   this family member arrived in the middle years of their life,
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.240]   the middle decades of their life.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.640]   They were from a very blue collar background, very, very humble origins.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.640]   And they had made a series of financial mistakes,
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.040]   primarily compounded by multiple divorces,
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.680]   which had completely wiped them out financially.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.440]   The man was a truck driver.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.680]   In order to build financial independence, he worked like crazy for
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.600]   about a year, two years, he and his newly married wife saved like crazy,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.600]   spent almost nothing, lived as frugally as they could, and
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.680]   used the difference in order to buy a fixer upper house to start again.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.440]   Now this is middle age, blue collar background, truck driver.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.480]   And within about, I would say, eight to ten years,
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.920]   they are now basically financially independent, have a paid for real estate,
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.120]   haven't borrowed a dollar the whole way through,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.200]   have a paid for real estate portfolio of rental houses that support them, and
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.720]   live a very comfortable, flexible lifestyle.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.800]   And they've done it in under a decade.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.640]   Not a reader, they don't read books, they don't listen to podcasts,
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.240]   they don't watch YouTube videos, they just understand the principles.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.920]   And so you can start simple.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.120]   If somebody's not a study, I'm a reader, I'm a study, I'm a listener.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.080]   That's what I do.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.840]   That is good and bad.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.720]   The good of that is that I expose myself to a lot of information,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.080]   a lot of inspiration.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.760]   The potential danger, or the potential bad, is that leads to less activity.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.120]   A good plan well executed is better than a great plan poorly executed.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.440]   And so I always have to be careful that yes, one of my strengths is I'm a learner,
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.280]   but where one of my weaknesses is I'm less of a doer than other people.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.240]   Frankly, people who get one idea and follow it through generally achieve
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.760]   more success than people like me who have 100 ideas and never capitalize on them.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.280]   >> That's interesting.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.400]   Let's go back a bit.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.840]   Was there a moment in your life where you decided to become a master of your money
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.000]   and improve your financial life?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.760]   >> Probably a couple aspects to that.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.600]   One, I'm the youngest of seven children, and
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.880]   my parents were from humble middle class background.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   My dad's an electrical engineer, so not a particularly low paying job,
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.880]   not a particularly high paying job.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.120]   But I think because my parents were generally modest, we were not poor, but
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.600]   neither were we rich.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.440]   Because of my parents particularly modest,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.560]   I think I had some insecurity that built up,
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.160]   especially given the fact that I went to a private Christian high school.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.760]   And one of these types of schools where the tuition is very expensive.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.200]   In order for my family to be able to afford to send me there,
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.280]   my mom worked at the school in order to get the tuition discount.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.440]   And all of us who were children attending that school contributed
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.800]   some amount financially to our high school education in order for
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.520]   my parents to be able to foot the bill for that.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.000]   >> You worked.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.760]   >> Yeah, so I worked.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.240]   And from the time I was seventh grade through the time I graduated high school,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.600]   I paid, it was a token amount of my memory, it was about $100 a month.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.880]   But I paid my dad $100 a month to support my school, which was great.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.520]   I really, really value the experience of that, and it did a lot of good in me.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.400]   That was the deal all the way through.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.720]   So it did a lot of good in me.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.920]   But going to this rich school where majority of your friends come from,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.640]   wealthy backgrounds.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.800]   I mean, there were people in my class whose parents were Major League Baseball
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.120]   players and retired NFL players and business people, etc.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.520]   You're surrounded by a lot of wealth.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.640]   And so when you're in that type of circumstance,
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.440]   when your family is not the wealthy family, it's easy to have some insecurity.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.240]   And because my parents were very modest, I was frustrated with that.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.560]   And so I wanted to develop my own, I wanted to be rich.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.640]   I wanted to be rich like all my friends and not have that insecurity,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.400]   not have those inferiority complexes.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.080]   And so that drove me a lot even through college,
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.160]   where when I entered into college, my goal was to be a Fortune 500 businessman.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.000]   And I wanted to be a corner office CEO.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.280]   I loved reading business books.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.600]   I loved reading business magazines, and I identified with that.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.680]   And I really wanted to be rich.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.480]   And it wasn't until God started working on my heart through college that I was able
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.120]   to start to give a lot of that up through a pretty intense process,
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.720]   where the intense motivation to be rich came away.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.560]   So answering your question in two parts.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.800]   Number one was I really wanted to be rich, but I didn't know how to do that.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.320]   And so my parents didn't teach me a lot about money in terms of,
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.960]   my dad didn't buy me stocks and go over the business pages.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.680]   My dad was always very practical, very, very careful.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.400]   My mom was a great shopper, very frugal.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.240]   I mean, you have to be when you're raising a family of seven kids
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.360]   on a single income.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.080]   You have to be a great deal finder.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.400]   And so they taught me some good basics, and I learned a lot of good lessons.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.720]   But I always felt like they didn't know how to be rich,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.320]   because my dad was not a big investor.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.320]   He wasn't a real estate tycoon or a business tycoon.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.280]   He was just a simple electrical engineer.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.040]   So when I was looking for that information,
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.280]   I fell prey to the world of get rich quick, especially
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.960]   even to the world of real estate.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.680]   I remember distinctly when I was a freshman in college
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.840]   how I had gotten involved-- and this would have been graduate high school
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.200]   2003, so this would have been 2004, 2005.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.520]   So we're right in the middle of the 2000s, the real estate boom.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.840]   And I had started reading books on real estate.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.560]   I had gone to a success seminar with a friend of mine.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.360]   And while I was there, the real estate speaker,
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.560]   the way these success seminars work, they bring you in.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.760]   Everybody gives a hoorah motivational speech, and then that follows up,
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.800]   and you sign up for the following seminars.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.120]   So the real estate speaker piqued my interest,
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.000]   because he taught me that I could be a multimillionaire with no money down,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.880]   starting with nothing, in about three or four years.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.160]   So I signed up for that three-day seminar.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.040]   And I remember distinctly, a buddy of mine,
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.000]   we went down to Miami for the three-day seminar.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I live in West Palm Beach, now we're north of Miami.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.160]   And we went down to Miami for the three-day seminar.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.480]   And as we're there at the seminar, I was so completely sold, so sold,
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.600]   that I was ready to sign up for the $30,000 real estate coaching package.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.440]   I was looking around, trying to find where can I get the money.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.640]   I had a few thousand dollars.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.400]   I was going to borrow the money.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.040]   And I vividly remember, I went to lunch with my dad and my brother.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.640]   And I vividly remember my dad basically just putting his foot down.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.720]   I was 19 years old, but I'm basically saying, Joshua, do not do it.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.000]   And thank God I listened to him.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.600]   I didn't sign up for the super awesome guru coaching package.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.920]   I didn't put down my $30,000.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.440]   But through a variety of circumstances, I was paying for my college education.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.120]   And I had received some scholarships, but fewer than I had anticipated.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.120]   So I worked my way through my freshman year.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.840]   My sophomore year, I started borrowing money
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.960]   to make up the difference, because I felt like I was working too hard.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.560]   And I wasn't committed to going through without borrowing money.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.280]   And so I wound up starting to borrow money.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.200]   And during my junior year, my brother had gotten a hold of--
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.960]   had started listening to Dave Ramsey's program on the radio.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.160]   And he had bought the book My Total Money Makeover.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.680]   And he gave me a copy of it, because he knew I liked money and finance.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.360]   I read the book.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.320]   And the first time I read it, I was like, this guy,
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.040]   doesn't he know that you're supposed to use other people's money to get rich?
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.360]   Hasn't he attended these real estate seminars that I have,
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.160]   and known how the power of leveraging and compound interest works?
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.960]   So I read it again.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.280]   And I still thought he was dumb.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.920]   But the third time I read it, it really struck me.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.320]   And I realized.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.640]   I said, if you had no payments, how much money would you have?
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.080]   And that just stuck with me.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.280]   And so I decided that I was going to get out of debt.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.560]   And this was my junior year.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.220]   I decided I was going to get out of debt.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.280]   So I was working hard.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.920]   I had dropped out of school.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.080]   I'd taken a semester off.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.280]   I say dropped out of school.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.520]   My wife corrects me and says, you took a semester off.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.680]   But I had studied abroad.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.280]   And I came back.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:46.960]   And I quit college.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.120]   Because I didn't know what I was doing and why I was doing it.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.520]   And then I started working on paying off my debt.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.520]   I worked very, very hard.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.960]   And my senior year, I took a full course load, 19 hours of class per semester.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.200]   I worked like crazy.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.160]   I lived on nothing.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.840]   I cash flowed my senior year of college.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.520]   And two weeks before I graduated, wrote a check
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.960]   to Sally Mae for all of my student loans.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.680]   And I graduated from college completely debt free.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.400]   My goodness.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.680]   It was a remarkable thing.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.080]   I worked a lot.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.400]   But it taught me something.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.200]   Because I had the best year of my life.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.920]   And the skills that I had to use to get there
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.240]   are skills that to this day have been very important for me
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.560]   and have also been really crucial in my own self-confidence.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.240]   In order to get there, as an example, I had to make a proposal to my bosses
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.640]   to allow me to go from working traditional 40-hour office
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.040]   hours to working flexible hours.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.760]   So I could work them around my classes.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.640]   And so I was in working at night, working in the morning,
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.960]   scheduling everything around--
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.800]   I dropped my pen--
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.680]   scheduling everything around my classes.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.920]   And same thing, I had to schedule every single hour of my week
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.560]   in order to figure out when I was going to work, when I was going to do this,
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.000]   when I was going to do my homework.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.440]   And I just had about six hours a week of free time
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.720]   scheduled, a couple hours on Saturday night, Sunday morning till 2 PM,
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.960]   and then I was back to work.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.120]   But the results of it were really, really powerful.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.480]   And so those experiences were, for me, very, very transformative
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.040]   and really laid the foundation to some of the good things
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.440]   that I've experienced since then.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:16.920]   Amazing.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.640]   Most people have a financial awakening post-college.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.720]   You had it sort of during your college years.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.360]   Where were you working during the time?
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.040]   What kind of jobs did you have?
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.880]   So I studied abroad.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.680]   When I came back, I didn't have a job.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.560]   But I got into a conflict with the dean of the business school.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.640]   And I wanted to pursue a certain course of action.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.680]   He denied me.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.840]   And so in a huff of spite, I dropped out of school.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.480]   I called a former boss of mine that I'd worked a couple years for in high school
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.440]   who managed a sod farm and a tree nursery.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.800]   And so I started working with him.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.160]   And so he put me in charge of his tree nursery.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.040]   So I was working in agriculture.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.200]   And agriculture is tough, because you've got to start the guys at 6 AM.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.960]   Most of them are minimum wage workers.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   And if they don't get 60, 70 hours a week,
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.800]   they don't make enough to make it worth them.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.280]   So you've got to start at about 6 AM.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.520]   And I was kind of the foreman there to open up the gates
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.660]   and get everything started.
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.960]   So I got to be out there early.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.000]   And you work late.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   So after about three or four months of that, I had switched.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.400]   And I had gotten a job at a large company doing graphic design,
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.920]   minimum graphic design.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.520]   And so I was working for the company.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.240]   And that was who I worked my way through college,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.600]   doing graphic development on our organization's presentations
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.640]   to clients.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.840]   Man, so that must have felt incredible to be leaving school
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.800]   without debt like that.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.640]   Did you call up Dave Ramsey and say I'm debt free?
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.140]   I did.
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.400]   I think I did.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.240]   Yes, I did.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.020]   I'd forgotten that.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.080]   But I did call him.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.280]   And I did do a debt free scream at some point.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.440]   And more to the point, what it allowed me--
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.720]   here's an interesting part of the story.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.360]   At that time, I organized--
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.920]   he has this product called Financial Peace University
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.640]   that he organized himself.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.320]   And I was such a Dave Ramsey fan boy
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.880]   that I bought the whole course.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.640]   And I organized all of my friends
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.800]   to go through the course.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.680]   And we were doing it in our living room type of thing.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.600]   And in that course, in one of the previous versions
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.320]   that I had bought to show to all my friends,
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.680]   he talked about how if you have an emergency fund,
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.480]   that when you get laid off, you can laugh.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.520]   And you can say, ha, ha, ha, how big is the severance?
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.400]   So after I graduated from college,
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.360]   the job that I was doing during college I knew
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.000]   was not something I wanted to continue after college.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.240]   And one of the agreements that I had negotiated with my employer
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.040]   was that they had agreed to give me an extra scholarship
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.720]   stipend, basically, free money to go back to school in exchange
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.320]   for my considering staying with them full time when
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.240]   I graduated from college.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.880]   I think they saw the natural skill and hard work and work
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.360]   ethic and ability that I had.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.080]   But they recognized that I would need some training
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.360]   and some molding.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.760]   Well, when I called my bosses after graduation
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.680]   and I said to them, OK, I'm ready to talk,
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.800]   they said, oh, sorry, we don't really have anything.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.520]   Maybe you can continue as you're doing.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.160]   And I just said, no, I don't want to.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.120]   So I quit my job.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:57.640]   And I left.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.760]   And I took this great 13,000 mile road
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.560]   trip all around the United States.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.040]   And as I was leaving by myself in my $2,000 car
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.400]   with 193,000 miles on it when I left,
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.080]   it was a great, great experience.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.720]   But when I was leaving on my last day of my going away
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.600]   party, my boss says, hey, we've been working on something.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.280]   Come see me when you get back.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.320]   So I got back from my about two month road trip
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.560]   all around the United States.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.040]   And I went to see him.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.320]   And he offered me a job with a substantial raise
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.400]   and a change in position from this graphics development
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.520]   role into basically an entry level analyst position.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.960]   I did that for a year.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.280]   And then I got laid off.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.320]   And the point of the Dave Ramsey scenario
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.440]   is when I got laid off, it was out of the blue.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.320]   I had just gotten a substantial pay raise, like an 8% pay
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:41.880]   raise.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.480]   I had glowing reports of all the things.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.120]   I was involved in all these products.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.800]   And I remember when I'm sitting there,
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.160]   had a meeting with my bosses, and I was clueless.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.240]   And I remember them talking to me.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.000]   And all of a sudden, I figured out I was getting laid off.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.760]   And it was such a shock to me.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.320]   Because I thought, in order to get laid off,
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.200]   like I thought anybody who gets laid off
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.840]   deserves it in the sense of if you've gotten laid off,
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.360]   it's obviously because you're bad.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.520]   Like you're just not an asset to the company.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.840]   I had this idea that laying off and getting fired
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.120]   were synonymous.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.760]   And here I was getting laid off.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.320]   And it deeply hurt my pride.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.040]   Because I knew I was a hot shot, right?
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.960]   And so I remember just kind of nervously laughing
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.640]   when I finally figured it out and saying,
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.960]   how big is the severance?
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.880]   And then seeing this shocked expression on their faces,
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.960]   like, huh?
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.520]   And then I went on and explained.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.680]   And I said, well, sorry.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.600]   I didn't mean to be disrespectful.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.800]   But I've been preparing for this.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.560]   I got out of debt.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.680]   I saved my six months emergency fund.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.400]   So I'm really just happy that I did all those things so
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.040]   that I can make it through this new experience of being
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   laid off for the first time.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.640]   So you quickly had to put into practice
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.360]   the laughing about the situation.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.880]   So what was next for you?
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.200]   So from there, I didn't know what I wanted to do.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.640]   And let me rephrase that.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.640]   I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.880]   But I knew that the job I was doing as an analyst
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.480]   was not a good fit for me.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.240]   In hindsight, I think I was there a little bit more
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.040]   than a year.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.440]   And during that year, I was in the corporate world.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.640]   And I had always thought that the corporate world would
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.360]   be great.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.440]   I had, in many ways, a job that if I spun it the right way,
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.920]   I could make it sound very fancy.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.200]   I had the company credit card.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.720]   I'd gone on the corporate trips and fly here and get
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.200]   the black car to the hotel.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.400]   And I just realized, this is not for me.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.360]   I don't want to do this.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.600]   And I was giving myself to it.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.120]   I was there an hour before everyone else.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:36.800]   I was there late.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.720]   I was just doing everything.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.960]   And I realized, this isn't a perfect fit for me.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.600]   So along the way, one thing that I did well
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.520]   that really helped me a lot is I always
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.720]   kept good notes to try to understand myself
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.000]   and understand what I liked and what I didn't like.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.320]   And so I kept notes of jobs that I thought would be fun,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.480]   companies that I thought would be fun to work in,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.160]   industries that I thought would be cool.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.960]   And that would be as simple as Panera Bread.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.160]   I always liked Panera Bread.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.120]   I thought it had a cool atmosphere.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.240]   I thought it would be fun to work in a Panera Bread.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.320]   Or if I were in a hotel, I always liked to travel.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.760]   And I thought, if I worked in the hotel business,
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.560]   I could travel.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.360]   And that would be a cool industry I would like.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.080]   And I would also keep note of attributes of certain jobs
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.680]   that I liked.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.800]   I learned that I didn't like sitting in an office.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.160]   I like to be out and about.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.720]   So when I was laid off, I had this list of a couple hundred
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.560]   jobs-- I still have it-- jobs, business ideas,
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.920]   everything from as simple as starting a lawn maintenance
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.920]   company, just all these ideas.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.400]   But I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.480]   In searching it through, and I pursued
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.120]   a lot of introspection and good note-taking,
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.520]   I had come up with five criteria for a job that I wanted.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.960]   For example, I realized I didn't like being paid for time.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.160]   I don't want to be paid for the hours that I put in.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.820]   I want to be paid for what I produce.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.240]   I want to be paid for performance, not for time.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.560]   I realized that I didn't like working for one-time rewards.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.400]   So I sat down.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.720]   I don't want to be paid for do this job, be done.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.920]   I want to be paid, do this job, and have
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.280]   a revenue stream, an investment that could continue.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.840]   And there were three more.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.120]   But I was sitting down when I was leaving.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.240]   I had been a good employee.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.560]   And after I was laid off, my boss
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.640]   said, hey, listen, give us a couple weeks and give us a call.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.240]   We'll do anything we can to help you.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.400]   So I went out to lunch with one of the presidents
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.560]   of my company who had laid me off a couple weeks later.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.480]   And there were no animosity, no ill feelings.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.240]   They were just eliminating my job position.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.240]   And I was fine with it.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.040]   They saved me needing to go.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.560]   And in hindsight, it turned out to be a good thing.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.960]   And I laid out these five criteria that I had for a job.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.880]   So he told me, he said, have you ever considered
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.600]   the world of financial services?
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.520]   I said no.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.960]   And primarily, I was heavily, at that time,
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.000]   heavily influenced by the world of personal finance.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.120]   So my theory was that brokers are out to make you broker,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.600]   insurance is a total scam, I can do better on my own.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.960]   I was an index fund guy.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.280]   I was a do-it-yourselfer.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.240]   I was like, I'm a do-it-yourselfer.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.480]   But his son had interned at a company
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.760]   called Northwestern Mutual.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.880]   And he said, listen, my son did this internship.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.920]   He had a great experience.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.200]   You should go and look at it.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.560]   So I went and had an interview.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.320]   And when I interviewed with the Northwestern Mutual rep
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.760]   that his son had worked with, I was extremely impressed.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.380]   Because the man who was interviewing me
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.880]   was a Navy nuclear submarine.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.200]   He was a CFP, CLU, CHFC, like a very credentialed,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.160]   just a really relaxed, really knowledgeable guy.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.280]   And it opened my eyes.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.360]   Their recruiting literature and information
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.520]   opened my eyes to the possibilities,
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.000]   the financial possibilities, the business possibilities,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.360]   the way the business worked.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.920]   And that opened my eyes to the world of financial services.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.800]   So then I spent a couple of months basically
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.720]   researching as many people and companies
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.120]   in the financial services business that I could find.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.360]   I interviewed with a bunch of different people.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.520]   And then ultimately, I went back and joined
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.800]   Northwestern Mutual in the fall of 2008,
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.200]   starting as a 23-year-old life insurance salesman.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.760]   And so in the fall of 2008, I started my financial services
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.520]   practice and did that until July of 2014
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.680]   when I left to build Radical Personal Finance.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.440]   Cool.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.640]   Very good.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.400]   Let's get into a little more detail in terms of the--
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.640]   obviously, you weren't getting into any more debt
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.280]   post-college, it sounds like.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.280]   No, I did.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.280]   No, you did.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.400]   What debt did you take on?
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   On multiple occasions.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.000]   I'll tell you the worst of it.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.480]   Probably the most humbling experience,
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.960]   the most difficult experience for me,
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.880]   was when I was building my business initially.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.760]   And financial services is an interesting business
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.120]   because it's a profession.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.040]   And like many professions, it requires some degree
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   of knowledge and experience.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.960]   But it doesn't pay like most professions.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.440]   And some companies, depending on the different structure,
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.280]   have different salary structures, et cetera.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.320]   But in the financial services business,
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.880]   the beginning years are extremely, extremely low-paying
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.640]   years.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.400]   And they're low income because it takes a while
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.040]   to build momentum in the sales process
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.160]   where you have a large base.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.360]   And it takes a while to build personal skills in terms
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.920]   of knowledge where you can help larger clients, where
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.320]   you can make more money.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.080]   And it's a very expense-intensive business.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.240]   So all of your compensation in the financial services
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.760]   business comes on the back end.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.440]   So first 10 years of your career,
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.240]   you're dramatically overworked and underpaid.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.320]   Maybe second 10 years of your career,
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.720]   you're probably about properly compensated for the amount
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.800]   of work that you do.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.120]   And then from then on, if you continue,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.920]   it can just be a cash cow where you're just
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.360]   dramatically overpaid for very little work in many ways.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.120]   And so that was what I was working towards.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.920]   Well, along the way, I was quickly
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.520]   limited based upon my ability for my business to expand.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.680]   And I was overworked, was working a ton.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.080]   And so the path in that process is that you hire help.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.560]   You go ahead and hire staff.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.200]   And you hire staff to come and help you
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.160]   with some of the simpler things.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.640]   And so I began that process.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.760]   But as a new business owner, it was the first time
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.960]   that I had ever done that.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.200]   So I hired a couple of people, had great employees.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.360]   But I didn't make up in production
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.280]   what my staff was costing me and my staff
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.780]   and all of the associated expenses--
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.200]   their computer, their office space, all that stuff.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.400]   Rather, what I did was instead of working so much,
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.720]   I worked less.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.200]   And so my income stayed about the same.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.280]   And my expenses went up during that crunch time.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.120]   Because the way hiring works, when a company hires,
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.600]   usually they're at overcapacity.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.040]   They don't need somebody full time.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.320]   They need 10 hours a week.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.400]   And so they're overcapacity until, for a while,
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.140]   they can bring the work up to the capacity
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.640]   that the employee has.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.120]   And then they'll be undercapacity.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.120]   And they go and hire.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.280]   But the business owner, when they hire,
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.920]   is always the one who's on the hook and who's overpaying.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.400]   And so in that stage of my business,
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.160]   I didn't need somebody full time.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.120]   But I hired for the future.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.520]   And I started borrowing money.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.600]   Well, it took a while until finally one day I woke up.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.440]   And I just sat down.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.520]   And I was looking at my numbers.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.420]   And I realized that I'd put myself thousands and thousands
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.500]   of dollars into debt, money that I didn't have anything
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.760]   to show for except the work that my staff had done.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.220]   That was very, very humbling.
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.440]   Because I would never, never give the advice to somebody
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.080]   else, hey, listen, what you should do
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.040]   is you should go and borrow money to pay
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.320]   for somebody else's salary.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.520]   That is stupid.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.840]   You shouldn't do that.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.320]   And yet I had done it myself.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.560]   And so I laid off my staff.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.640]   I collapsed my office.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.880]   And I worked like crazy to pay that back.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.280]   And talk about eating humble pie.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.640]   Here I am, a financial advisor.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.100]   I'm supposed to have a clue.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.020]   And I made a stupid business decision
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.120]   that I should never have made.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.360]   In hindsight now, I'm very thankful for it
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.400]   for a number of reasons.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.800]   But the primary reason that I'm thankful for
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.720]   is it allowed me to eat a good dose of humble pie
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.600]   and learn a little bit more empathy
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.360]   with people who make mistakes.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.600]   Because I've always been such a good learner,
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.560]   the challenge of that is that I've often
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.760]   thought that I knew what to do.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.080]   I learned by making some very expensive mistakes
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.960]   that just because you know something
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.400]   doesn't mean you can do it.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.480]   And it gave me a great deal more empathy
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.920]   of working with other people who've
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.480]   made financial mistakes that I wouldn't have had
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.600]   if I hadn't had that experience.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.760]   - Yeah, what kind of loan was it?
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.480]   - Credit cards, I just put it on credit cards,
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.440]   0% credit cards.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.800]   - Gotcha, can you disclose how much it was?
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.160]   - I think it was like $15,000, I don't remember exactly.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.000]   - Gotcha. - Something like that.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   - So essentially using a credit card to float the payroll.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.800]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.640]   - Gotcha.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.460]   - Okay. - I mean the world,
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.840]   when you have good credit, that's the most common form.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.700]   Number one, most new businesses are financed
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.760]   with some form of debt.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.740]   Should be or not, that's a discussion to have,
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.580]   but they are.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.380]   And the simplest form of debt that most people use
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.640]   is 0% credits.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.360]   And it's a very simple process to do it.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.720]   And because it happens incrementally,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.040]   because the way that you do that, if you have revenue,
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.260]   what you do is you use the revenue to pay your hard costs,
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.080]   to pay your rent, to pay your staff,
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.600]   to pay your taxes, all of that,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   and then you use 0% credit cards
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.160]   in order to pay those expenses.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.200]   And so when you don't manage that,
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.360]   it causes the problem to where you wind up
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.760]   spending too much money.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.240]   And no question, it is an inefficient thing.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.680]   And because it's easy, I spent way more,
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.240]   I didn't need to do it, it was stupid of me.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.720]   I should have just stuck to my guns
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.840]   and not borrowed money and things like that.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.200]   One question, you mentioned index funds.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.240]   And so I know coming out of the Dave Ramsey world,
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.280]   you weren't necessarily taught about index funds.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.320]   How'd you pick up that knowledge?
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.040]   - Well, that was just reading personal finance.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.000]   And I was in the, I remember,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.560]   I think I'm at Lazy Man's Retirement Portfolio
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.400]   or something like that,
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.640]   was the first book I read years ago
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.040]   that introduced me to index funds.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.160]   I am not an advocate of index funds.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   Neither am I an opponent of index funds.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.720]   And so when I was a financial advisor, I didn't use,
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.160]   so in the financial planning business that I built,
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.880]   first few years, I focused primarily on life insurance,
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.520]   disability insurance, long-term care insurance,
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.640]   and health insurance.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.040]   Because when you're new and when you're young,
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.880]   you can learn enough about insurance
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.800]   in a couple of months of hard study
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.640]   to be really useful to people
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.840]   and give good insurance advice.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.760]   It takes years to learn about investing.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.240]   But over the years, I went through
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.120]   and I built up my knowledge in financial planning.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.280]   I got my charted life underwriter,
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.080]   wound up becoming a certified financial planner.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.320]   I later got a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.320]   Along the way, I changed my business.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.240]   And I changed from insurance primarily
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   to investment primarily, to working with retirees.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.280]   And in those portfolios, I used both actively managed funds
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.880]   and passively managed funds for different clients.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   So that's always been, I'm not an index-only guy,
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.520]   nor am I an opponent of the indexing.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.000]   I think in general, many people,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.080]   most people will be better off with an index approach.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.200]   But even though most of the academic literature
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.940]   is against me, and I have to admit that,
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.320]   I still have a soft spot for several active managed funds
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.960]   and the approach of active management.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.940]   And I think it's a little bit more nuanced.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.320]   So I'm not a, anyway, those are my thoughts on indexing.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.960]   - Yeah, I got it, I got it.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.360]   I'm always interested in someone who's working
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.800]   in financial services like that,
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.880]   how working for your own company like that
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.480]   affects your personal finances.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.120]   So how are you saving for your own retirement
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.920]   during that time?
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.680]   - Well, I think it's important to recognize,
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.560]   and this is what I don't like
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.320]   about the financial services business,
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.680]   and I've taught people, is that as a financial advisor,
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   you need to recognize why it is
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.160]   that you're actually getting rich
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.200]   and how other people get rich.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.920]   And here's the truth as I see it.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.040]   You don't get rich by investing in mutual funds
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.680]   inside your IRA or 401(k).
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.000]   That's a great sales pitch in a book.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.680]   There's no reason why that can't work.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.520]   It's just that most people who are rich
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.920]   did not get rich that way.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.000]   And again, hear me clearly.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.960]   It's not that it can't work.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.320]   But in my years of working with wealthy clients,
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.780]   I didn't have hundreds,
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.800]   but I had a couple of dozen very wealthy clients,
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.400]   and I met with hundreds of millionaires
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.920]   and multimillionaires.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   I only had one client who had actually built their wealth
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.680]   through that path, through the path of saving
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.080]   and putting money in their 401(k).
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.000]   In this case, he was an educator at college.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.320]   He wound up becoming a higher ranking university official.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.720]   And he just earned a multi-six figure income over time,
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.680]   was a pretty frugal, relaxed guy,
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.540]   just chucked it aside in a 403(b) and it worked.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.160]   But that's not the norm.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.660]   Most people in the United States who become wealthy,
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.360]   become wealthy because number one,
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.320]   they have a high income, i.e. professionals,
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.960]   or number two, they build a business.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.440]   Those are the two things.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.920]   And so it's exactly the same thing
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.760]   for somebody like a financial advisor.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.200]   The reason a financial advisor,
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.200]   and this is a nebulous term,
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.640]   but let's just think someone like me,
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.240]   someone who was working in financial services.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.660]   The reason a financial advisor becomes wealthy
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.920]   is not because they make great investment decisions.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.560]   It's just simply because they earn a lot of money
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.960]   because it's a lucrative, very difficult business.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.700]   And if they save some of that money consistently,
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.380]   then they'll be able to grow.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.960]   So that's kind of the big picture.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.720]   Don't be misunderstood.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.180]   The reason most financial advisors are wealthy
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.360]   is not because they're great at giving investment advice.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.840]   It's because they're good at building a business,
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.560]   selling a lot of product, and saving some amount of that.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.360]   Now, with regard to your specific practice,
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.920]   here was how I approached it.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.040]   Number one, my company offered,
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.020]   and this is an important diversification tool.
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.060]   As a financial advisor,
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.680]   I didn't place a heavy emphasis on stocks.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.360]   I own stocks, and I invested a small amount of money there
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.700]   to make sure that I would understand what it was.
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.160]   But it was largely my IRAs and Roth IRAs
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.740]   that I had established since I was 18 years old.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.020]   But as a financial advisor,
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.620]   and I would not give the advice to a financial advisor
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.320]   to invest heavily in stocks.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.360]   First, I had two traditional pensions
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.180]   as far as defined benefit pension programs
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.340]   that I was involved in,
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.340]   which didn't require contributions from me with my company.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.260]   In addition to that, as I grew,
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.860]   I was investing primarily into my business,
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.500]   copying what my rich clients did,
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.780]   which means instead of putting money into an IRA,
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.400]   I would hire staff or expand my office space
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.020]   or buy more marketing, et cetera.
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.620]   That's the way that you do it.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.100]   That's the way that you really build wealth, not IRAs.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.120]   And concurrent with that,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.020]   I was looking and focusing on diversifying my income
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.060]   out of stocks.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.220]   Because as a financial advisor,
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.820]   especially one who manages money,
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.420]   your compensation, if you're doing fee-based planning,
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.980]   where you're receiving, let's say 1% of the assets
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.180]   that are under your management,
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:07.100]   your compensation is based upon the amount of the accounts
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.740]   that are under your stewardship.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.240]   And so the goal is grow those accounts.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.820]   But the problem is, what do you do when things go wrong?
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.060]   So remember, every three years,
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.100]   you should expect about a 33% decline
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.440]   in the value of the stock market.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.020]   So that can bring tremendous volatility to your income.
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.980]   If your investments are experiencing a 33% decline
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.780]   at the same time that your income is receiving a 33% decline,
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.140]   that's a bad plan.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.460]   So as a financial advisor,
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.140]   I was intentionally focused primarily
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.500]   on diversifying my income
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.380]   and my plan was to diversify out of stocks
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.820]   so that my income and my investments
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.900]   would not be connected.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.940]   And this is the same problem that people face
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.800]   when they invest in their company stock.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.920]   Generally a bad idea, because if the stock,
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.200]   if your income is affected, you're getting laid off,
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.840]   it's also gonna affect your investments.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.480]   So right when you can least afford to handle it,
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.720]   you're facing a double whammy.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.240]   Same thing for financial advisors.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.080]   - Gotcha.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.600]   So were you investing in the business
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.000]   forsaking things like maxing out your Roth IRAs?
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.040]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.120]   - Okay.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.640]   Dave Ramsey wouldn't have said to do that.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.280]   - But that's exactly what Dave Ramsey's done.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.520]   Dave Ramsey is rich,
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.340]   not because he put money in a Roth IRA into mutual funds,
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.580]   he's rich because he built a huge business
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.000]   that was completely leverageable and completely scalable.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.040]   And this is the problem with financial advice.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.500]   It's great financial advice to say to somebody,
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.380]   someone like you, okay,
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.100]   when you were working as an accountant,
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.540]   if somebody's an accountant
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.160]   and they're an established career accountant,
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.540]   putting money into an IRA is a perfectly reasonable thing.
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.440]   But you will never be as rich putting money into an IRA
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.060]   as you will be if you make partner
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.860]   or start your own accounting firm, if that works.
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.900]   So the thing to recognize is,
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.220]   it's not that the plan can't work.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.860]   It's just simply that it doesn't work.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.260]   And the data proves that it doesn't work
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.220]   for the majority of people.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.660]   Majority of people in the United States of America
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.060]   have no retirement savings, they don't save money.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.840]   And the majority of the wealthy didn't get there
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.680]   because of putting money in the 401k.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.560]   So the reason that people have a million dollars
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.680]   in the 401k is not because they made great,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.820]   you know, financial decisions.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.720]   The reason they usually, most people get there
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.500]   is because they make a multi six figure
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.060]   or a multi six figure income.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.340]   And so they can easily afford to put the max in it.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.180]   And you do that over the course of a decade
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.940]   or a couple decades and it grows.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.820]   So that's one of my major messages is to recognize,
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.980]   do what works, not just what you're told.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.760]   And putting money into, you know,
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.460]   just simply working a job,
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.460]   putting money into a 401k or an IRA,
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.660]   nothing wrong with it,
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:33.240]   but it's really good for the financial services industry.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.820]   And I'm convinced it's not the best thing
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.220]   that most people should be starting with.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.280]   - Yeah, could you do a hybrid approach though?
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.480]   - Sure, absolutely, and that's a great idea.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.220]   So all good financial advice
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.900]   is gonna be intensely personal.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.740]   - Right. - Okay?
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.780]   That's a big deal for me.
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.860]   If you wanna make a mistake,
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.420]   if you wanna demonstrate how little you know about finance,
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.260]   just give broad sweeping advice.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.500]   Now we all do it, I do it,
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.460]   but what I mean is you can't give good financial advice
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.020]   until you get the details of it.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.500]   So let's say for example, as a financial advisor,
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.020]   if I was going to put money and the scope,
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.620]   $5,000 is different than $15,000.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.860]   Let's say I had the choice between saving $15,000
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:15.240]   into a Roth IRA or into an IRA or defined contribution plan
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.580]   that would allow me to contribute to it,
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.060]   that it would grow, okay?
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.900]   Well, what do I get?
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.820]   I get a little bit of a tax deduction now
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.420]   and I get whatever growth those mutual funds give me.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.860]   But now let's say I can take that same $15,000
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.940]   and I can use that to buy four months of labor from somebody.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.540]   Now that four months of labor is completely tax deductible.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.860]   And the benefit of that four months of labor,
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.780]   if I can hire a full-time staff person for four months
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.580]   who can go out and help me manage my marketing campaign,
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.380]   who can help me do less $15 an hour work,
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.220]   'cause I can hire $15 an hour work,
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.620]   and help me do more $1,000 an hour work,
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.060]   the benefit in my pocket could be multiple six figures
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.300]   at the end of the year.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.780]   So it would be really foolish in the beginning
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:59.340]   to focus on putting $15,000 aside when I should invest.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.340]   And so this is what is important.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.220]   In business, you should focus primarily on the business
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.000]   in the early years.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.500]   Now there does come a point in time
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.060]   at which you need to diversify out of the business.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:14.900]   In the beginning years,
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.060]   the best investment that you have
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.100]   is gonna be the business.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.160]   And so it's foolish to pursue other things.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.260]   Why would you let Coca-Cola manage your money
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.960]   when you can put it in and you can get 1,000% return?
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.980]   It's silly in the beginning for people
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.100]   who have these options, a business owner
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.420]   whose income is not tied to their hourly work,
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.580]   who's not limited based upon 168 hours that they have total
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.180]   and the 60 to 80 that they can work consistently.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.820]   A business owner has huge exponential opportunities.
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.340]   So it's silly in the beginning to put that money into an IRA.
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.340]   But down the road,
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.660]   you have to diversify out of your business.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.060]   And that's where you have excess money.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.780]   That's when you tuck it aside and you say,
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.820]   listen, Coca-Cola is probably not gonna do well
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.660]   as FinCon Enterprises will,
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.420]   but FinCon Enterprises could blow up
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.760]   and go away two years from now
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.340]   because I have a competitor that comes in
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.980]   and all my people like him better than me.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.180]   And so there's a transition stage.
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.900]   It's not that one is right or one is wrong.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.140]   It's a matter of when do you focus on which
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.180]   one of those options. - I like that.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.260]   Yep, yep.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:13.540]   Managing your cashflow, managing your money on a daily basis
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.300]   during this time period of your life,
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.420]   do you use actual budget sheets?
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.260]   Do you use credit cards and pay them off every month?
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.340]   Like what's the more strategic or tactical
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.140]   money management systems you had set up?
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.740]   - Yeah, this was the most difficult thing for me.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.420]   All during the time that I was a financial advisor,
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.220]   I haven't had a steady income since I was 23 years old.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.660]   So I'm 31, so it's eight years now.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.940]   I haven't had a steady, consistent paycheck.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.940]   And so managing a variable income
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.780]   with a high degree of variability
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.180]   is very, very challenging.
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.780]   Most money I ever made in a month was,
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.100]   I think it was like $31,000 a month.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.980]   I went multiple months when I made nothing.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.580]   And I went and made months where during this,
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.340]   the weird thing of financial services
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.460]   where I owed my boss money for the privilege of working.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.300]   It was a remarkable thing.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.780]   But managing that degree of instability
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.300]   is very, very challenging.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.620]   So over those years, all during the time
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.020]   that I was a financial advisor,
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.940]   I'd simply used some custom spreadsheets
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.020]   that I built myself.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.500]   And I used my custom spreadsheets
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.300]   to manage and to track everything.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.840]   And that worked for me.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.980]   It was after I started Radical Personal Finance
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.100]   that I started using the YNAB software,
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.740]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.820]   That was when I started using the YNAB software.
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.380]   And the YNAB software, the You Need a Budget software,
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.940]   is awesome.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.900]   If I had used You Need a Budget,
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.540]   if I had used their software all during the time,
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.380]   and the problem was, I told Jesse Mecham this
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.700]   when I interviewed him on the show.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.860]   I said the problem was I had the first version of YNAB
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.580]   when I was interested in software.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.420]   And I thought it was a spreadsheet,
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.220]   and it was a spreadsheet at that time.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.740]   Well, I made a better spreadsheet myself.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.820]   But I didn't keep track of what YNAB was doing
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.080]   when they were iterating through
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.780]   and they got out of the spreadsheet world
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.140]   and they made an awesome app, application.
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.640]   If I had used YNAB during that time,
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.700]   I'd be a lot richer today
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.560]   just because it's so, so good.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:06.740]   - If you've been listening to the podcast for some time now,
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.860]   you've no doubt heard me mention MediShare.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.940]   MediShare is the medical sharing program for Christians
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.700]   that I use to cover me and my family of five
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.320]   instead of regular old health insurance
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.360]   purchased through the Obamacare exchange.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.340]   I've been on MediShare for over three years now
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.740]   without any issues.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.740]   We still use the same doctors we always have.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.060]   Here's the thing, I used to pay over $1,000 a month
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.500]   to insure my family.
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.460]   Now with MediShare, I pay just $235.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.260]   There are a few more out of pocket expenses on this plan,
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.700]   but overall, the program saves me thousands each year.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.460]   I've been able to save more and enjoy more
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.100]   of my hard earned money thanks to this program.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.580]   Look, there's a ton on the line when it comes to you
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.260]   and your family's medical needs.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.540]   So visit PTMoney.com/MedishareReview
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.340]   to see all the pros and cons of this program.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.440]   I hope you discover if it's right for you.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.520]   - What is one area of personal finances,
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.200]   obviously you've become a master of your money
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.320]   at this point, but what's one area
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.880]   of your personal finances that you're still
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.360]   just not good at?
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.760]   (laughing)
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.320]   - This pause here is gonna sound really arrogant.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.800]   There's no way to answer a question like that properly.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.920]   - Yeah, we can be specific or theoretical.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.120]   - Probably the biggest challenge for me,
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.200]   the biggest thing that hurts me, financially speaking,
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.160]   is that at this point in time,
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.880]   I don't think I'm a very good businessman.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.480]   As far as the day-to-day management of checking accounts
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.640]   and things like that, that at this point
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.920]   is a learned and practiced skill.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.680]   I've done enough crisis financial counseling
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.640]   with people who are in that.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.840]   That's the blocking and tackling of personal finance.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.300]   It's the basics that you have to do well.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.840]   If you don't do that well, it's gonna be very difficult
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.360]   to do well, but it doesn't take that long to learn.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.880]   And so the basics of handling personal checking, et cetera,
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.320]   is pretty simple.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.720]   Now, you may not know this, but I actually have
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   a pretty unique financial situation
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.240]   in terms of a couple of things.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.920]   Number one, for both business reasons
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:09.440]   and personal ethical reasons, I no longer own any stocks.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.440]   And the primary reason that I did that,
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.280]   including retirement accounts, things like that,
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.200]   all of my tax-deferred accounts
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.120]   are simply sitting in cash at the moment.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.520]   And the primary reason was because I closed
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.800]   my financial planning business after six years
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.680]   to start Radical Personal Finance.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.280]   And during that period of transition,
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   it would be foolish for me to have my money
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.000]   exposed to stock market volatility risk
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.820]   when I have use for it, potentially,
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.360]   in building this business.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.480]   Because once again, the opportunities that I face
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.100]   with building Radical Personal Finance
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.860]   and trying to create the empire that I wanna create,
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.400]   the opportunities are so much bigger
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.560]   than what the VTS whatever can get me
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.120]   from the whatever index fund
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.080]   or whatever American funds mutual fund that I wanna have.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.960]   It's incomparable, it's night and day.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.200]   But the financial risk of starting a business is tremendous.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.120]   And so first of all, there's important
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.960]   when you're making major transitions,
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.080]   don't be scared to move your money to cash.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.800]   I think this is something many people are scared to do.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.040]   Don't be scared to move your money to cash.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.440]   Now, if you've got millions of dollars in cash,
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.840]   you don't need to move your other millions over.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.860]   But when you're somebody like me who's still building,
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.080]   I don't have millions of dollars yet,
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:18.920]   I'm working hard on it, but--
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.200]   - Do you share publicly how much that cash is?
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.240]   - No, I won't.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.080]   I don't and I won't.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.240]   I don't see any benefit.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.240]   When people share numbers,
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.160]   I don't know if you do or not, maybe you do,
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.600]   but I have never seen somebody who has shared details
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.240]   on their personal finances,
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.620]   who wasn't doing so with the intention
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:35.680]   of selling more product because of it.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.780]   I am deeply suspicious of somebody who publishes
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.080]   things like income reports, net worth reports,
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.720]   unless they're doing so as a component
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.160]   of like a debt payoff plan.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.600]   But beyond that, it's very,
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.040]   it merges into the world of pyramid marketing.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.600]   And all of the rich, in the sense of look at me,
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.020]   look how rich I am, so come and do what I do.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.920]   And I see no benefit of it.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.260]   I teach, one of the things that's very important to me,
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.040]   and that I see wealthy people do,
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.800]   is in general, I think you want to practice a lifestyle of,
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.140]   I mean, the best term for it is stealth wealth.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.900]   People should never be able to look at your lifestyle
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.320]   and understand how much money you have
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.400]   or don't have because of it.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.520]   Because if you look at the wealthy,
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.140]   the people who are truly wealthy,
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.600]   you'll often won't have any sense of how wealthy they are
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.400]   based upon looking at their lifestyle.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.280]   So, long-winded explanation to say,
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.240]   I don't do it because I don't want anyone,
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.320]   number one, it's my business and there's no benefit to me.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.640]   There's only negatives to me.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.840]   Unless I'm selling something that's gonna try to show you
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.920]   how you can make money like I make money,
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.800]   there are no positive benefit to me
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.520]   to talk about how much wealth I have or don't have.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.080]   There's only negative consequences.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.360]   - Yeah, just looking for context for the conversation of,
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.040]   is this a significant retirement stash
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:51.920]   that we're talking about?
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.320]   Because that's a significant move
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.440]   to move that all into cash.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.920]   Or is it 10 or $15,000?
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.760]   - I'll just say this.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.000]   I've been saving diligently since I was about 18 years old.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.280]   I've made financial mistakes.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.140]   I've made financial mistakes.
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.360]   I consider myself to be a wealthy person,
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.400]   but I'm not a millionaire.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.800]   - Gotcha, that's all I needed.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:11.680]   - Yeah, so my assets, and let me home in on that
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.440]   because obviously some of the statements
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.800]   can be misunderstood.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.040]   One of the things that I don't like actually
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.160]   about our modern world, and I have a real beef
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.280]   with the modern financial advice,
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.980]   is sending people into primarily things
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.040]   like retirement accounts before they have the opportunity
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.800]   to get their hands on money.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.760]   If you look at most people's financial situations,
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.600]   when you're beginning off life,
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.960]   a few thousand dollars, perhaps $10,000,
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.400]   can buy somebody a tremendous degree of flexibility.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.360]   I can't quote this stat off the top of my head,
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.120]   but I would guess, and I don't think
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.080]   this is directionally wrong.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.840]   I don't have the stats at my fingertips,
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.240]   but probably if you have a few thousand dollars
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.360]   of liquid cash, you have more cash available to you
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.920]   than perhaps 50% of the country,
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.840]   in terms of 50% of the population.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.420]   That might not be exactly right,
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.560]   but it's directionally right.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.680]   If you've got $100,000 cash, I'm convinced
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.140]   you've got one of the major stages
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:13.440]   of what I define as financial independence in this sense.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.400]   If you've got $100,000 cash, you have the ability
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.160]   to go anywhere in the country you wanna go,
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.280]   to take any job that you wanna take,
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.920]   or to start almost any business that you wanna start.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.960]   And one of my biggest beefs with the financial industry
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.760]   is the first thing that we wanna do
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.160]   is put that $100,000 into 401ks and IRAs,
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.920]   instead of putting that first $100,000
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.320]   into savings accounts.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.940]   Now, there are good reasons why we advocate for that.
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.000]   Most people spend all the money that they have.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.480]   And so if you can put a little distance
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.040]   between people and their money,
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.240]   it's probably gonna be in their own best self-interest.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.080]   But if somebody doesn't have the connection
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.520]   between the amount of cash that they have
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.980]   and the amount of money they spend,
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.800]   I'm convinced it's far better to put that $100,000
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.460]   into a savings account and have it available to them,
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.540]   not in a retirement account.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.880]   For you, when you were leaving your CPA job,
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.560]   I don't know how much money you had saved,
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.000]   but if you've got $100,000 sitting in the bank,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.200]   then that buys you, you know that you've got
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.200]   a couple of years worth of runway.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.800]   But if that $100,000 is sitting in a 401k,
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.420]   you're much more nervous about it.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.240]   So I guess the question you asked me,
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.880]   which I got away from was, I've lost the question.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.760]   I was preaching at you.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.760]   What did you want me to answer
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.840]   about investment diversification?
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.720]   Was that where we were?
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.400]   - I think I've forgotten as well, Joshua.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.440]   - Okay, so I was answering the question about investment.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:37.000]   So I moved it to cash for the reason of stability
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.640]   when starting my new business,
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.360]   in order that if I needed to access the money,
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.680]   it would be available to me.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.940]   And number two, I moved it for ethical reasons.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.160]   I became comfortable with the conduct
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.920]   of many of the large companies that represent companies,
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.280]   such as those that are listed
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.660]   on the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.400]   I've realized that there are many, many more options
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.720]   available to me to invest money.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.800]   So I have bootstrapped Radical Personal Finance,
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.760]   working on the side while building up the business
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.760]   so as to not have to touch invested assets.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.240]   But it's been an important safety net for me along the way.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.600]   And in terms of my own personal financial planning,
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.440]   a couple of things.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.160]   Number one, my business has tremendous potential.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.020]   2016 has not been the year that I hoped it was,
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.760]   but 2017, I'm very excited for the prospects
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.380]   and I've got some solid plans
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.780]   because of the hard work that I put in
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.280]   over the last couple of years.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.200]   I also have looked at the economy
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   and I have become convinced myself that there will be,
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.160]   I've said for a year or so, I expect,
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.440]   I don't know whether it's this year
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.360]   or sometime in the next year, couple of years, who knows?
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.280]   I expect us to be back again in recession.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.840]   And I have become deeply appreciative
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.780]   of how the business cycle can be a tremendous value
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.960]   to somebody in their quest
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.600]   to acquire deeply discounted strong assets.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.000]   I think there's a mistake.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.880]   Most people associate the efficient market hypothesis
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.020]   with all markets.
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.320]   The idea is that the efficient market hypothesis,
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.840]   there are three forms of it,
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.400]   but the strongest form says,
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.880]   well, you just can't make any choices in the stock market,
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.440]   buying and choosing what stocks to buy or choose
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.440]   and expect to profit
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.160]   because you know when to buy and when to sell.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.800]   - The future gain is already built in.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.640]   - Right, exactly.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.800]   Now, let's pretend that we grant that to be the fact.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.900]   That doesn't apply to every market.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.780]   Just because the stock market might be efficient
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.340]   doesn't mean that every market is efficient.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.180]   - Sure, okay.
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.100]   - And so one of my big focuses
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.500]   is to seek to move from markets that are efficient
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.080]   where I have no competitive advantage,
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.700]   such as the broad-based stock market,
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.020]   to markets that are inefficient
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.300]   where I can find a competitive advantage with my investing.
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.440]   So for example, I've been preparing,
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.480]   if we go into recession,
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.500]   I expect the simple example of real estate
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.340]   to be substantially devalued
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.860]   through the course of that recession.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.020]   And so if you wait till the back end of a recession,
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.640]   real estate is the deep discount.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.820]   You can walk in, you can negotiate excellent deals,
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.980]   and you can buy things at good assets at good prices,
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.140]   simple things like that.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:09.100]   And there are many alternatives for that as well.
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.020]   When I was a financial advisor,
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.060]   I had a number of business owners, clients,
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:16.180]   and I learned this through watching that, for example,
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.860]   one of my clients created fencing products.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:23.860]   During the 2008 to 2012 economic turmoil,
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.540]   systematically, one by one,
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:28.220]   all of his competitors went out of business,
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.060]   and he bought them out for pennies on the dollar,
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:32.720]   and he now owns a huge, massive business.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.140]   But it came because he had cash sitting ready
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.260]   to buy up his competitors when they were desperate to sell.
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:39.080]   - Interesting.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.220]   So let's talk about the future for you.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:44.340]   Do you have any future personal finance goals
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.420]   that you've set for yourself,
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:46.920]   and what's your plan to achieve them,
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.220]   maybe outside of the business, if you have them?
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.260]   - Yeah, I've got tons of them.
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.420]   I mean, I've got goals of,
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.100]   I wanna be careful with the things that I share,
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.060]   'cause not all of my goals
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.300]   am I willing to talk about publicly.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.440]   But I am working towards building financial independence,
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:05.620]   as defined by my ability to live and support my family
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:09.100]   without the need to be engaged in active employment.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.700]   I am working on that,
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.100]   but it is not a primary motivator in this sense.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.980]   There's nothing that I'm doing now.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:22.780]   There are very, if I were today financially independent,
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.580]   I would continue doing the majority
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.060]   of the things that I'm doing.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:29.940]   I have achieved a significant degree
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.020]   of financial independence,
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.700]   in the sense that I'm not beholden to anybody.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:37.540]   Nobody has control over what I do or don't do,
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:39.260]   what I say or don't say.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.340]   For me, one of the major definitions
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.800]   of financial independence is that 168 hours of your week
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.580]   are yours to say, do what you want to.
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.100]   And I've intentionally built a business
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.180]   that doesn't require me to account for those,
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.060]   to be accountable to anybody for those hours.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.220]   So I've achieved most of the financial independence goals
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.620]   in terms of lifestyle goals that I want to do.
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:01.220]   But I don't have any interest in quitting working.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.820]   I don't have any interest in retiring.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:04.140]   I think it's a very bad idea.
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.100]   And so I'll continue to build in the business
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.380]   and the businesses.
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:11.860]   And I have very significant long range cultural goals,
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.700]   family goals, changes that I wish to see worked in the world
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:19.080]   that I will be pouring every dollar and ounce of energy
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.900]   and sweat into over the next decades of my life,
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:23.480]   if God gives me those decades,
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.940]   in order to see happen.
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.340]   - Give people a quick snapshot of what the business does
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:28.740]   and how you make money.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.620]   - Yeah, it's a, come back in a year
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:33.500]   and I'll probably be prouder of the answer.
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:38.500]   So when I began it, I didn't begin radical personal finance
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:39.940]   with a solid business plan.
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:44.140]   And the reason that I didn't was because I had a hunch
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:49.140]   that there was a desire for significant types of information
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.780]   financial information in the marketplace,
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:54.220]   and that I could meet that need,
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.620]   but I wasn't sure about it.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.680]   And so I had a goal to build a media business,
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.780]   but building a media business is about a solid
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.900]   of financial plan of saying,
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.840]   I'm gonna become a multimillionaire
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.800]   by becoming a bestselling author.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.640]   Well, it can work.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.520]   JK Rowling has become an incredibly wealthy woman
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.960]   because of her Harry Potter series.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.840]   But just because it can work doesn't mean
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.480]   that there's a high probability of it working.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.240]   And so when I started radical personal finance,
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.080]   I did so in this understanding.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.360]   If I could build an audience
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.720]   and if I could build a platform,
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.180]   there were dozens and dozens of ways
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.400]   that I could earn a living from that.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.780]   If I couldn't build an audience,
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:30.880]   I couldn't build a platform,
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.720]   and there was almost no way to earn a living from that.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.000]   So when I closed my financial planning practice,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.400]   I got a part-time job,
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.280]   which was sufficient to pay for my income.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.640]   And I started creating the podcast.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.000]   And you can go back and listen in the archives of the show,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.320]   episodes 11 through the first couple hundred
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:48.080]   are all during that first year, and I made no money.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.040]   After that point in time,
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.280]   the audience started to become substantial enough
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.340]   that I have started to work
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.000]   on a variety of different things.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.880]   I tried to start a membership site.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.880]   I had a bunch of people sign up for that,
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.440]   but then it didn't work for various reasons.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.560]   I took on advertisers on the show.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.680]   I had a bunch of people sign up for that.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.280]   Some things were great, some things were not.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.860]   I've done a bunch of things.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.160]   The primary basis of the business is the podcast
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.360]   at this point in time.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.760]   And so as a component of the podcast,
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.560]   I'll just tell you what we're doing going forward.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.440]   My audience supports me through a tip model
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.480]   using a website called Patreon.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:20.640]   It's basically, they say, "Hey, Joshua,
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.560]   we appreciate what you're doing,
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.880]   the hard work you do for us.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.480]   We wanna send you some money for it."
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.000]   I am building a number of self-help financial products,
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.680]   trying to give people good, solid, practical answers
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.360]   to their questions that they will be willing to pay for.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.880]   I'll be bringing on more advertisers
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.500]   and sponsors to the business,
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.680]   and then building it out with, you know, systematically,
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.760]   whether it's live events, other products and services.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.320]   Once you have the audience, once you have a platform,
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.880]   there are dozens of ways to earn a living from it.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:49.880]   And it's all based upon actually having the platform
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.640]   and having the audience.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.960]   - Well, cool, man.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.900]   Good explanation about the business.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.080]   Congrats on all the success with that.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.200]   Always ask entrepreneurs these questions of,
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.240]   what are you doing?
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.800]   Do you have any specific retirement accounts
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.440]   for entrepreneurs now that you've started on your own world?
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.560]   Well, I guess you sort of were before
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.400]   with your own practice,
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.440]   but have you done anything different there?
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.020]   And what do you do about health insurance?
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.200]   - Yeah, so with those two things,
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.460]   there's kind of two ways to that.
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:20.480]   There's number one, there's advice to entrepreneurs.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.000]   The SEP IRA is powerful.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.800]   The Solo 401(k) is incredibly powerful.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:28.400]   If an entrepreneur wants to participate in a 401(k),
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.640]   you can set up a Solo 401(k)
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.640]   and you do the right paperwork in the right way.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.320]   I mean, we can set that thing up.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.760]   You can put 50 grand a year in there, and it's fantastic.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.080]   And you can do all kinds of interesting things within that.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.560]   You can do a self-directed Solo 401(k),
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.020]   and you can invest in all kinds of interesting investments.
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.020]   So that's some of the stuff we talk about
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.740]   in Radical Personal Finance for entrepreneurs.
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.860]   For me, however, at this point in time,
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:55.540]   I'm not making any contributions to retirement accounts,
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.720]   and I'm not particularly keen on doing so.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:02.720]   I haven't decided that I am not ever going to participate
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.620]   in retirement accounts,
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:09.460]   but neither is it a priority for me.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:11.600]   After spending, I would say,
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.640]   from the time I was 18
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.660]   through probably the last couple of years,
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.060]   which is called 2006,
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:21.180]   when I was starting to really gain an appreciation
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.660]   for alternative forms of investing,
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:28.340]   having come from the world of IRAs and 401(k)s,
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.280]   and now being in the world that I'm in now,
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:34.540]   I am far less keen on the use of tax-qualified accounts
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:39.540]   as a valuable tool on the way to financial independence.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.880]   And I'm far more keen on the flexibility
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:47.040]   that one can have when not participating in those schemes
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.080]   and the diverse types of investments
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.040]   that people can make of all manner of things.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.380]   So at this point in time,
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:57.640]   I'm not participating in any 401, any retirement accounts,
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.320]   and I'm not particularly keen on returning to that.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.640]   And just one comment
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.100]   that your listeners might find interesting,
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.400]   I have often felt like the black sheep.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.880]   I'm the pariah of the, you know,
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.080]   here I am, you know, financial planner, blah, blah, blah.
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.240]   And I hold this opinion,
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:16.120]   and this very low opinion of retirement accounts.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:21.120]   I was speaking with a prominent public financial planner,
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.500]   active financial planner,
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.680]   also active financial planning guru
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:26.760]   in the world of professional financial advice.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.360]   And I was sharing with him my opinion.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.360]   And he said to me this, he said,
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.880]   "Joshua, I haven't put money
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.920]   in my retirement accounts in 10 years."
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.680]   He said, "I have got so many other business opportunities
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.880]   that are so far more exciting to me."
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.920]   He said, "I haven't funded my accounts in 10 years."
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:45.040]   And I realized that, okay, I'm not the only one.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.660]   Retirement accounts have their place,
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:49.940]   but I think people have made it
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:52.760]   more of an unfounded ideological
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.600]   or just an unfounded kind of emotional commitment
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:58.680]   rather than truly assessing them
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:01.760]   and their benefits and drawbacks objectively.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.560]   - So with your particular business,
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:07.840]   have you invested funds to this point already?
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.800]   - Yeah, I mean, I got a microphone here.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.320]   (laughing)
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.520]   I got a computer.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.640]   - I guess what are the significant investments, I guess?
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.280]   - Well, I would say the most significant investment
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.580]   is the opportunity cost.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:20.840]   That's always what it is with business.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.480]   I walked away from an extremely lucrative business.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.400]   I walked away from a very established business.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:29.480]   I walked away from hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:30.980]   in my pension plans.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.840]   I walked away from thousands of dollars per month
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.520]   of renewal and residual income.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:38.660]   I walked away from a huge amount of money to do it.
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:42.400]   So the biggest cost to me was that,
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.880]   was what I gave up by closing my financial planning firm
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.520]   in order to start this business.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.160]   I'd do it over again in an instant,
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.540]   but that was a tremendous financial cost.
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:55.440]   I chose a business that did not require tremendous capital,
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.120]   financial capital to work in.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.520]   And I think this is one of the most important things
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.020]   with giving good advice.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:05.000]   You should always seek to play in a market
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.020]   where you can be dominant based upon your assets,
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.400]   your attributes, and your skills.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.200]   Here'd be two examples.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.680]   I don't have millions of dollars,
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.120]   so I'm not gonna go out and try to develop strip malls
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.580]   or do new real estate development work.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:23.640]   But I do have years and years and years of study
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.840]   and of experience in financial planning.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.680]   And so I chose to go into this world,
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.320]   the world of financial media,
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.320]   because I have a high competitive advantage
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.420]   that gives me a significant advantage
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.040]   over many of my competitors.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.360]   And I didn't need a lot of money to play in this space.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.920]   I needed a microphone and internet connection, et cetera.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.080]   The expenses of my business are very low.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.440]   So this was, as I have analyzed my own situation,
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.640]   the ideal form of investment for me.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.720]   Now, as my assets grow and my time becomes more valuable,
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.680]   I'll move into other areas
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.420]   where my assets give me a competitive advantage.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.160]   If you have millions of dollars,
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.480]   don't go and play in the same sandbox
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.960]   where people with $5,000 can compete with you.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.320]   Go and compete in a market
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.400]   where you have many fewer competitors
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.800]   and where you do have a competitive advantage.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.040]   Important investment principle.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.040]   And so I'm putting my money where my mouth is
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.120]   and following my own teaching
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.000]   with regard to how I invest at this point in time.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:19.840]   - Gotcha.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.680]   Does your wife work?
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.500]   - Yeah.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.600]   (laughing)
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.120]   We've got two kids, man.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:24.960]   (laughing)
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.800]   - Ah, okay.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.160]   - I've got two kids and a third on the way.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.280]   - Fair enough, fair enough.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.700]   - Does she create an income?
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.560]   - So I'm intentionally calling you out on it
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.520]   because you have hit a very sore point for me.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.400]   I have a deep ax to grind with society
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.200]   and how we have trained an entire generation of people,
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.120]   especially a generation of women,
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.760]   to measure themselves based upon their financial earnings.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.320]   And I'm sorry, but you and I are more than a paycheck.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.140]   My value and my worth is not dictated
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.680]   by how much money I earn.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.720]   And my wife's value and her worth
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.200]   is not dictated by how much money she earns.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.680]   So I have a deep ax to grind
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:06.100]   because we despise the roles of mothers and fathers
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.200]   in our society.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.000]   And we try to teach people that somehow you should play
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.720]   on this economic playing field,
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.120]   that somehow the work that she does in our home
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.280]   with our two children is less valuable
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.900]   than her going and earning some random paycheck
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.520]   by helping make a corporation richer.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.840]   So I intentionally caused you an awkward moment there.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.680]   - No, I appreciate it.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.320]   And I'm old and bored fully.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.080]   - So the answer is my wife does not bring in
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.400]   active earned income to our household.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.960]   - Okay, so back to the health insurance then thing.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.000]   So how do you guys do the health insurance?
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.940]   - I participate in a healthcare sharing program
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.840]   called Samaritan Ministries, which is fantastic.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.960]   I used to sell health insurance.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.120]   And I'm actually, when we hang up this interview,
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.620]   I'm about to do the fifth in a series
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.440]   that I've done on my show for health insurance.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.880]   And I'll be talking about healthcare sharing ministries.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.560]   But I used to sell health insurance.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.840]   And after the passage of the Affordable Care Act,
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.400]   the health insurance marketplace
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.000]   was just absolutely destroyed by the Affordable Care Act.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.880]   Now, some people were happy, some people were unhappy.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.360]   It opened up insurance at cheap costs,
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.880]   much cheaper costs to many millions of people,
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.700]   but it also changed the pricing of the market.
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:16.060]   And so when that happened,
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.200]   I got out of the health insurance marketplace.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.560]   And we participate in healthcare sharing ministry.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.460]   So it works, we don't have health insurance.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.100]   It's a voluntary organization
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.760]   that is exclusively available to Christians.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.800]   You basically have to affirm to a statement of faith
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.540]   and certain lifestyle practices.
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.480]   But then the people who are involved in this organization
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.160]   choose voluntarily to share in one another's health costs.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.320]   So if my wife and I incur doctor bills, we submit that.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.640]   It's published to other members,
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.920]   and the other members send us checks to pay for that.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.480]   So right now, we're expecting another baby.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.280]   And the midwife bill is basically five grand,
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.700]   or $5,500.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:57.440]   So I have right here on my desk the notice of publishing.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.080]   So that's been published into the network.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.900]   And starting next month, we'll start getting checks
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.380]   from all of our fellow members,
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.500]   totaling up to the cost of the midwife bills
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.580]   for our forthcoming baby.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.660]   - Very cool, very cool.
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:13.640]   Familiar with it, but we'll link to it in the show notes
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.780]   for people to find out more about that program.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:17.060]   We use MediShare ourselves.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.820]   So we've talked about it a few times as well.
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:20.660]   Well, very cool, man.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.960]   Last question for you.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.120]   Since that moment in your life
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.480]   when you decided to become a master of your money,
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.360]   the ups and downs, the positives, the negatives,
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.800]   how do you feel about it all now?
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.440]   - Here's what I've learned.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:37.440]   I used to think that if I just had money figured out,
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.960]   all of my problems would be figured out.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.200]   Now, for those listeners who are younger,
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.560]   they'll probably relate to that.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.800]   For those listeners who are older,
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.080]   they'll probably think, well, that was naive.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.960]   And I wholeheartedly admit that that was naive.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.260]   But I always thought, well,
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:53.160]   if I just reach the next financial goal,
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.480]   then everything will be better.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.140]   I remember so deeply when I was working crazy
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.080]   to get out of debt.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.280]   I was so committed to get out of debt goal.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.840]   And then I got out of debt and I was lost.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.520]   And I was like, well, what now?
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.520]   I've since learned that's a common experience.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.360]   It's a common experience,
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.540]   not only for people achieving financial goals,
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.440]   but it's also a common experience
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.520]   for people achieving any kind of goal.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.520]   Well, okay, what now?
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.800]   I've lost that sense of purpose that I was working towards.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:21.240]   So I used to think that if I just figured out my money,
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.360]   to use your nomenclature,
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.920]   if I just became a master of my money,
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.560]   my life would be great.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.840]   I've since realized that that is a total bogus.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.920]   It's totally false concept.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:34.200]   You can have a great life with very little money.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.520]   Money will exaggerate some problems
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.600]   and don't minimize other problems.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.040]   I don't believe that,
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.840]   although I'm thoroughly in favor
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.600]   of excellent money management,
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.800]   I'm thoroughly in favor of building wealth,
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.720]   I'm thoroughly in favor of these things.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.240]   You can't look to them to do something
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.640]   that they're not gonna do.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.320]   And so I remember reading that Ross Perot,
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.400]   he was asked one time if he was happy,
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.000]   as a multi-billionaire.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.560]   And he said, yeah, I'm happy.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.640]   He said, but I'm no happier than I was
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.320]   when my wife and I were,
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.160]   when I was in the army,
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.800]   my wife and I were living in this little tiny
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.640]   officer's quarters on the army base.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.920]   And I think back to that.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.920]   And my wife and I, we sold it a year ago,
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.560]   but we had a big fancy house,
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.920]   three bedroom, two bath house,
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.800]   fancy neighborhood, et cetera.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.640]   That's a goal that many people wanna have.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.720]   Now, was I happy when I had that big house?
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.320]   Sure, it was nice.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.160]   But you know what?
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.000]   For the first year of our marriage,
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.400]   we lived in a 234 square foot studio apartment
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.400]   that we paid $500 a month for
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.960]   in downtown West Palm Beach.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.520]   And we loved it.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:37.760]   I have since disconnected any expectation
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.360]   of things like happiness or satisfaction
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:43.360]   or fulfillment from finances
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.560]   and from financial management.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.680]   There are many reasons,
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.840]   important reasons to focus on your money.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.640]   And it's important to lower stress to achieve security.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.280]   Financial security does bring an additional level
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.200]   of happiness to a family.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.480]   My wife, if we have lots of money and savings
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.320]   and we're not overspending our income,
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.200]   my wife's stress level is significantly reduced.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.840]   It brings her a sense of financial security.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.280]   That has an overwhelming positive effect in our family.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.040]   So I don't wanna minimize it too much.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.080]   But I do just wanna recognize that don't look to money
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:18.880]   and think that if I only have, I'm gonna be better.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.480]   The reality is you're gonna be the same person,
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.800]   whether you're rich or whether you're poor.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.640]   You're gonna be the same person
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.760]   whether you're experiencing great success or not.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.160]   You're gonna be the same person.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.040]   - I like it.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.840]   Good advice, good way to end the show, man.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.320]   Thanks so much for being on.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.120]   Where can folks find out more about you
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.360]   and all that you have happening?
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.640]   - Best way, if you wanna listen to the show,
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.960]   just search the App Store on your phone
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.800]   or any podcast app directly that you have.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.200]   Search for Radical Personal Finance.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.680]   Of course, the website is at radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.800]   But the tagline of my show is living a rich life now
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.680]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.880]   in 10 years or less.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.320]   Both of those things are important.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:54.680]   Living a rich life now in every sense of the word
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.480]   while also building a plan for financial freedom.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.120]   And so we'd pursue those things.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.280]   My show comes out probably four times a week
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.120]   at this point in time.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.160]   It's kinda quasi daily, but four times a week.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.360]   And I try to keep the content extremely diverse.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.680]   So one day we talk about
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.020]   some simple personal finance thing.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.780]   The next day we talk about some complex discussion
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.560]   of financial planning.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.360]   The next day we talk about some aspect of lifestyle.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.440]   We do various interviews.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.940]   I try to keep the show extremely diverse.
