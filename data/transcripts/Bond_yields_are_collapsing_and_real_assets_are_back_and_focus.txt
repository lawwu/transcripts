[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and it's Monday morning, March 13th
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.200]   Temporarily, we've been saved as the Feds have decided to backstop all depositors for Silicon Valley Bank
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.800]   They've shut down Signature Bank in New York, and they've also backstopped all depositors. So this is great
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.160]   however
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.000]   US regional bank stocks continue to sell off
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.720]   Western Alliance down 70 plus percent First Republic down 60 plus percent Zions Bank Corp
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260]   Down 40 plus percent PacWest down 40 percent
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.960]   Comerica 33 percent fifth third down 20 percent. So it's not looking good for the regional banks
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.620]   Unfortunately, and the Fed will likely have to do more and since the Fed showed it is willing to backstop
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.560]   Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.560]   It will inevitably have to backstop any other bank that experiences a bank run and fails
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:07.080]   Otherwise contagion right? We know what will happen. I do want to point out that the feedback I receive from my newsletter
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.480]   Which has about 55,000 subscribers
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:17.160]   Was pretty good. You can sign up for my newsletter at financial samurai.com forward slash news because I was thinking there would be a
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.080]   Number of readers who would reply with nasty comments saying the depositors are not innocent
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.440]   They knew the FDIC limit is 250,000. So they should have diversified across multiple banks
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.400]   Haha, they deserve to lose their money, but surprisingly
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.260]   Only one reader one reader who seems pretty wealthy
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.240]   So the depositors are not innocent victims and they should have known better
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.000]   And it's just a weird kind of feeling because I don't feel good about anybody losing money and I don't feel
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.680]   depositors
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.980]   Deserve to be told you should have known better when they were just busy doing their business
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.960]   They trusted an institution that would take care of them. But suddenly they turned from
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.040]   Depositors to creditors to me. That's insane. I don't wish ill on anybody. And so this schadenfreude this
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.120]   feeling of joy and the suffering of others
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.520]   I feel it is a terrible feeling that needs to stop and I'm pleased
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.880]   I'm really pleased and proud of the financial samurai community
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.960]   For not being that way because if you go on Twitter if you go on social media
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.980]   You'll see a lot of people who are just finding the joy and the failure of others
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.560]   And I don't know what's going on with these people, but that just doesn't seem right to me
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.480]   So thank you for inspiring hope in humanity
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.920]   So the aftermath we're currently living it now the futures were up huge on Sunday evening
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.000]   But then the markets opened up flat to down on Monday March 13th. There's still a lot of work to be done
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.760]   What is interesting to note is that the 10-year bond yield has collapsed from 4%
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.400]   down to 3 and a half percent and below that in a one-week time period and the two-year bond yield has
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.640]   Collapsed from 5% to 4% in three days
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.840]   So this shows there's a lot of fear
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.440]   There's a lot of assets going into Treasury bonds, which are supposedly the safest asset
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.440]   They are the safest asset, but they're not safe if you have to sell before holding
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.320]   to maturity
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.800]   Because when interest rates rise these bond prices fall and that's what happened with Silicon Valley Bank
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.120]   They decided to sell something like 21 billion dollars worth of their long bond holdings
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.520]   To try to change the duration and match it more properly to their deposits as a result
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.720]   They were hit with a 1.8 billion dollar loss and the sad part of it is that Silicon Valley Bank
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.640]   Temporarily, it looks like they sold tens of billions of dollars of long-term Treasury bonds at the bottom of the market
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.800]   Because now the bond market has rallied
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.520]   So it's really
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.920]   important for banks to match their
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   Duration liability with their assets and I'm sure many regional banks and all the bigger banks will be
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.880]   Hedging against interest rate risks in the future as a result. Maybe fees will go up for
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.800]   Consumers maybe profitability will go down for banks
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.240]   What I do know is that I think economic calamity was knocking at our doors
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.320]   But this time the Fed realized it could not let these banks fail
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.440]   So we came up to the edge to the cliff's edge and then we walked back
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.600]   We're not out of the woods yet
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.840]   But I think the worst case scenario has been avoided
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.120]   I think the Fed gets it if you look at the terminal rate the futures
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.640]   Expectations of the Fed Funds terminal rate. It was at around five point two five percent of five point five percent
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.520]   right more Fed rate hikes of
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.360]   25 base points for the next two sessions at least but now
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.440]   Expectations are for maybe only one 25 basis point rate hike
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.520]   Goldman Sachs my old shop came out with a note on Sunday evening saying it expects no Fed rate hikes anymore
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   Nothing in March and that's it
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.600]   So the terminal rate the terminal Fed Funds rate expectations has now declined to about four point eight five percent
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.880]   So that's in the middle of no rate hikes anymore and one last 25 basis point rate hike
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.520]   So this is a positive for the economy for consumption for risk assets
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.420]   and I do want to highlight that there will be a
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.520]   refocus on real estate and other real assets you can touch and
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.080]   Utilize that also generates income
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.060]   There's so much funny money out there and I never thought cash would be considered funny money
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.560]   But with the bank run at Silicon Valley Bank and other regional banks
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.240]   cash, unfortunately is
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.960]   Being moved towards the funny money category and I've written about this in past
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.560]   The key to getting rich is turning funny money into real assets
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.380]   So in 2021, we had a lot of funny money with
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:28.480]   speculative stocks with cryptocurrencies with NF T's of meme stocks and the keys to take some profits and convert that into
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.520]   real assets like real estate because that'll help increase your chances of
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.920]   Preserving that funny money wealth that was created
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.400]   I'm taking a deep look at my net worth allocation right now
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.440]   and I'm disappointed in 30% of my net worth because it consists of the stock market and the stock market has been terrible in
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.960]   2022 and pretty much flat right so far for 2023 and then now I'm looking at my venture capital
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:03.580]   Money, I'm like kind of disappointed in you guys too because there's been the run on banks these private market valuations
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.240]   Are kind of not real you just don't really know what they are
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.880]   But the good thing is I don't see them every single day
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.640]   So they don't really stress me out and it's not a huge percentage of my net worth at about 5%
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.480]   But again, it's kind of like funny money right now
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:24.860]   So then I move on to my treasury bond holdings and I'm looking at these guys and thinking I'm proud of you all
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.760]   Your banker is the United States government. It's not going bankrupt
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.660]   You're yielding 4% 4 and a half percent 5 plus percent most recently keep at it guys
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:41.840]   Keep the dream alive. Now. Finally, I'm looking at about 50% of my net worth in real estate
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.120]   and I was disappointed in real estate for a while because
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.760]   Mortgage rates have risen so quickly it depresses the value of my real estate holdings. However, I'm also
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:08:00.120]   Appreciative. I'm also proud they are still standing and generating rental income and providing shelter
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:07.800]   For our family and my tenants. There's no tenant turnover yet knock on wood and there haven't been too many problems
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.600]   Except for that funny fire alarm that we found beeping inside the walls because my contractor
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.760]   Decided to close the walls and not take it out beforehand
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.940]   So I say let's pay attention closely to real assets
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.360]   Once again, it can be real estate fine art
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.780]   fine wine
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.460]   Anything that provides joy and value and can generate a return in income that's tangible
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.440]   It's looking
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.540]   Relatively more attractive again. I'd like to conclude this podcast episode with another thought process
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:48.960]   Imagine you took out 10 mortgages worth 10 million dollars across various
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.480]   Failing regional banks. How would you feel? I think you'd feel nervous
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.080]   confused maybe a little scared
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.240]   But eventually you might think hmm
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:08.100]   Do I not have to pay any of these mortgages back or will they maybe just forget about it after they go into receivership?
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.860]   Don't really know
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.400]   Probably you're gonna have to end up paying that money back, right? There's just really no free lunch
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.260]   But it's a different type of concern
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:24.300]   I don't think you'd be as afraid anymore because you are the one who actually owes them money and you might be able to get
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.780]   A free lunch now sooner or later that free lunch needs to be paid
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.900]   But for the moment, maybe things are looking better for you
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:39.420]   it's just a thought process to think about how you want to spend your money how you want to borrow your money and how you
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.600]   Want to allocate your net worth across various assets
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.620]   I think we are blessed to be able to borrow money and upgrade our lifestyles and live beyond what we can afford with cash
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:57.400]   And if we borrow so much money and then we unfortunately pass away do we lose or do we win in the end?
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:03.960]   It's something to think about. All right, everybody keep safe. Keep strong. Keep aware
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.780]   I'll keep on writing and recording as much as I can. This is really
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.700]   Unbelievable times right now and we've got to pay attention
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:19.660]   If you've enjoyed this episode, please share with a friend if my words have given you any sense of solace or comfort
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:26.180]   I'd love a positive review and if you want to support my book by this not that you can check it out at financial samurai.com
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.740]   Stay strong everyone.
