[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 51.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Today's show, Friday Q&A, we're going to cover a lot of ground.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   We're going to dig into accounting, accrual accounting, and cash method of accounting.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   We're going to dig into double entry accounting and single entry accounting.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   We're going to talk about using Roth IRAs as emergency funds, what to do and what not to do,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   how to do financial planning for elderly people.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   We're going to talk about business ideas and how to get started in business.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And we're going to discuss some not so happy feedback about my recent Walmart show.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Do I have any accurate understanding of what goes on with Walmart and am I a racist?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. I appreciate you being here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Today is Episode 51 for Friday, August 29, 2014.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I'm looking forward to today's show. We're going to cover a lot of ground.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   This is going to be an intense â€“ it is going to be intense.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   It's going to be a show of intense variety.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And I hope that you find it interesting.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   This is what I love to do is to mix everything up.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   [Music]
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's been a great week on the show. I've really enjoyed the shows that I've produced for you.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I hope that you have found them beneficial and helpful.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I've gotten some good feedback from them.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I want to lead off this morning just with mentioning I finally, finally, finally was able to get the audio feedback line set up for you.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   So if you go on the website now, you will see I set up SpeakPipe.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It is evidently the best program to use if you ask all the techie people about that.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   So I set up SpeakPipe. So SpeakPipe.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   So if you go on the website, either on your computer or on your phone, you can see a little send voicemail button on the right-hand side.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And if you just click that button, it will allow you to record right with your computer and with your phone.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   So it will use the onboard speaker for your computer or you can use the onboard speaker on your smartphone.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   It doesn't have a 1-800 line or anything like that associated with it.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I hope that doesn't make a difference at this point.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I thought you can set some of those kinds of things up, but it seems like this is a little bit simpler.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And it seems simpler to me if you're going to -- just as simple if you're going to pull your phone out while you're driving and send me a voicemail,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   you might as well just do it using the Internet connection versus the 1-800 line.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   So if you feel differently, let me know.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   If I need to set up some kind of 1-800 line or something like that so you can leave me a voicemail, please do that.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   But my hope is that -- I want to keep doing these Friday Q&A shows.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And today I'm covering questions that I've received via email and comments on the blog.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   But I want to open this up and start doing audio feedback questions as well.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So you can ask a question. You'll have about three minutes to record it, although I'll try to keep it shorter than that.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   But let's figure out kind of what works and what doesn't when I see what kind of questions come in.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So I'm going to record the question on the site and send it in.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And I will play the audio on the show.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So hopefully that will give a little bit of the phone situation and allow me to continue talking about a diverse set of topics on Fridays,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   which is something that I want to do.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I really think that adds a lot.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And I will enjoy hearing from many of you, and I'm sure that you will enjoy hearing from many of your fellow listeners.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So I'm going to lead off this morning.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So there's going to be a lot of topics, and I think it will be fun.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I think it will be a good variety for you to enjoy.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So I'm going to start off with a question, which was a question that came in on the cash flow episode, which was episode 26.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And so that episode was an introduction to the cash flow statement.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And if you're interested, if you haven't heard that show, it's at radicalpersonalfinance.com/26.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   But I want to answer a question from Big Dave, who commented on that episode.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And here was his comment.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   He said, "I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the following.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I put aside every month a one-twelfth portion of large annual expenses, like auto insurance.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   When I do the math on what my savings rate is for a given month, my savings rate would include this money that I set aside.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Then the month rolls around where that large annual expense is due.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It's great because I have that money and can pay the bill in cash.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   But when I do my savings rate calculation, the month that the large expense came due, couldn't it actually be negative?"
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And he goes on to give an example and says that in month one, example, assume he has $1,000 of gross income, $900 of expenses.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So he has a surplus of $100, and so his savings rate is 10%.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   But technically that $100 is allocated towards the auto insurance payment, which is due 12 months from now.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And then in month 12, he earns $1,000, has $900 of regular expenses, and then has $1,200 of auto insurance costs.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And so it looks like he has a deficit of $1,100 and a messed up savings rate.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So he says, "If I had a statement of cash flows over a one-year period, everything would equal out.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   But looking at some one-month period, it looks bad."
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Now, when I use this question, it's a good question, and I want to use this as an opportunity just to introduce you briefly to two important concepts from accounting.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   So I think in this question, Dave, you made the point at the end that if I do it over a one-year period, everything would equal out.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   But if I look at it in the same one-month period, it looks bad.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And so this is an important concept for us to understand.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Accounting is a science that has been developed to help us understand how the numbers are flowing a little bit better.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And in some ways, it's somewhat arbitrary and it can be manipulated.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   That's why it's important to understand accounting.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Otherwise, you could be manipulated.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   If you were an investor and you were looking at a company and you were trying to analyze what that company were worth,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   you need to understand what the numbers are on the page and what those numbers mean and what they signify.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And this would be the same if you're running your own business or if you're analyzing publicly traded companies
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   or you're looking at a private company that you may invest in.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And so you need to understand the language of accounting.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And unfortunately, in our society, the language of accounting is not commonly taught.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I think personally, if I had my druthers, I would throw out trigonometry in high school and teach accounting instead
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   because it's just far more useful than trigonometry for the majority of people.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I think very few people will solve trigonometry.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I don't remember anything that I studied in trigonometry, but I do remember the things I use accounting for,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   whether it's for personal accounting or not.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So the problem that you've pointed out, Dave, is why something called accrual accounting was developed.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   There are two methods of accounting.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Excuse me, there's actually three, but there's two primary methods of accounting,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and the third one is a hybrid, some hybrid between these two methods of accounting.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   The first method of accounting is what's called a cash method of accounting.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And this is the way that you're currently managing your personal financial accounting.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   This is how most people manage their personal financial accounting for their personal finances.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Some businesses will also use this method of accounting, but the types of businesses are limited under the tax code.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   But in a cash method of accounting, you recognize an expense when you spend the money,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   and you recognize income when you receive the money.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So in the example that you gave me in your question, you are recognizing the expense for auto insurance in month 12,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and you're recognizing the income each month with your $1,000 of income.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Now, that's different from what's called accrual accounting, and in accrual accounting,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   you recognize the expense when it is incurred, regardless of when the cash flows out of your checking account.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And this is very important, and so the example would be if you were running a business.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Let's say that you were -- well, let's use a job.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   It works exactly the same in a job.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   In a job, you provide services every day, and what happens is that let's say that you're paid once a month,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   for the ease of my own personal example.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   If you have a once-a-month paycheck, you provide those services every day,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and then that income accrues, and then at the end of the month, you're provided with a paycheck.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Now, it's not always like that.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   You could be paid every hour.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   You could be paid every day.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   A day laborer would be more likely to be paid every day, but we usually --
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   it's more convenient for us to accrue the earnings and have them paid out under a regular period,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   every two weeks, bimonthly, monthly, whatever the situation is.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But what if you were doing something under a contract relationship?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   So let's say that you provided consulting services,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   and you provided those consulting services in the first month and the second month and then the third month,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and then you went ahead and billed your client in the fourth month,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   and then your client went ahead and paid you in the sixth month.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   So do you recognize the income in the sixth month,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   or do you recognize it in month one, two, and three when you did the work?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Well, under a cash method of accounting, you would recognize it when you actually receive the income.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So you would recognize it in month six.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But under accrual income, you would recognize the income in month one, month two, and month three.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   So in accrual accounting, you would have an account for your auto insurance,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   and if you were keeping financial statements, personal financial statements,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   under a method of accrual accounting, then you would mark in January, or let's just say month one,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   you would mark auto insurance expense $100.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And then in month two, auto insurance expense $200.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And then in month three, auto insurance expense $300.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And then if you performed your savings rate calculation in month one, two, and three,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   it would show a 0% savings rate because you're not actually saving any money.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   You're just accruing the expense, the money for the expense in a separate account,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   and then you'll actually send the money off in month 12.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And that brings us to another accounting concept that has been developed called double-entry accounting.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And I'm trying to use very plain language to explain this so that it's clear.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I went through accounting in college, and I never understood it.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I never got it, even though I went through the accounting classes,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   because no one's took the time to explain it to me clearly and explain why it should matter to me.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   So that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   If any of you are accounting wonks or gurus, please correct me.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Come by the show notes and correct me if I get something wrong.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   But I'm just going to keep plain language and try to ignore some of the oddball examples.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So in double-entry accounting, what you do with a double-entry accounting is that you have a series of accounts.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   So single-entry accounting would be--an example would be your checking account,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   where you have one check register.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   And as the cash goes in and the cash goes out, you're just simply tracking that.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   But in a double-entry system, you would have a series of accounts.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   So picture in your mind, for your auto insurance example, picture in your mind your checking account register,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   and then imagine that you had set up a second checking account register that was marked car insurance or auto insurance.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Well, in month one, then what would happen is you would enter a transaction,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   and you would deduct an amount from the checking account,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   and you would add an amount to the car insurance register for the $100 expense.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And you would accrue the money in the car insurance register each month.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   So for every transaction in a double-entry accounting system,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   you have a transaction on what's called either side of the accounting equation.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   And so let me give you the accounting equation.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   The way that I was taught it is this is the iron law of accounting equation.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Assets equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   So if you're going to deduct an amount from the assets, you have to also deduct an amount from the liabilities.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   If you're going to add an amount to the liabilities, you also have to add an amount to the assets
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   or also to the shareholders' equity side.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   So endeavoring to keep this simple--and by the way, you could--if that doesn't make sense to you,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   sometimes it's easier for people to think about this--equity equals assets minus liabilities.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So that's kind of how we're used to thinking of it because it lines up with net worth equals assets minus liabilities.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   So equity equals assets minus liabilities.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   You can just do an algebraic rearrangement of that formula in any way that you want.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   But the point of this is that you are always keeping multiple accounts.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   So you have in double-entry accounting system, you have various expense accounts.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   You would have an auto insurance expense account.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And then when you made a deduction, when that money was accrued in the auto insurance account,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   and then when you were ready to pay that, then you would go ahead and make a deduction from that account,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   and that money would flow over and would go out in an expense category.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   So the answer to your question is you probably don't need to get that in depth with your personal financial statements.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Most people don't.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   What I would encourage you is, A, if you're going to look at it over an account--
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   if you're going to look at it at your finances over a one-month period,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   you would need to go ahead and establish an accrual account for something like a car insurance expense
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   because you're not saving the money.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And this is one of the things that happens.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And I'll give you--many people automatically assume, "Okay, if I'm saving this money for car insurance,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   I know that that expense is going to come up and they're going to have to write the check."
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   But what many people will do is they'll say, "I'm saving money in a savings account every month,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   so I have--every month I put $500 over into a savings account."
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   But that savings account is actually going to be spent on something like a new couch or a vacation
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   or a nice dinner out or a daughter's birthday party or something like that.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   So although we use the word "savings account," that money is not savings.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It's just simply--what would be a better word?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I'm kind of going over to where this technically isn't correct.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   It is savings.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   It's more like accruals.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   You're accruing money for a vacation fund.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   You're accruing money for a car fund, for a car repair, things like that.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And so it's important that you understand it because unless--the only money that you're actually saving--
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   saving, saving--is money that's not going to be spent.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And you could modify that and say it's not going to be spent forever, which would--you know, most--
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   it doesn't make a lot of sense to not spend money forever to me.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   I'd rather just spend all the money when I'm alive.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   But it's at least going to be over maybe a 20-year period or a 30-year period or a 10-year period
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   or a 5-year period, something like that.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   So I would encourage you do some studying about accrual accounting versus cash method of accounting
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   and do some studying about double-entry bookkeeping versus single-entry bookkeeping.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   What I find is that the cash method of accounting and single-entry bookkeeping is limiting
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   because once you understand the value of double-entry accounting and of accrual accounting,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   once you understand the value of that, it's hard to go back to the more simplified version.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   I find that frustrating.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   One of my personal frustrations--and this is not--I want to be clear.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I would not give this recommendation to the majority of people.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   But I find single-entry accounting methods, which is what basically all personal finance accounting methods are,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   very frustrating.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   So I--for my personal accounts, for example, I use a double-entry accounting software that is--
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I use something called New Cash, G-N-U New Cash,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   which is a double-entry method of accounting that's developed for businesses.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And I just have my accounts in there customized under personal accounts.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   I'm thinking about switching to QuickBooks because of the factor of being the QuickBooks online system,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   but--so that I can have access to their cloud-based services, which New Cash doesn't support.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   But that's far too complicated for most people.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   I remember I used to--years ago I tried using QuickBooks and I couldn't understand how it worked.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Now I understand how it works and I get frustrated with Quicken
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   because I want to establish more accounts and I want to establish better bookkeeping for myself.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   So make it a point of study for yourself.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   That's the technical answer to your question is you are right,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   and that's why you would need to accrue the expense each month.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   That would be the way that you would look at it.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   And what I forgot to say, as I was trying to drive at,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   is that you should probably keep using single-entry accounting just like you're doing now,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   but you should just probably look at it over a one-year period of time.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Or if you pay your auto insurance every six months, just look at it over every six months period of time.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   That gives you enough of a perspective.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I mean, you don't need to produce audited financial statements for your personal finances.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   You're just trying to get a general idea of where you're going.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And frankly, looking back is only useful to give you information about where you're going to go.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   So it's not that big of a deal.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   You don't need an audited financial statement.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   So there is a technical answer, and then there's a practical answer to your question.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Now, this mental model of accounting--I want to make one more comment on it.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   This mental model of accounting, using double-entry accounting
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   and using the idea of different accounts and using the idea of the accounting equation,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   I find this to be very useful in every aspect of life.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   This is not--what I'm about to say is not technically correct.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   I've never heard anyone speak about this.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   I've never read anybody speak about this, but this is something that I think--one way that I think about it.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   I think of the accounting equation, which again, the one that's in my mind is equity equals assets minus liabilities.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I think of this far beyond money because I think it's a powerful way to understand how life works.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Accounting was developed--the science of accounting was developed to try to understand how money works
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and money flows within a business.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   So the development of the income statement, the development of the cash flow statement,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   the development of the retained earnings statement, the development of the balance sheet,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   the four basic financial statements of any business, the development of these statements was--
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   these were developed to explain what's going on inside the business.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   And I like to use this model to understand what's going on in my mind and in my life
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   because I think in life we have an iron accounting statement in many ways.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   We have a certain amount of time and we have a certain amount of energy that is here in our lifetime.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Now again, this model will break down, but let me just tell you how I think about it.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Let's use a very simple example of work versus family time.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   If I am--or let's use finance versus family.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   If I go and I work more hours, I will earn more money,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   but I will also have less of a time with my family--less time with my family or with people who are valuable to me.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   That is a tradeoff.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And so I can't alter the fact that an additional amount of money is going to require a reduction in time.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And so I need to be careful to make sure that I'm balancing the time and the money and the value of them.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I think about how can I accumulate equity in life?
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   How can I accumulate equity in every way?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   So how can I accumulate more love, more family relationships, more joy of life, more experiences, more fun,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   more things that matter, more things that are eternal?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   I think how can I accrue more of this equity into my life?
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Well, I have to do it by investing.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And so what happens is I think the financial method of accounting--like when people talk about this person is successful,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I cringe when I hear people say, "Well, that guy is really successful,"
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   because my question would be on what standard, on what metric?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   I don't have any interest at all in being the richest man in the world.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Now, the richest man in the world might be successful.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   The richest man in my town might be successful.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   But success is measured based upon our own internal values, and to me, money is merely a tool.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   It's a method to achieve freedom.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And the freedom is what I count as success, and there are many ways to do that.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   So the number of zeros on my bank statement is not a major factor in my life
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   because, in my opinion, it all stays behind me when I'm dead.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   But I can develop equity that continues past my lifetime.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Now, some people try to--let me not be pejorative of them.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Some people develop equity through the use of money that does continue past their death.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   So there are a variety of ways to do it, but the point that I'm trying to make is that I think of something like my health.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   That's an account that I need to put money into.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   So if I'm going to spend financially on better quality food for my family,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   that's going to be in the expense, in the financial expense category,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   but that's an investment into my other account in my double-entry accounting,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   internal mental double-entry accounting system.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   That's an investment into my health account, and I'm willing to make that decision if I have that account.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Now, if I don't have a health account, then what happens is that everything is judged on the basis of finance, on money.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   And then in that situation, then why would you ever purchase higher quality food?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Why would you ever purchase--I'll give you an example.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Let's say that I choose to purchase food from a local producer instead of from a large, mainstream, mega producer.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   That aligns well with my values, but I may spend more money to do so.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   But I'm willing to do that if that's an investment into the social equity or into the moral equity account,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   that I think I would rather do business with a local producer and spend more money
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   than to do business with a big producer that I believe is harming the environment,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   and I'm not willing to do that with my values.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   So for each one of us, the accounts that are in our head are going to be very--are going to be different,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   but that's how I think about it.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Maybe at some point--I've thought about doing a show on this.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   I've never heard anybody talk about it, but it's a little hard because you do need some background in accounting
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   to understand the different accounts.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   It's a little hard for me to communicate, but right off the cuff, that's just my answer to your question.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Thank you for the question.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I hope that you're developing your--I hope that in developing your own personal cash flow statements
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   that it's helpful for you.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Again, I feel it's an incredibly powerful place to start and grow from.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   A couple of quick questions that I received in an email.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Moving on, an email from Micah, and Micah wrote me some very complimentary things,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   and thank you to all of you who have written.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   It's taken me some time to respond to everything just with how busy it is,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   but I want to tell you it warms my heart, and the comments that you make on the show,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   and the emails that you send, and the reviews, and those comments,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   that's my compensation for doing the show at this point, and it's really heartwarming.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   It encourages me to keep going, so thank you.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   He asked me a few questions.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I answered these in an email back to him, but I thought they would be good questions to elaborate on the show.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   First question, "I recently saw the technique where you use your Roth IRA as an emergency fund
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   since your contributions can be withdrawn without penalty, but I've not had the time to investigate it further.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Is it a good general strategy, or is it only appropriate in some situations?
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And if you do use it, what type of assets are appropriate to invest in?"
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   So I want to answer this question.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   I mentioned this, I think I mentioned it in passing, but the Roth IRA, I want to elaborate here.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   The Roth IRA is a very useful account.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   So fundamentally, as far as how the Roth IRA works from a tax perspective,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   you can establish a Roth IRA, you use after-tax money to go into the account,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   so you don't get any kind of current tax deduction.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   You fund the account with after-tax dollars.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   You put the money in. The money can grow over time, and you won't pay any tax on the growth of the money.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And when you withdraw the money, you withdraw the money income tax-free.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   There are some other advantages and disadvantages of the account,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   and I have a show planned where I will talk through everything you've never wanted to know about the Roth IRA.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   But that's all we need to cover for today.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Now, the unique part of a Roth IRA, unique to many other retirement accounts,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   is that you can always withdraw your original contribution to the account
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   without paying the IRS penalty for early withdrawals from a retirement account.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Across all retirement accounts, if you withdraw money before the age of 59 1/2,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   you will incur a 10% excise tax, a 10% penalty on your funds.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   That's not an income tax. It's a pure penalty.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   So if you withdraw $10,000, regardless of your income level, you're going to pay a $1,000 penalty.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   With the Roth IRA, you can always withdraw your contribution from the account without paying that penalty.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Now, this is dramatic because, let's say that you put $5,000 in,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   and you need $5,000 in a month, you can take the $5,000 back out.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Now, if the $5,000 bucks--assume you had a good month in your investments,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   and it grew from $5,000 to $5,500, if you tried to withdraw $5,500,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   you would pay the penalty on the $500 of growth.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   So if you withdrew the whole $5,500, you would pay a $50 penalty on the $500 of growth from the account.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   But the key is you can always get out your original contribution without paying penalties.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   So this is useful because if you are not so sure about whether or not you're going to need the money,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   it's nice to know that, "Okay, I can at least always get my contribution out.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   I can't get interest out, but I can get my contribution."
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   So to me, starting from a young age, there is little reason not to use the Roth IRA
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   as a primary account to accumulate some cash in.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   At the beginning of life, it's likely that income is going to be fairly low,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   so we don't need to worry too much about the higher tax deduction that we could get from an IRA versus a Roth IRA.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And if we can always get our contributions out, this can be a very flexible account for us.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Now, there are some problems.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   So number one is it's usually a little bit unwieldy to get money in and out of an account.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Depending on who your custodian is--maybe it's a bank, maybe it's an online brokerage company--
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   you can get money in and out, but it's not quite as easy as just, boom, write money right out of a savings account.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   So I wouldn't start here. I wouldn't accumulate all of my money in a Roth IRA.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   I would start with other savings. I would start with physical cash.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Physical dollar bills are probably going to be more useful.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   I would do that before I would do money in a savings account because it's a good idea.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Number one, you can always get deals to have physical cash.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Number two is then I would start with some money in bank accounts and how much is very situationally dependent.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   For some people, $1,000 in a savings account is a big deal, and they're excited to get to that.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   For some people, $100,000 in a savings account--if they have less than $100,000 in a savings account,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   then they'd be nervous at night. So you've got to figure out what the right amount is.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   But if you were trying to accumulate additional money from there, even just getting started at relatively low dollar figures,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   then I would go ahead and use a Roth IRA. I don't see any reason not to.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   The trick that you would have to avoid is you would have to--if you were using it as a cash reserve,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   like an emergency fund or a cash reserve fund, you would have to avoid investing the money
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   into something that had the possibility of short-term loss of principle.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   So it would be inappropriate--if this were your cash reserve fund, it would be inappropriate to buy stocks
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   because you may, in any random month, have a 20% decline in the market value of your stocks.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Well, if you put $5,000 in and you go and you can only get $4,000 out, that wasn't a good move.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   And if you anticipate needing the money, that wasn't a good move.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   So if you were using this, I would just keep it as a cash investment in the short term.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   And whether that's with a brokerage company and just use one of their cash accounts or money market accounts,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   or whether that were with the bank, you'd have to deal with that with your custodian.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   So I would steer away from using an investment account if you're just getting started and accumulating.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Now, if you've done this for a few years--let's say you put $5,000 in, put $5,000 in, put $5,000 in,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   you've built up other cash, you have other sources, then yes, go ahead and start investing the money.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   And frankly, there's no reason not to if you can get to the money quickly.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   And if your situation looks like this, there's no reason not to keep some portion of that in cash
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   as allocated for your emergency fund.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And then if you need money, cover it with a credit card or something,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   take the distribution from the custodian, from the brokerage account, or however you have it structured,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and move it over into your other accounts.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   So for each person, that answer is going to be different.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And it's going to be different based upon your situation, based upon what you can save,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   based upon what you need the money for.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It's going to be different to say, "How much money am I going to keep in my wallet?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   How much money am I going to keep in a checking account, in a savings account, in a brokerage account?"
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   And those answers are going to be extremely dependent on what your actual situation is.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   So I don't want to go any deeper than that, but the answer is yes, you can do it.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I would be careful if you were using that as a buffer account.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   I would be careful about investing it.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   His question number two, "You mentioned that permaculture has really changed the way you think about other subjects.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Do you have a recommended reading list of permaculture books?"
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   No, I don't.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Where I would start, if you're interested in permaculture, the video that I originally saw
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   that got me completely intrigued is a video on YouTube called "Greening the Desert."
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   I'll make sure to link it in the show notes.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   If you go online, go to YouTube, and search for "Greening the Desert,"
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   that is a project that was designed and implemented by a man named Jeff Lawton.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   He was called in to the Dead Sea Valley in Jordan, and he was given, I think, ten acres to work with
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   of horribly flat, arid, salted land.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   By applying some design techniques, he took the desert and he greened it.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   It's absolutely amazing to see.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   When I saw how quickly he had done that transformation with desert land,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   it shocked me because I had always assumed, "Well, desert, you can't do anything in the desert."
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   That sent me off into a world of research on YouTube.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   That's the best place because you can see some of these transformations on YouTube, and it's very visual.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Once you go through the visual aspects of permaculture,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   and you start to see some of the good design techniques and what can be done,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   then you can move into books.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   There's a bunch of books. I'm not an expert on the academic side of it.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I don't know what's the best, what's not. I've read a bunch of books on it.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Permaculture is basically fairly simple.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   There are three ethics. It's a design science based around three ethics.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Then some--how many design principles are there?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   I'm not even going to mess up the numbers, but there's three ethics and some design principles.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Once you understand them, then it's just basically a working framework
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   towards which you can apply on any landscape.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   It can be applied in many other things.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   The best videos I have seen are done by Jeff Lawton.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Go to his website at jefflawton.com.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   If you put in your name and email address--he has a name and email screen, but it's worth it--
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   then on the right hand side and click enter,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   it'll take you to a bunch of videos that he's done on different aspects of permaculture design.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   His videos are really awesome.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   He uses that as a landing page to sell an occasional course.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   He does a permaculture design course, which is the basis of permaculture education.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   He does that about two to three times a year, but it's really good.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   He's got a lot of really great free emails, which are kind of the teaser to get you involved.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Those are two questions from Micah.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   He asked a third question about doing planning for older people.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   I'm going to skip that for right now.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   I answered him in an email, but let's go on.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Next question.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I had a question from a listener named Nick.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   He said, "Joshua, you have me thinking about starting a business for myself,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   but I'm stuck on what to consider.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   I've tried various online businesses, but I'm not really interested.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   I'm thinking something more local like leasing out porta-potties or construction site dumpsters,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   maybe starting an insurance agency, something like that.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   We make about $300,000, but we want to build something bigger,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   maybe put down a few thousand bucks.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Can you do a show on scalable small business ideas you can start while earning a great living already?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   I work about 20 to 30 hours a week, so I have time.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Please help, especially for those who can fork over some cash to get started. Thanks."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   It's an interesting question, and the reason I bring it up here is because I have a few ideas,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   but frankly I don't know how to answer this question.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   That's what this show is about.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   So I'm going to do a lot of shows over time on great business ideas
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   and try to interview as many entrepreneurs as I can find from different subjects and different backgrounds.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   But I don't have a list of great small businesses that can be started on the side.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   My conviction, my answer to this question, is probably just about any business might be able to be started on the side,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   but you need something more to go on than just, "I want to make money."
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   It seems to me, from everything that I have read and learned from other entrepreneurs,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   it seems to me that you need some reason for doing a business that goes beyond making money.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   It seems to me that running a business and being an entrepreneur purely for the sake of money,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   it's too hard. It's too difficult.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Now, I think there are probably exceptions to that, but if that were the only reason,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   I think it would be too difficult.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   I'm sure there's lots of scalable businesses that could be started on the side,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   but you kind of have a difference there between a little bit of time and a lot of money
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   versus a lot of money and a little bit of time.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   I would start with, what are the other reasons why you would start a business?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   It would seem, and Nick in other comments on his question, he said that they're saving a good amount of money.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   So it would seem to me that if you already have a good income stream established with a minimum amount of time
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   and you're able to save a lot of money, that's a pretty sweet setup.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   So then the question would be, well, what kind of business would you actually want to start?
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Are you starting a business for joy, for impact?
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   I think you've got to give some thought to what are your natural inclinations.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   It seems to me that most people should be drawn to something.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   It's always been hard for me to answer career questions because I'm a little bit flummoxed
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   when someone says, "What career do you think is a good career?"
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   I've got a list of a hundred ideas, and I constantly am thinking, "Hey, this would be interesting.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   That would be fun. That would be a cool adventure. What if I did this? What if I did that?
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   What if I did the other thing?"
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   I think one of the big steps that you could start, Nick, is just start by being aware of what you're interested in.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   So keep a list. If you don't already have one, keep a list of anything you think would be cool.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   This show came out of that list.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   I've always loved listening to people that were--I've always loved listening to radio.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I've always loved listening to speeches, and I thought, "There's a place for this, but how could I do it?"
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It integrates what I'm naturally gifted with, what I love to do, and what I love to consume,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   and it integrates with my knowledge base.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   So make a list of ideas, and then start to research that list and see what clicks for you.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   To this day, I have a file of ideas that, to me, I think there's at least 150 different ideas for jobs or businesses
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   that I think would be fun, and they range all across the board.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   They range from as simple as the fact that I've always thought it would be fun to be a barista at Starbucks.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   I like coffee. I love the coffeehouse atmosphere. I always thought that would be really fun.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Or Panera Bread. I always thought that would be really fun. I like the atmosphere.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   All the way to I've thought of building a real estate investment empire.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   I've thought about opening a school.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I have some ideas for a more effective way to do school that I think would be better for students,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   better for teachers, and better for parents, and in a for-profit way.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   I've got some ideas about that.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   I've thought about opening a grass-fed cattle operation. I live in Florida.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   I'm really interested in agriculture, as you can tell by some of the guests that I've brought on.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   I've thought about doing an international tour guide company.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   I like to travel. I love to help people experience things, and there's a lot of people that can benefit from that.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   I've got a list. I've thought about working in a hotel.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   I think that it would be fun to work in the hotel industry.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   I've always been interested by that.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   I've thought about building out franchises.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   To me, every one of these things has good things and bad things about it.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   This show is just simply the thing that made the most sense on that list based upon things that I would like to do.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   But there are many other things on that list.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   I would encourage you to spend a lot of time getting to know yourself.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Maybe you already do this, but to me, to ask a question in a general wayâ€”and I appreciate the question.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   It's good to ask a question. I'm not insulting the question.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   But to ask the question in a general way would imply that you don't exactly know what you want to do.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Leasing out porta-potties or construction site dumpsters.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Maybe that's a good, lucrative little business. I don't know.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   But again, I'm always a little bit bum-fuzzled by how people don't know what they want to do.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   So I would say start with just spending a lot of time thinking, "What do you want to do?"
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   I personallyâ€”and again, I have not made millions in a large business that I've sold for $20 million.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   But I personally am turned off from the idea of, "What can I do that's going to make the most money?"
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   And I'm turned on by the idea of, "How can I design my ideal lifestyle?"
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   I think of two different kinds of businesses.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And these are not mutually exclusive. I recognize the problems with this thinking.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   I'm just telling you how it works in my head.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   I think of lifestyle businesses and ego businesses.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   To me, a lifestyle business is a lot easier to create than anything else.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   And a lifestyle business is just simply, "How can I do something that perfectly integrates all of my own skills
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   and abilities with something that the market needs, wants, and values?"
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   And an ego business is, "How can I build a great big business, put my name on the side,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   and sell for a lot of money so everyone will be impressed with me?"
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   I don't care to invest the 30 years that I would need to invest into building an ego business.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   I would rather spend that 30 years doing something else.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   So I'm very much attracted to lifestyle businesses.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   But there are a lot of people who go exactly the opposite.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   They just love the thrill of the ego business.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   And again, that's not a pejorative statement to say ego business.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   That's just how I think about it in my mind.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   So I would say spend a lot of time with a journal.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   What do you want to do? What makes you tick?
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   And a lot of times, making a list and say, "What are 30 business ideas that I think are interesting?
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   What are 30 different industries that I'm attracted to?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   What are 30 jobs that I would like to do?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   What are 30 ways that I could make a million bucks?"
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   I remember, I've read various stories.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   What was the example? I read a story recently.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   And the guy said, "I need to make $100,000."
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   And he was trying to--because he wanted to do something else--and he was trying to brainstorm that.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   And so he said, "How can I do it?"
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   And he said, "Well, if I can write a book and I can sell 100,000 copies of it, then I can make my $100,000."
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Maybe this was--you know what?
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   I think I'm thinking of the example of the lady who--or the lady or guy--
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   who did Buns of Steel or Buns of Steel, something like that, workout videos, and a book.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Oh, that's what it was. It was a book.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   It was a lady that wanted to make--I'm going to pause for a second.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   I'm going to go find the book I was reading. Just a moment.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Okay, found it.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   It was--I read this, I don't know, a couple months ago, a month or two ago. I can't remember.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   I was reading Jack Canfield's book, The Success Principles,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   which, by the way, if you want one book that is the best place to start
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   if you're interested in personal development literature, of all the books I've ever read,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   The Success Principles is probably in the top five as far as personal development literature.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   But it's a story in his chapter, and it's called Ask for What You Want,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   and it's used--no, excuse me, it's used feedback to your advantage.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   And it's one short story here, and there's a lady, not a guy.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   One of the best-selling weight loss books ever published was the book Thin Thighs in 30 Days.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   What's so interesting about it, though, is that it was developed solely using feedback.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   The author, Wendy Stelling, worked in an advertising agency but hated her job.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   She wanted to start her own agency but didn't have the money to do so.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   She knew she would need about $100,000, so she began asking,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   "What's the quickest way to raise $100,000?"
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   "Sell a book," said the feedback.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   She decided if she wrote a book that could sell 100,000 copies in 90 days,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   and she made $1 per book, she would raise the $100,000 she needed.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   But what kind of book would 100,000 people want?
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   "Well, what are the best-selling books in America?" she asked.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   "Weight loss books," said the feedback.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   "Yes, but how would I distinguish myself as an expert?" she asked.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   "Ask other women," said the feedback.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   So she went out to the marketplace and asked,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   "If you could lose weight in only one part of your body, what part would you choose?"
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   The overwhelming response from women was, "My thighs."
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   "When would you want to lose it?" she asked.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   "Around April or May, in time for swimsuit season," said the feedback.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   So what did she do?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   She wrote a book called Thin Thighs in 30 Days and released it April 15.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   By June, she had her $100,000, all because she asked people what they wanted
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   and responded to the feedback by giving it to them.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   So I got a little distracted in the time it took me to go get the book.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   But the point was, I think the point I was trying to make is that there's got to be something.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   There are a lot of things that can be done, but there's got to be some reason for it.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   So starting a business, you need to have some specific reason.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   If you want to make more money, why do you want to make more money?
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   And I think that this is where it's much more of a self, like get-to-know-yourself issue
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   than it is "Here's the greatest business idea."
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   There are lots of things you can do for money, but I think consider what you--
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   consider what you--or what your natural inclinations are.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   I think you've got to be drawn to something for some reason.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   And it may be you want to own a McDonald's franchise because you believe in developing people.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   And you can start with entry-level fast food workers,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   and you can teach them how to develop themselves in the McDonald's system.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   I've worked with a number of clients who, within McDonald's,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   started as front-line minimum-level workers and make six-figure incomes plus now.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Do you want to run hotels because you like working with travelers?
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Do you want to invest in horse farms? I don't know.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Do you want to promote something that you're committed to?
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   For example, I would be inclined to go work in agriculture
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   because I want to promote those things that I think are important as far as agriculture
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   and the types of values and the types of approaches that make sense to me.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Where do you see opportunity?
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Looking for opportunity and trying to find it.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   That's what I'm doing with this podcast is I see opportunity.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   I see a burgeoning market.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   I see a number of market conditions that are going to be changing substantially
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   within the next 12 to 24 months, and that this opportunity is increasing largely.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   So that's what I'm trying to focus on.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   What are the risks that you personally have that you're concerned about?
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Can you leverage your current career?
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Is there something--if you are in an area of expertise,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   can you leverage that career into making more money?
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   The example of writing a book.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   If you're in a career where you can just take your knowledge and write a book,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   can you use that to make the million bucks that you need on top of the salary
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   that you have right now?
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   I would look for what are you interested in investing in?
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Do you want to be a venture capital investor?
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Do you want to be a trader?
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Do you want to do local real estate deals?
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Are you looking for passive income or active income?
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   For example, if you've got money, you can invest that completely passively,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   buy securities, publicly traded companies, sit back and collect that money.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   You don't need to do a thing for it.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Now, on the other hand, you can go very active, and you can go work in--
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   venture as a--if you've got cash, you can go and build out a real estate portfolio
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   and be very hands-on, flipping properties.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   That's a good place if you've got cash, and if you're drawn to that,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   it's very active, but you can make an excellent rate of return
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   if you're skillful at that.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   What I would do is I would personally just simply focus on taking some money
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   and investing it, and frankly, taking people to lunch
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   and building out things and talking to people.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   For example, make it a target to take two business people in your town
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   out to lunch, two independent entrepreneurs, whether you rate them in the newspaper
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   or something, and take them out to lunch and find out--learn from their success
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   and find out what opportunities they see locally.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   If you mention that you have capital to invest,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   you will have plenty of people pursue you.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   That's an example of--I don't know how to answer the question exactly,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   but that's how I would think it through.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   Then the last plea I would say for the audience,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   if you know of guests that would fill this listener's question,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   that would be a good point.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   Again, doing a show on scalable small business ideas
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   that you can start while earning a great living,

[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   and let me know what those things would be.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Let me know who you think would be good, and send them a note,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   and I'd love to have them on the show and interview them.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   That would be awesome.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   Next question.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   I want to get into a little bit of the feedback that I got on the Walmart show.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Overall, the feedback has been really great.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   That show has been well received.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   But I did receive two comments on the show that I would like to address,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   and I think this will be useful to talk through.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   The first comment was a comment about--
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   was what I said accurate about the reasons for success at Walmart,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   a fairly lengthy comment. I'm going to read that one.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   The second comment was directed towards my mentioning of dress code
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   in a comment I made that is perceived as racist.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   So I'm going to address both of these,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   and I've got some thoughts that I want to use as a good example.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Some thoughts I want to share with you on these comments.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   So I'm going to begin with a--I'm going to begin with--
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   I'm going to begin with the comment here from John,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   which is a very thoughtful comment, and I replied to it,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   but with my issues with the commenting system,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   for some reason my replies don't seem to be showing up.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   But I did want to honor the comment.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   It's a very thoughtful and very lengthy comment,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   and so I'm going to read it.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   He said, "When you state, 'There's a reason minimum wage is what it is,'
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   it sounds like you're implying that the worker just doesn't bring that much value,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   so the wage is naturally low.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   I think it has more to do with the weak bargaining position the worker has.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Think of it this way.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Walmart doesn't hire anyone unless the value they bring exceeds the cost of employing them.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   That's how capitalism works.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Hire someone that brings value X, compensate them at a rate of X minus Y,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   and the difference Y is profit.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Walmart is very profitable,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   so they are obviously hiring people for much less than the value they produce.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   That's how you make a profit."
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Pause for a second.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   If you haven't listened to the Walmart show,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   you may want to go back and listen to the Walmart show.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   It was entitled, "My Plan for How I Would Become a Millionaire
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   with a Minimum Wage Job at Walmart."
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   It was episode 43.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   It can be found at radicalpersonalfinance.com/43.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   The last two questions of the show are about that,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   so it will make more sense to you if you haven't heard that show
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   to go and listen to that.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   How is Walmart able to do this, making such a large profit?
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   "They are effective at preventing unionization.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   If people are organized and speak with one voice,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   they have a stronger bargaining position,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   and they naturally get better compensation.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   They take a larger share of the value they produce.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   This is why we have a middle class in the U.S.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Unions did exactly this and produced a middle class with purchasing power.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   That purchasing power fueled further consumption and stronger economic growth."
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   "The other thing Walmart does to reduce compensation is destroy local industry.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   You say that nobody chooses to work at Walmart.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   You are free to leave.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   But because the local hardware store and local grocer is now out of business,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   some people find themselves with fewer options.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   If you are free to choose, but one alternative brings a lot of suffering,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   no weekly paycheck means hunger pains,
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   is staying really a free choice?"
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   So his point, "If you're free to choose,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   but one alternative brings a lot of suffering,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   is staying really a free choice?"
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   "Walmart management exploits this reality to squeeze further concessions from employees,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   driving profits further higher."
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   "You say the CEO of Walmart makes what he does because of the value he brings.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   This once again ignores the bargaining position he is in with regards to his compensation.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   The board of directors of various companies typically follow a sort of incestuous pattern.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   They each serve on one another's board and ensure good compensation.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   It's not necessarily that they are bringing real value in terms of improving the world
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   or providing a better quality product at a better price.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   In fact, often they cause a lot of harm.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   They can make choices that harm the long-term success of the company.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   This is a very typical phenomenon.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Stockholders don't typically care about the long-term success of a company.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   If they can extract the value quickly and move on,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   then they can generate high returns on investment."
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   "I thought your overall plan was good,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   but I believe you have come to accept a lot of assumptions
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   that reflect beliefs preferred by the rich that are false.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   These are beliefs rich often use to justify in their own mind their riches."
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   So I thought this was a thoughtful comment,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   and John, I appreciate you making the comment.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   And I'm going to respond to some of your points
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   and just give you the audio version of what I responded,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   and use it as a good example for us to go and to go into to research things.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Now, you could be right in all of your claims,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   and I could be completely wrong, or I could be wrong and you could be right.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Chances are probably it's somewhere in the middle.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   I'm probably wrong about some things,
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   and you're probably wrong about some things.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   We're both probably equally right about some things.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   But I'm just going to go through and just respond
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   because I do want to thank you for the good comment.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   First of all, when you state there's a reason minimum wage is what it is,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   it sounds like you're implying that the worker just doesn't bring that much value
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   so the wage is naturally low.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   I'm not only implying that, I'm saying that specifically.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   A minimum wage worker does not bring a lot of value.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   They're easily replaced, and that's why the wage is low.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   And so the key to escaping poverty is increasing the value
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   so that you can earn higher wages.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   So I'm not only implying it, I'm specifically saying it.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   The key to escaping poverty is increasing the value delivered.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Let's use a generic example.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   You can destroy this as a generic example.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   Let's use a generic example.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Let's say that I hire somebody to sweep the floor.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   If all that's required for sweeping the floor
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   is for me to give somebody a broom and say, "Sweep the floor,"
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   and they know how to do that, and I can train them how to do that in about five minutes,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   it is impossible to command a very high wage for that.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   I think about this when I see sign spinners on the street.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   That's all the rage down here.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   I think it probably is where most people--
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   how much do you have to pay somebody to stand on the street
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   with an iPod, earphones in their ears so they have something to listen to
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   or a book to read, and hold a sign on the street corner about minimum wage?
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   And the reason you can pay them about minimum wage
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   is because there's no value that they can't replace one with another.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   If I'm hiring a sign spinner, it doesn't matter to me what color you are,
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   how big you are, how not big you are.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   All I need is someone at 8 a.m. to go out and sit on the side of the street with a sign.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   That's the whole point.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   Now, how can the sign spinner command a higher wage?
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   I don't remember exactly where, but I read an article a few years ago,
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   and it was talking about this guy who had built a sign-spinning company.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   But what he did was he built a company that trained people
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   on how to spin signs for greater effect.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   So the entire reason that a business owner is hiring somebody
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   to hold a sign on the side of the road is to get people to see that sign
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   and to draw attention so that they know his business exists,
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   so that they can come in, darken his door, and buy his products.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   This guy built, first of all, his own income source
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   based upon being a sign spinner, throwing the sign up, spinning it around,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   doing it in a way that attracted a lot more attention,
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   and he was able to command a higher wage from the business owners that hired him
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   because of his extra antics that drew more attention.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   He went on and built it into a business where he was training other people
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   on how to spin signs.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   And that's an ideal example of, yes, the minimum wage worker
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   does not bring much value, and my proof for that is because the wage is low.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   The guy who was having sign spinners that worked, that stood there
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   and spun the sign and danced and did all these extra things to bring attention,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   he was charging higher prices for his sign spinning
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   than was the other person that spun the sign.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   Demanding that a business owner pays you more
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   when you are in a weak position of not bringing up much value
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   is a path to poverty.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   If all I do is stand there with an iPod in my ears--
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   and that's what I would do.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   I would sit there and listen to my podcast every day and learn how to get rich.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   But if all I did was stand there with an iPod in my ear
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   and demand a higher wage, guess what?
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   I'm going to be fired, and the guy is going to replace me the next day
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   with someone else who wants it.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   Now, if I work and I develop my value,
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   and while I'm listening to my podcast all day long,
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   I'm working on how can I design some technique of dancing
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   and looking like a fool or wearing a costume or spinning the sign
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   so that I'm helping the business owner in that direction,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   then that would actually drive business,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   and now I'm actually far more valuable.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   I'm not as easily replaced.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   Now, you're right.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   Walmart doesn't hire anyone unless the value they bring
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   exceeds the cost of employing them.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   That's how capitalism works.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   Hire someone that brings value X, compensate them a rate of X minus Y,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   and the difference Y is profit.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Walmart is very profitable,
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   so they're obviously hiring people for much less than the value they produce.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   That's how you make a profit.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   That's your comment.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   That's exactly right.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   So the point is that if somebody brought a higher value,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   then they could pay a higher wage.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   Now, I'll go on and read because I want to fairly represent your argument.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   How is Walmart able to do this?
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   They are effective at preventing unionization.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   If people are organized and speak with one voice,
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   they have a stronger bargaining position,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   and they naturally get better compensation.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   They take a larger share of the value they produce.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   This is why we have a middle class in the U.S.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   Unions did exactly this and produced a middle class with purchasing power.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   That purchasing power fueled further consumption and stronger economic growth.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Now, I actually would like to study more of union history,
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   and if I can make the time to carve out,
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   I would love to study this.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   If you've studied this and you have some books that you would recommend on it, great.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   I personally struggle with what I was taught about unionization,
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   so that's my caveat to say that I could be completely wrong on this,
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   but I'm not quite sure.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   So, A, I disagree with your point that says that the middle class--
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   so this is why we have a middle class in the U.S.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   because unions did this and produced a middle class with purchasing power.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   That does not jive with my understanding of the economic history of this country.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   I would say that the time at which the middle class was destroyed
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   was at the time of mass unionization in industrial America.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   Prior to that point in time, everybody was farmers.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   The vision of the founders of this company was to have a society that was built up of independent people.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   I'll give you two pieces of proof for this.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   Go back and study what the early founding fathers did
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   and who they came from as a class,
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   and go and look at what Abraham Lincoln said about Google mudsill theory.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   Let me pause and let me find his quote. Just a moment.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Okay, I'm going to read--at the risk of losing listeners to my reading--
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   what's going to be challenging to listen to,
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   just due to the fact that we have a difficult time with language that--
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   with intricate language because we're so--we struggle with English language.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   I'm going to read the last third of a speech of Abraham Lincoln,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   and this speech was delivered September 30, 1859,
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   an address by Abraham Lincoln before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   I'm going to use this as proof of my point.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   I'm going to read through this.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   Try to stay listened. I'm going to read it somewhat slowly because the language is complex.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   By the way, if you think that we're getting smarter and smarter as a society,
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   consider that this was common--compare this speech and what he was actually saying
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   with the speech of any presidential address that you've heard from any recent politician.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   I'm only going to read the last about third of it.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   It's about seven paragraphs--no, about nine, excuse me.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   "The world has agreed that labor is the source from which human wants are mainly supplied.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   There is no dispute upon this point.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   From this point, however, men immediately diverge.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   Much disputation is maintained as to the best way of applying and controlling the labor element.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   By some, it is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital,
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   that nobody labors unless somebody else owning capital somehow, by the use of it, induces him to do it.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   Having assumed this, they proceed to consider whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   and thus induce them to work by their own consent or by them--slavery--
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   and drive them to it without their consent.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Having proceeded so far, they naturally conclude that all laborers are necessarily either hired laborers or slaves.
[00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   They further assume that whoever is once a hired laborer is fatally fixed in that condition for life
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   and thence again that his condition is as bad as or worse than that of a slave.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   This is the mudsill theory.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   But another class of reasoners hold the opinion that there is no such relation between capital and labor, as assumed,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   and that there is no such thing as a free man being fatally fixed for life on the condition of a hired laborer,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   that both these assumptions are false and all inferences from them groundless.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   They hold that labor is prior to and independent of capital,
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   and that, in fact, capital is the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed,
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   that labor can exist without capital, but that capital could never have existed without labor.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Hence they hold that labor is the superior, greatly the superior, of capital.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   They do not deny that there is and probably always will be a relation between labor and capital.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   The error, as they hold, is in assuming that the whole labor of the world exists within that relation.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for them.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   A large majority belong to neither class, neither work for others nor have others working for them.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   Even in all our slave states, except South Carolina, a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   In these free states, a large majority are neither hirers or hired.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   Men with their families, wives, sons, and daughters work for themselves on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops,
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   taking the whole product to themselves and asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hirelings or slaves on the other.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital,
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   that is, labor with their own hands and also buy slaves or hire free men to labor for them.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   But this is only a mixed and not a distinct class.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   Again, as has already been said, the opponents of the "mud-sill theory" insist that there is not, of necessity,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   There is demonstration for saying this.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   Many independent men in this assembly, doubtless a few years ago, were hired laborers,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   and their case is almost, if not quite, the general rule.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages a while.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   Saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   Then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   I'm going to read that sentence again because to me that's the crux of my point.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   This is the American dream.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages a while.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   Saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   Then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   This, say its advocates, is free labor.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   The just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way for all,
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   gives hope to all, and energy and progress and improvement of condition to all.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   If any continue through life in the condition of the hired laborer, it is not the fault of the system,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   but because of either a dependent nature which prefers it, or improvidence, folly, or singular misfortune.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   I have said this much about the elements of labor generally,
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   as introductory to the consideration of a new phase which that element is in process of assuming.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   The old general rule was that educated people did not perform manual labor.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   They managed to eat their bread, leaving the toil of producing it to the uneducated.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   This was not an insupportable evil to the working bees, so long as the class of drones remained very small.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   But now, especially in these free states, nearly all are educated,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   quite too nearly all, to leave the labor of the uneducated, in any wise adequate to the support of the whole.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   It follows from this that henceforth educated people must labor.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   Otherwise, education itself would become a positive and intolerable evil.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   No country can sustain in idleness more than a small percentage of its numbers.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   The great majority must labor at something productive.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   From these premises the problem springs.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   How can labor and education be the most satisfactorily combined?
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   By the mud-silt theory, it is assumed that labor and education are incompatible,
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   and any practical combination of them impossible.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   According to that theory, a blind horse upon a treadmill is a perfect illustration of what a laborer should be.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   All the better for being blind, that he could not kick understandingly.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   According to that theory, the education of laborers is not only useless, but pernicious and dangerous.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   In fact, it is, in some sort, deemed a misfortune that laborers should have heads at all.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Those same heads are regarded as explosive materials, only to be safely kept in damp places,
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   as far as possible from that peculiar sort of fire which ignites them.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   A Yankee who could invent strong-handed man without a head would receive the everlasting gratitude of the mud-silt advocates.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   But free labor says no.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   Free labor argues that, as the author of man makes every individual with one head and one pair of hands,
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   it was probably intended that heads and hands should cooperate as friends,
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   and that that particular head should direct and control that particular pair of hands.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   As each man has one mouth to be fed and one pair of hands to furnish food,
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   it was probably intended that that particular pair of hands should feed that particular mouth,
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   that each head is the natural guardian, director, and protector of the hands and mouth inseparably connected with it,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   and that, being so, every head should be cultivated and improved by whatever will add to its capacity for performing its charge.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   In one word, free labor insists on universal education.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   I have so far stated the opposite theories of mud-silt and free labor without declaring any preference of my own between them.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   On an occasion like this, I ought not to declare any.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   I suppose, however, I shall not be mistaken in assuming as a fact that the people of Wisconsin prefer free labor with its natural companion, education.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   This leads to the further reflection that no other human occupation opens so wide a field
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   for the profitable and agreeable combination of labor with cultivated thought as agriculture.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   I know nothing so pleasant to the mind as the discovery of anything which is at once new and valuable,
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   nothing that so lightens and sweetens toil as the hopeful pursuit of such discovery.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   And how vast and how varied a field is agriculture for such discovery!
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   The mind, already trained to the thought, in the country school or higher school,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   cannot fail to find there an exhaustless source of enjoyment.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Every blade of grass is a study, and to produce two where there was but one is both a profit and a pleasure.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   And not grass alone, but soils, seeds, and seasons, hedges, ditches, and fences,
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   draining, droughts, and irrigation, plowing, hoeing, and harrowing, reaping, mowing, and threshing,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   saving crops, pests of crops, diseases of crops, and what will prevent or cure them,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   implements, utensils and machines, their relative merits, and to improve them,
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   hogs, horses, and cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, trees, shrubs, fruits, plants, and flowers,
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   the thousand things of which these are specimens, each a world of study within itself.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   In all this, book learning is available.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   A capacity and taste for reading gives access to whatever has already been discovered by others.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   It is the key, or one of the keys, to the already solved problems.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   And not only so, it gives a relish and facility for successfully pursuing the unsolved ones.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   The rudiments of science are available and highly valuable.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   Some knowledge of botany insists in dealing with the vegetable world with all growing crops.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   Chemistry assists in the analysis of soils, selection, and application of manures, and in numerous other ways.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   The mechanical branches of natural philosophy already help in almost everything,
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   but especially in reference to implements and machinery.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   The thought recurs that education, cultivated thought, can best be combined with agricultural labor,
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   or any labor, on the principle of thorough work.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   That careless, half-performed, slovenly work makes no place for such combination.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   And thorough work, again, renders sufficient the smallest quantity of ground to each man.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   And this again conforms to what must occur in a world less inclined to wars,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   and more devoted to the arts of peace than heretofore.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   Population must increase rapidly, more rapidly than in former times,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   and ere long the most valuable of all arts will be the art of deriving a comfortable subsistence from the smallest area of soil.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   No community whose every member possesses this art can ever be the victim of oppression of any of its forms.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   Such community will be alike independent of crowned kings, money kings, and land kings.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   But, according to your program, the awarding of premiums awaits the closing of this address.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   Consider the deep interest necessarily pertaining to that performance.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   It would be no wonder if I am already heard with some impatience.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   I will detain you, but a moment longer.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   Some of you will be successful, and such will need but little philosophy to take them home in cheerful spirits.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   Others will be disappointed, and will be in a less happy mood.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   To such, let it be said, lay it not too much to heart.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   Let them adopt the maxim, "Better luck next time," and then, by renewed exertion, make that better luck for themselves.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   And by the successful and unsuccessful, let it be remembered that, while all occasions like the present bring their sober and durable benefits,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   the exultations and mortifications of them are but temporary,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   that the victor shall soon be the vanquished if he relax in his exertion,
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   and that the vanquished this year may be victor the next, in spite of all competition.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence, to be ever in view,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   They presented him the words, "And this too shall pass away."
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   How consoling in the depths of affliction! "And this too shall pass away."
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   And yet, let us hope, it is not quite true.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   Let us hope, rather, that by the best cultivation of the physical world beneath and around us,
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   and the intellectual and moral world within us,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   we shall secure an individual, social, and political prosperity and happiness,
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   whose course shall be onward and upward, and which, while the earth endures, shall not pass away.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   [laughs]
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   That was only the second half of the speech, and hopefully I did that justice.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   It's a little bit humbling to try to read the words of Abraham Lincoln in a way that would be appropriate,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   and yet inspire a little bit of thought.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   And it makes me feel rather ineloquent when I come to try to figure out how to talk when I read.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   Speech is as eloquent as that.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   But the point that I was drawing from it, and the major point,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   is that this is what the United States...
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   This is why the United States was so powerful in the past.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   It was built upon production, and upon the fact that the American dream was not to go get a job
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   and buy a house with a white picket fence.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   The American dream was that sentence I emphasized.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   I'll find it again here.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   "The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages a while,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself,
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   then labors on his own account another while,
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   and at length hires another new beginner to help him."
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   That was the American dream.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   That was why people were prosperous.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   Now, I think there were legitimate problems that were solved.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   I think there were legitimate abuses by the "robber barons," so-called.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   It's on my reading list.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   I'm reading a...I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through it.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   I need more time to read.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   But right now I have a biography of John D. Rockefeller that I'm looking through,
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   and it's a thick one and a good one.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   But the point is that there's a lot that I don't understand about that period of history.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   And maybe unions in that day and age did solve a lot of problems for people.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   But it was the shift from that egalitarian agricultural society
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   to the industrialized society that allowed people to be exploited.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   Now, were people exploited? Absolutely.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   But just going based upon your comments,
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   unions did not produce a middle class with purchasing power.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   They may have helped--maybe they helped people to recover something of that,
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   but they didn't produce it.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   You can't get rich by demanding.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   If I were running a company and I had people try to unionize--
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   I mean, I'm from Florida.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   I don't understand.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   Some of you guys are from the states and the countries where unions are a big thing.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   I can't imagine myself not firing anybody who tried to unionize
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   just because you're trying to take control away from my business.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   But I don't understand how some of these publicly traded companies,
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   what they have to deal with and the labor issues and all of that.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   It doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   So I don't want to pollute the words of Abraham Lincoln
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   except just simply to point out that that was the American dream,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   was that through education, you worked for somebody else for a while
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   to save a stake, to build a stake that you could then use to buy tools and land.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   Now today I think that's exactly as applicable as it was back then,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   except tools and land are different.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   There is--back to my interview with Curtis Stone--
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   there's an opportunity for people to make an amazing living in agriculture today.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   There are people all over the world doing it.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   But yet maybe that's not what you mean by tools and land.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   Maybe there's something else.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   But that's what I'm trying to promote.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   A couple of other things on your comments here.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   The other thing Walmart does to reduce compensation is destroy local industry.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   You say that nobody--that comment--Walmart has not destroyed local industry.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   Walmart has competed with local industry.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   Sam Walton was local industry.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   He ran five and dime stores.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   Go back and read the history.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   And he had the idea that, hey, if I could lower my prices
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   and sell more money and sell more prices at a lower profit margin,
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   I would make more absolute profit.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   That's what his idea was.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   He had no cost advantages.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   He had only a little bit of money, and he had no special relationships with anybody.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   He was the little dog.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   Kmart and Sears were much bigger than his was.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   He had an idea.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   He had a business model.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   And he went out and he focused on serving underserved and non-served rural towns
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   that the Kmart and the Sears didn't want to do.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   So he went and competed.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   Competition is how all of us survive.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   Walmart didn't destroy local industry.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   It brought a new model and competed, and the local industry failed.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   And that was unquestionably--it was difficult for the local merchants.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   But on the whole, it clearly shows the value is there.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   It is a lot easier today to get in a rural area
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   to get more goods for cheaper than it ever was in the past.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   Not a huge fan of Walmart.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   Again, like I said in another show, I don't enjoy shopping there.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   I think they've done some stuff I'm not happy with.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   That's what happens, but I think those allegations are unfair.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   You say no one chooses to work at Walmart.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   You're free to leave.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   But because the local hardware store and local grocer is out of business,
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   some people find themselves with fewer options.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   If you are free to choose, but one alternative brings a lot of suffering,
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   is staying really a free choice?
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   Yes.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   That was the whole point of the Matt Walsh essay.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   Yes.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   Guess what?
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   You can still go.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   You say Walmart management exploits this reality
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   to squeeze further concessions from employees,
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   driving profits further higher?
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   Prove it to me.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   Give me some proof.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   I guarantee you that somebody could start off at minimum wage with Walmart
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   and make $100,000 as a store manager in less than 5 years
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   if they applied themselves using the plan that I sketched out.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   There's not a doubt in my mind that it could be done.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   All right, there's a doubt in my mind that it could be done in 5 years.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   10 years, go from minimum wage to $100,000.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   Show me the exploitation.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   I'm going to skip the stockholder stuff.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   I think it's just one point, and I want to go on
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   because I want to address the other show.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   By the way, John, I know I'm using this as an example.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   It's probably going to feel like a personal attack on you.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   I appreciate the comment.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   I think that we need to be able to debate this stuff,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   and you can judge whether or not I make any sense or not,
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   and it's fine either way.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   If I don't make any sense, I've got to learn,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   and I'll learn just by people saying, "That doesn't make any sense."
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   But if I do, then we need to be able to debate this stuff in our society.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   We've lost the ability to intelligently debate without getting upset at each other.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   I just want to make one point.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   Stockholders don't typically care about the long-term success of a company.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   The Walton Foundation is controlled by Walton's kids.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   They own almost 50% of the stock.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   That means that more than anything else, the Walton Family Enterprise--
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   it's not the Walton Foundation.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   What was it called? Their business name, I can't remember.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   I think it was the--it was like the Walton Enterprises Holding Company,
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   I think is what it's called, the Walton Enterprises LLC.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   Yeah, Walton Enterprises LLC.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   They own a lot, almost 50% of the firm.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   In the past few years, Walmart has been buying back stocks,
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   substantial amounts of stock.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   So their industry, their stake has grown
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   as the stock buybacks have occurred over the last few years.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   Are you telling me that the Walton kids who control the majority of--
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   almost the majority of Walmart shares don't care about the long-term success
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   of a company?
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   That they're just interested in extracting the value quickly and moving on
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   that can generate high returns on investment?
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   Now, undoubtedly, there are many people trading the stock
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   that are just simply saying, "Hey, I'm going to profit on the move."
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   You've got everything in the market.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   You've got everything from flash traders owning the stock for a few microseconds.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   You've got day traders. You've got swing traders.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   You've got fade traders. You've got long-term investors.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   And you've got the Walton enterprises.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   But I agree that--and this is where these conversations are nuanced.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   I agree with you that it seems to me, like many times,
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   Fortune 500 CEOs and Fortune 500 boards of directors
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   are often short-sighted because of the short-term focus.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   But I don't for an instant believe that that's the case
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   when you have the Walton family controlling almost 50%.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   So hopefully that was a good feedback.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   I spent a long time--I didn't plan to read Lincoln's speech,
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   but it's linked in the show notes. It's worth reading the whole thing.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   I find it inspiring to read some of the stuff from back then
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   and just to see how different it was from today.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   If you ever want to have a question about--
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   Remember, Lincoln was making a speech at an agricultural fair in Wisconsin.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   An agricultural fair. It was the farmers.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   Can you imagine today--that was the average person at that time.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   Can you imagine today the average person sitting down and saying--
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   sitting down and listening to a speech that's that involved?
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   I guarantee I lost probably 20% of you guys.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   You're like, "I can't take this audio."
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   If you've made it to this point, you made it through that speech.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   But that was the average at that point in time.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   I want to address one other comment that somebody made on that show.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   The name here is Mindful Riot.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   And this person's comment was, "Hey, could you just not say things like,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   'Let's leave Civil War history behind and dress for success.'
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   I want to be able to recommend your podcast to people
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   because I think you have a lot of good things to say about personal finance.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   But I'm not sure I can do that when you casually drop racist ideas like that one.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   You do realize you are incredibly privileged as a white man, right?
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   I actually agreed with much of that episode,
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   but that one comment has me thinking about unsubscribing.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.000]   Blacks don't have a hard time today because they are choosing to hold on to the Civil War."
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   That was the comment.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   I went back and I didn't remember making the comment about leaving the Civil War behind.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   And I asked this commenter, I said, "Did I say anything about race?"
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   And I knew what I had said.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   And I went back and listened to it.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   And I found out I did say, "Let's leave Civil War history behind."
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   And in the context, I was saying something as simple as smiling
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   or something as simple as pulling your pants up
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   can make all the difference in the world.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   And in the context, it was a little bit surprising to me
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   because I was trying to make a point as like,
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   "Stop this whole stupid race crap.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   You've got to get beyond this argument."
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   I went back, I don't know what I was thinking with this,
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   "Let's leave Civil War history behind."
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   It didn't come out right.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   So I actually edited the audio file and removed that.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   And I just said, "Let's dress for success," because that was my point.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   And it was a good reminder to me that--
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   it was a good reminder to me that just sometimes what's in my head doesn't come out clearly.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   My entire point was an anti-racist point.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   The whole point that I was trying to make was get over the racist stuff
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   and get over race stuff and think past that.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   And it came out in a way that evidently ticked off this person.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   And I get that. That's fine.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   And I went back and again, it was a poorly worded comment.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   So I actually--again, I edited the file and I pulled out,
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   "Let's leave Civil War history behind,"
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   because it didn't make any sense in context.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   And I just said, "Let's dress for success."
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   But I do want to talk about that.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   Because--so I did that because I don't want to unnecessarily offend people.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   But the point I was making is that people judge you by the way you look.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   It doesn't matter whether they should or shouldn't.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   They do.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   People judge you by the way you look.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   And I'm going to come back and I'm going to address this.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   You realize you're incredibly privileged as a white man, right?
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   That comment really annoys me.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   But I get why this person says it.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   I'm going to address that in a minute.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   But that wasn't my major point.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000]   The major point was that people judge you based upon the way you look.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   It's 100% irrelevant whether you think they should or whether you think they shouldn't.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   They do.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   And the whole point I was making with "Dress for Success"
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   was go back and research how people judge you based upon the way you look.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   There's a story in "Dress for Success."
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000]   If you've never read it, it's worth reading.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   You can't implement many of the recommendations from the book in today's world.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   Maybe somebody's modernized it. I don't know.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000]   But you can't implement the recommendations because we're in a different culture now.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   But the author of that book, whoever the author was,
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   went out and did surveys--did studies on the streets
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   to see how different people responded to the way that people dressed.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   And the one that I always remember--I think it was the first chapter--
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   he talked about the color of someone's raincoat.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   So the author--I think it was a guy--he set up this story--excuse me, this scenario.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   And it was a busy street going into a busy office building where you had to open the door.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000]   And he wanted to see whether the color of the raincoat that you chose mattered.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   And so he tested--and his whole point was he said that people perceive you
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]   based upon the way that you look.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   And there is a look of power that you can cultivate
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000]   that will enhance the way that you look, and that will help you to be successful.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000]   And so he identifies in very granular detail in that book
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000]   how to dress to cultivate that look of power,
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000]   to cultivate that upper-middle-class look,
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   without looking high upper-class and without looking lower-middle-class,
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   the upper-middle-class look.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000]   So he had set up this experiment with raincoats.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   And he had an actor walk along the street,
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   and this person would arrange to arrive at the door of this office building
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   at exactly the same time as someone else,
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000]   where they each reached for the handle at the same time.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   And then what he tracked--he stood up back and observed and tabulated the results--
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   he tracked the number of times that the person would step back and defer to his actor
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   and say, "Oh, sorry, excuse me," and let his actor through first and defer to them,
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   or how many number of times the person would look at the actor and give him a dirty look
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   and say, "Yeah, I'll go through first."
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   Now, is that imperfect? I think it is.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   I'm more inclined to let people go, and I don't care whether they're lower-class
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   or middle-class or upper-middle-class or anything,
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   but that was the test, as I remember it off the top of my head.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   I learned the book 10 or 15 years ago, so forgive me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty close.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   And then he had the actor do it maybe 100 times wearing a tan raincoat,
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   and he had the actor do it--I don't remember--100 times wearing a black raincoat.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   And what he discovered was that there was a dramatic statistical difference
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000]   between the tan raincoat and the black raincoat.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   And the person with the tan raincoat was allowed through a dramatically higher percentage
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   of the time allowed to go through first, and people deferred to them
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   based upon the fact that they were wearing a tan raincoat instead of a black raincoat.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000]   And the inference from that, the conclusion that he drew,
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   was that you should wear a tan raincoat,
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   because people assume a tan raincoat is a mark of wealthier people, upper-middle-class,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000]   and a black raincoat is a mark of the lower class, the working classes.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000]   And the whole book is filled with these little interesting examples.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000]   I had people go in for a job interview doing certain things.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   And the point was, if you don't know that something small that you do
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   is going to affect the results that you get, that's cruel. You need to know.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000]   And the way that we dress is a big deal.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   People dress the way they do because they're trying to give off an image.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   So my point was that a rap star dresses the way that a rap star wants to dress
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   because they're trying to portray an image of what they're into.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.000]   People who wear camouflage baseball caps and camo t-shirts, or hunting t-shirts,
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   are doing that because they're trying to portray the image that they want to portray.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000]   Rock stars have long hair and wear weird leather pants
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000]   because they're trying to portray a rock star image.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.000]   Lounge singers wear tuxedos. It's all costuming. And it works.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000]   People are usually perceived based upon the way that they dress.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   Now, when you're coming to something like job success,
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   unless you're a rap star, unless you're working in the rap industry, that's a problem.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   Now, if you're working in the rap industry, I would wear baggy pants and whatever,
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000]   big gold chains. I don't know. I'm not a rapper.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.000]   I have a family member who's a rapper. He's white. He dresses like a thug.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:00.000]   Now, I've learned over the years not to judge people so much by how they dress
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   because he's a great guy. But he dresses like a thug.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   And he puts off this image because he's trying to cultivate the image of being a rapper,
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000]   a hip-hop rapper, whatever it's called.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   And so, if you're not aware of that and if you're not doing it intentionally,
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]   you've got to think about who to give up.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.000]   But if you're looking for success, especially with something with financial success,
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   how big of a deal is that?
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   My point was, look at who the leaders in the industry are.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000]   And that was the point I was trying to make with Russell Simmons.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000]   As I said, look at how Russell Simmons dresses.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   Or look at how--who's the other guy I looked up?
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000]   Sean John. Look at how they dress. Look at how these people dress.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.000]   They're not dressing in thug clothing. They're wearing a suit.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000]   They're taking themselves seriously.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   There's good academic statistical research that's done that based upon the way that you dress
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   affects how you feel.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:05.000]   So the way that you feel for work is affected--about your work is affected by how you dress.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:13.000]   So it's a big deal to recognize those things.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000]   Now, I don't have a racist bone in my body.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000]   I don't care about the color that someone is.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   I do get uncomfortable with the way that certain people dress.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000]   There are certain people that I wouldn't be inclined to seek out based upon the way they're dressed.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   I've learned over the years to push past that, because some of the most interesting people that I've met
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   and spoken with are some of the most unique.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   Whether it's the color of their hair, or the pink hair, or the number of tattoos, or the number of piercings,
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000]   I enjoy talking to unique people.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   And I enjoy--fit me personally.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000]   I try to fit in no matter where I am.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   I can comfortably go into a black tie ball, and I can comfortably talk hunting around the back of a pickup truck.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   And there are some places that I fit in better than others.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   So I try to speak past that.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   But the thing is, the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000]   It's all about the way that they dress.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]   And that does matter.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:20.000]   There are people who dress in a way that makes other people uncomfortable.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:27.000]   And that goes with every single color of skin.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.000]   I am very interested in race stuff.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   What's the term for that in academics?
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000]   Sociology? I don't know what it's called.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000]   But I'm interested in that.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   So two stories.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000]   I don't have a racist bone on my body, but I'm interested in how that interacts.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   I went to Egypt some years ago.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000]   And while I was in Egypt--I'm a big guy--and while I was in Egypt, I grew a beard.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000]   I grew a pretty decently thick beard.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   I grew a beard while I was there.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000]   And while I was there, I bought a--it's called a galabeya.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000]   That's the traditional Egyptian--I don't know--smock.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:14.000]   Basically, it's like a knee-length robe type of thing that is traditional in the Muslim-Egyptian culture for men to wear.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000]   And I bought a turban.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000]   And I was interested to see what it would be like.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000]   And at this time, this was 2006, something like that, 2007?
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   It would be 2007 or 2008 maybe, something like that.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   And I flew from Egypt to West Palm Beach via New York City.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000]   And I was interested to see what it would be like, how I would be treated if I--
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   because at this time, racial profiling is all in the news.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:46.000]   I wonder what it would be like to be perceived as a Muslim, as an Egyptian Muslim.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   So I had a thick beard.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000]   I wore the thick red beard. I'm a big guy.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   I wore the galabeya. I wore the turban.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   And I wore it the whole time from Cairo into New York City, got off the plane in New York City,
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:04.000]   and walked around the New York airport, got back on the plane, and flew to West Palm Beach.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000]   And I did the whole time wearing the turban and the galabeya.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000]   It was a fascinating experience.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000]   And undoubtedly, I was pretty uncomfortable getting on the airplane, especially in New York City.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   I was pretty uncomfortable getting on the airplane,
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000]   walking from the front of the plane to the back of the plane without smiling,
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000]   just trying to stay in character because I was just interested to see.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000]   It had a lot of eyes on me, and I felt very conspicuous.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000]   Now, how much of that was racial profiling by other people
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000]   versus how much of that was just my own uncomfort of wearing a dress through the airport?
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000]   I don't know.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]   So I'm interested in that stuff.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000]   I went to--to cry out loud--I went to Haiti on my honeymoon
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000]   because I was interested in seeing Haitian culture.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000]   I went to the Dominican Republic and stayed at a resort, and then we went and traveled around Haiti.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000]   So I don't care what color someone is, but I do care what you do.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.000]   And regardless of what the color is, what good does it do to complain about this?
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000]   I had an experience.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:08.000]   As I was deciding to--and this is why I feel qualified to talk about this stuff
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000]   because I've been through it.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000]   I've experienced it.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000]   And I'm not an expert on everything.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000]   I'm not an expert on every aspect of life or of finance.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000]   Of course not.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000]   There's a lot of things I haven't experienced.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]   I don't know what it's like to grow up in Manhattan.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]   I don't know what it's like to grow up in Spanish Harlem.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000]   I don't know what it's like to grow up in the Bronx in New York.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000]   I don't know what it's like to grow up in Montana.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]   I grew up in West Palm Beach, Florida.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000]   But my point is that--I guess what offends--it offends me to be accused of making a racist comment,
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000]   and that's why I'm spending time on this.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   I don't think race has much to do with it in today's world.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:47.000]   I think that there are a lot of ways that--there are a lot of places maybe where race still does have something to do with it,
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]   but I don't think it has much to do with it.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:58.000]   When I was thinking about closing down my financial planning firm and coming to and starting this podcast,
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:05.000]   I was brainstorming businesses that I could do part-time that would allow me to financially make the transition.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:12.000]   I had some savings, but I made mistakes and put too much money into my house before I planned to leave my financial planning firm.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   When I walked away from my financial planning firm, I walked away from a lot of money
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000]   and a lot of passive income that was providing a pretty nice lifestyle for myself.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   And I had some savings, but I needed to start a new business.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000]   And I was trying to say, "Well, I think I'd like to make this podcast into a business,
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000]   and I'd like to figure out a way to get compensated for doing this,
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000]   because I feel I can really help people. I feel I can bring value to the marketplace,
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000]   and if I can bring value to the marketplace, then ultimately in time, the compensation will follow."
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000]   It's the iron law of compensation.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:47.000]   So I said, "What can I do? What kind of birdbrain thing can I do where I just earn some money?"
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.000]   And so I was trying different things, and I decided, "You know what? I'm going to go and deliver pizzas."
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]   Because I'd heard you could make a lot of money delivering pizzas.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000]   I live in a fairly affluent area, and I said, "Hey, I could deliver pizzas four nights a week."
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000]   I've always wanted to do it, because I always heard Dave Ramsey say, "Go deliver pizzas to pay off your debt."
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000]   And I was curious. I would read blogs of how much people were making.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000]   I said, "This could be a win-win-win. I could earn enough money to pay my bills.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.000]   It's kind of a dead-end job, and I don't want to do it long term.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000]   This would be a fun thing to do for six months, three months, something like that, and I would learn a lot.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   And it would give me a chance." I've never worked in a minimum-wage job. I never have.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:33.000]   I was always fortunate to work in more skilled job positions.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000]   So I went, and I got a job delivering pizzas, and I was being paid minimum wage.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000]   And I learned so much. I'm so glad I did it. I learned so much in that job.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:51.000]   And I was working with a lot of minimum-wage people. We were all minimum-wage people.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000]   But you know what? We were there from every race.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000]   There were white people, there were black people, there were Spanish people.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:03.000]   And I learned in the week. I got to be pretty good friends with some of the people that were there.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:11.000]   And I learned a ton about life.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000]   And the thing is, I found a lot of people that were working there.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.000]   They're actually doing very well financially. I won't betray anybody's anonymity.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   But there was a girl that was working there. She was a teacher during the day,
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000]   and she worked managing the pizza restaurant at night.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000]   And she'd started at the ground level, and she was making a ton of money in her race, and she was black.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000]   Her race had nothing to do with it.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:38.000]   But she had a remarkably different attitude, and she took herself remarkably differently
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.000]   than another black pizza delivery driver who didn't have the same attitude.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000]   And there were some white people there that had a horrible attitude.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.000]   And there was a Pakistani guy that was awesome. He was just a hustler. He worked hard.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:05.000]   So I had my own opportunity to get in for a week and have this insight into that environment.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.000]   And I was convinced that anybody, anybody in that situation that took just a little bit of care,
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   there's not a doubt in my mind that anybody who focused and learned, everything was being taught to you.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000]   There was a curriculum about every single thing that you could learn,
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.000]   and you could be manager of that restaurant in a year.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000]   Now, tip to the wise, I made no money. And I did it for a week, and I was done.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:33.000]   You can't make $30 an hour. I figured if I made $30 an hour, I figured, "Eh, it'd be worth it.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]   It's kind of a bird brain thing. I can just go and do it."
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000]   You can't make $30 an hour, $20 an hour. I averaged it out. I think I made like $11 an hour.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000]   So I did it for a week, and then I quit.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:49.000]   And now I have a far more lucrative deal that pays my bills while I make this business transition.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000]   But that's the point. So let me wrap up here.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   The point is you can't change other people. You can only control ourselves.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000]   So I can't change all the issues with race.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.000]   I don't really care about someone's race, but I do care about who they are.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000]   And who they are is important.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.000]   Martin Luther King said he had a dream that people would be judged by the content of their character
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   rather than the color of their skin.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000]   You can change the content of your character. You can't change the color of your skin.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:23.000]   But even if there is dramatic racism, adjust the way you look.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000]   I've got a ton of friends who are all different backgrounds.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:33.000]   But I don't hang out with people who look sloppy.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.000]   Because there's something about the inner character that reflects in that way.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000]   So change things.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   If you're black and you're worried about this being a racist thing in Civil War history,
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000]   copy Sean John or Russell Simmons.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   Dress like Shaquille O'Neal or Ben Carson or Walter Williams or Thomas Sowell.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   These are guys. Look at the way they dress. Respect yourself.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   And this is for if you're white, don't dress like a thug.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000]   Dress like someone who takes themselves seriously.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]   And is it a costume? Absolutely.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]   And that's why I like Dress for Success.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]   He says if you want to wear--I think this book was written in the '70s--
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.000]   if you want to wear shiny--I have the impression in my mind--disco suits, that's what they call it.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000]   Shiny disco suits on the weekend, fine.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000]   Just don't wear it during work hours.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000]   Racism is a tool that's used for dividing people. It really is.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000]   All these allegations and inferences of racism is used as a tool.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000]   Even slavery was a political tool.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:37.000]   Slavery was on its way out before the Civil War just due to the economic forces.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]   Slavery had already been banned in other countries.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000]   Human slavery that existed in the U.S.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000]   Abraham Lincoln himself said he didn't care about slavery.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]   He wanted to keep the Union together.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000]   Go look up the speech.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]   It says if I could keep the Union together and not do anything about slavery, I would.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   If I can keep the Union together and free some people and keep others enslaved, I would.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000]   If I can keep the Union together and free everybody, then I would do that.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000]   He cared about keeping the Union together.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000]   And slavery was a political tool that was used to give him the support.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000]   Slavery was already on its way out before the Civil War just simply due to the economics.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000]   The northern people, the northern factory owners, had discovered it was far cheaper
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000]   to get somebody to come and work for you for eight or ten or twelve hours a day,
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000]   pay them a wage for their hours, and force them to take care of their own housing,
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000]   their own food, their own shelter, all that stuff,
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.000]   than it was for a southern slave owner to support the whole family.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000]   Now, I'm not for an instant--don't you dare misunderstand me--
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000]   I'm not for an instant condoning enslaving people.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000]   I think it's horrific.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.000]   I think it's horrific and it's horrific.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]   But guess what? We're all slaves now.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.000]   We're all wage slaves.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.000]   And as far as the quality of life, for a lot of us, it's a lot worse as a wage slave
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.000]   than it may have been for some people as a human slave.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:03.000]   Freedom is only good if you take advantage of it and free yourself completely.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:11.000]   Take all that stuff out of context if you wanted to, but it's very much in context.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000]   We all have problems and we all have privilege.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.000]   White privilege--I hate that crap.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000]   I can't do anything to change the fact that I'm a white male.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]   Is there privilege? I don't care if there is.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000]   Guess what? If you can type on a computer, that's privilege.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000]   That means you're educated. You were born in America or wherever you were.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]   The fact that you're listening to this right now indicates that we're privileged.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000]   We all have problems and we all have privilege.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000]   And it's to none of our good if we deny the talents and the abilities
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000]   and the privilege that we have.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000]   We have to do something with it.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000]   I always go back to the parable of the talent. If you read Scripture,
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000]   "To him who has given much, much is required."
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000]   So if you have privilege--and I've got a lot of it.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000]   I've had a pretty good life.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000]   I was raised in a family that loved me.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000]   My parents are together, have lots of wonderful siblings.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:14.000]   My parents worked hard and sacrificed to ensure my success.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000]   I'm blessed with a decent level of intellectual ability.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000]   I've been blessed with a decent level of academic ability.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000]   I've had a lot of opportunity.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.000]   I've had a very privileged and very wonderful life.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000]   And I hope to do exactly the same thing for my son and hopefully future children--
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:38.000]   to give them as much privilege as possible.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000]   But there are people who have come from a far worse situation than I have,
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000]   who have achieved greatly.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000]   Privilege is a gift.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.000]   It's given to us so we can do something with it.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.000]   If you're a white male and you have a lot of privilege, do something with it.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000]   If you're a black female or whatever--I don't even know.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.000]   If you're a black female, you have the privilege of being healthy.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.000]   If you're stuck in a wheelchair because you've got muscular dystrophy or ALS,
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000]   do something.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000]   Do what you can.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.000]   No matter where we're born, we've got to do something.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]   They don't write history about people who sit around and complain about,
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000]   "Yeah, we're full of--a lot of white privilege."
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000]   Do something with what you have.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000]   I absolutely guarantee that I am privileged.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000]   And what's the point?
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000]   I'm trying to do everything I can to help everyone I can
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000]   because that adds value to the world.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000]   And that's the model--add value to the world.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000]   Take the privilege that you have.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000]   Take the abilities that you have.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]   If you have money, use it.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000]   If you have physical talent, use it.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000]   If you have intellectual talent, use it.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000]   If you don't have any of those things and you have labor, use it.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]   Go read a book.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]   Go read the book "The Richest Man in Babylon."
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000]   It's a fable.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000]   It's my favorite personal finance book.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000]   It's written as an allegory, I guess would be the right technical classification for it.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.000]   But it's written as an allegory, and in this allegory,
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.000]   the greatest thing about it is a couple of the stories in it were people who were slaves.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:20.000]   Slavery's been around since long before 1776,
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000]   and black slavery in this country,
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000]   it's been around since the beginning of history.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000]   And guess what? It still exists.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000]   Do something about it.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]   There is sex slavery all over this world.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]   Do something about it.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]   Don't support it.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:39.000]   Whether that's pornography, addiction, or whether that's supporting organizations,
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]   I won't get off on that tangent, but guess what?
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.000]   Slavery still exists in a lot of ways,
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000]   and it's up to us to free ourselves and free other people.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000]   But get back on track, and I've got to wrap up,
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000]   but go read "The Richest Man in Babylon."
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000]   Two of the characters specifically that I can remember in that,
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000]   in about the last half, were slaves.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000]   It talks about what their slavery was like.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:10.000]   My favorite thing about it is that the author didn't go into a moral equivalence about slavery.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000]   I think there's a lot of stuff that's immoral.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000]   I am outraged by human slavery,
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000]   human slavery as it has historically existed throughout history.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000]   I'm equally outraged by wage slavery as it exists today.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000]   I'm equally outraged by academic slavery and control and manipulation
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000]   and the things that occur today.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000]   Why do you think I have this show?
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000]   But the point was that you can't solve those things by sitting around and complaining.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000]   Go and read. I'm not going to spoil the story.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000]   Go read what those slaves did.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000]   Now, is it an allegory? Is it a fable? Is it fictional?
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000]   Yes, it is, but I think the points are true.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:52.000]   My show is all about manipulating and controlling everything that you can control.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000]   So you can go somewhere else.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000]   If you can go somewhere else because Wal-Mart took all the jobs,
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000]   you don't want to work at Wal-Mart, go.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000]   If you can't, then make sure that you're doing the best job you can at Wal-Mart.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000]   If you need to learn a different language, learn a different language.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000]   If that means you came to the United States and you don't speak English, learn English.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000]   If that means that you need to learn Spanish because most of your co-workers are Spanish,
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000]   learn Spanish.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000]   If that means you need to learn Mandarin so that you can take advantage of the growth in Asia
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000]   and move to Singapore, do that.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000]   Control what you can and take responsibility for your life.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000]   If people are prejudiced against you, you can't do anything about that.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.000]   But you can try really hard to put them at ease.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000]   I'm a big guy. I'm 6'6" and I weigh almost 300 pounds. I'm a big dude.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.000]   Guess what? I'm aware of that. I try to make sure that I don't intimidate people.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000]   When I'm speaking to you, if you ever speak to me, one of the things you'll probably find--
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000]   and now that I say it, I'm not going to do it and someone's going to catch me on it--
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000]   but one of the things I've learned to do over time is I very rarely stand face-to-face with people
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000]   and speak directly to them.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.000]   Because of my size, I've learned that that's an intimidating way for people to speak to me
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.000]   because they kind of train their neck up and they don't feel like they have any kind of exit opportunity.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000]   What I've learned over the years, when I'm speaking with somebody and I'm standing,
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.000]   I usually will look for--I'll open up my body so they have an escape route
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]   and I'll stand at a slight angle to them.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000]   I usually will pull back and I give a little bit more personal space than most people do
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000]   because of my size. It puts people at ease.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:32.000]   Or I'll look to sit with someone. I'll sit directly and face you if I'm sitting there
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000]   because then I'm not so intimidating.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000]   But the point is, who cares if people are prejudiced against me or not?
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000]   I've got to deal with what I am.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.000]   So if you're brown or black or white or whatever color you are--
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.000]   and if I'm white--for example, when I went to Haiti, I'm the only white guy around for miles.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000]   I do everything I can to fit in.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:02.000]   If you're the only black guy and you're in a white community, do what you can to fit in.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:09.000]   But, hey, if you want to stand out, that's fine. Go ahead. That's actually a good thing.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000]   So who am I to tell you what to do?
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000]   My point was that sometimes you should adjust the results you get.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000]   When I've been in sales situations in the past, I learned to make people comfortable.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000]   That's how I've learned not to make people uncomfortable.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000]   I'm a big dude. I'm an intimidating guy. I can be an intimidating guy.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000]   So I don't shave my head. And I don't shave my head, grow a goatee,
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.000]   get covered with tattoos and wear white sleeveless T-shirts when I'm going on a sales presentation.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000]   That's a pretty stupid thing to do.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.000]   I comb my hair and I wear low-key clothing, and I try to make people comfortable.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000]   So, ranting over.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000]   Last thing, and then I'm going to play one piece of audio and we're out of here. Long show.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000]   I met a guy a couple of weeks ago at the podcast conference.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000]   I was so inspired by this guy. He is from Venezuela.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.000]   He came to the United States 10 years ago. I think he said 15 years ago, something like that.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.000]   He came when he was a young man. He arrived here with literally $10 in his pocket.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.000]   I think he told me it was $8 or $7 or something like that. Like $10 in his pocket.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000]   He did a lot of stupid stuff, but he worked hard.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:21.000]   Guess what? This guy was telling me he and his wife together, he makes over $100,000 a year now in the U.S.,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000]   something like a decade or two later. I don't remember the exact details.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000]   He blew a ton of money and did some stupid stuff.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000]   But then he figured it out. He started listening to Dave Ramsey, and now he has a podcast.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]   He's trying to encourage other people.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000]   If that guy can do it, he didn't speak a word of English. His English was still heavily accented.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000]   We actually spoke, his English was still heavily accented.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:52.000]   If that guy can do it, there's no reason why a white kid from the slums or a Spanish guy just over the border
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:59.000]   from Venezuela or a black guy from the slums or whatever. Who cares?
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000]   The point is that you've got one life. Don't sit around and deal with it.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:08.000]   I know that's super popular, but hopefully this came out well.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000]   I hate the philosophy behind that, and I get it.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:20.000]   Again, to be clear, I think it's dumb to make people upset unnecessarily.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000]   I try to be very inoffensive.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000]   But on the other hand, we can't walk around on tiptoes about this stuff.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.000]   You've got to say what's actually true and say what works.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000]   That's everything that I wanted to finish up with today.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:40.000]   I'm going to play one video, and this is from Darren Hardy's video series.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000]   This one was part of his a couple weeks ago.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000]   But I just thought this was amazing, and the video was entitled "This Time."
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:53.000]   Darren Hardy is the publisher of Success Magazine, and he publishes a show.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:59.000]   He publishes this series that's every day with a tip for today.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]   I'm going to skip the closing music, and I'm going to end with this
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.000]   because I think it's a good lesson to end with.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000]   I just want to thank you for listening.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000]   I hope that what I said came across.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:15.000]   Frankly, it's uncomfortable to me to talk about some of this stuff
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.000]   because when you put yourself out there as a public figure, you bring the criticism.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:28.000]   But I feel like it's one of those things I have to force myself to push myself out there
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000]   and be courageous enough to share things that I think are true
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000]   and trust that people will find the real message.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000]   I'm going to close with this video.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000]   Thank you for listening to today, and I wish each of you a lovely weekend.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000]   Go away from here with a message from this show,
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.000]   and I hope that this show was helpful.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000]   I'll be back with you on Monday for another exciting week
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.000]   of awesome, comprehensive financial planning knowledge.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:03.000]   [music]
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000]   Someone related a story to me recently about a man in his late 80s
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:11.000]   who was asked if he could come back and live the life of anybody at any time in history
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000]   who he'd wanted to be.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:19.000]   His answer was, "I'd want to come back as the man I could have been but never was."
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000]   He said, "This time I'd act with more courage.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:26.000]   I wouldn't allow my fear to turn me away from opportunities that I didn't take.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000]   I'd risk more. I'd take the chances I wish I had.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000]   I'd allow myself to fail more, love more, and laugh more.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.000]   This time I'd be sure to live more."
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000]   Well, it may be too late for him, but not for you.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000]   But you have to stop the insanity.
