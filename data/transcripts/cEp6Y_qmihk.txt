[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.920]   the Gospel according to St. John in the third chapter of the thirtieth verse.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.600]   The thirtieth verse in the third chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:25.720]   He must increase, but I must decrease.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.640]   He must increase, but I must decrease.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.900]   Those who attend here regularly will know that we've been considering this great and
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.280]   vital statement for a number of Sunday mornings.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.880]   And we are doing so not merely that we may consider it in its own historical context,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:59.280]   which itself is important, but rather as we see it as a principle that governs and controls
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.080]   the whole of our Christian life.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.920]   The immediate occasion, you remember, was the disciples, the followers of John the Baptist,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:17.040]   feeling jealous for their master at the increasing success and popularity of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.440]   And it was in order to silence that folly that John the Baptist uttered these words.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.120]   He points out to them that they don't understand.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.300]   They don't understand who this other person is, nor what he can do.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.960]   If they had that understanding, they wouldn't feel as they do.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.040]   They would rather see that it's inevitable that he should go on increasing because he
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.360]   is who and what he is, and because he is able to bring us such blessings that none other
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.360]   can.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.480]   He's only the friend of the bridegroom.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.480]   He's only the herald.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.160]   He's only the man preparing the way.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   Now that's the context.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.520]   But as I'm saying, there is a great principle enshrined here which governs the whole of
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.040]   the Christian life.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.200]   Christianity means essentially what we are told in the 16th verse of the first chapter
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.680]   of this Gospel of John, "of his fullness of all we received and grace upon grace."
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.280]   That's what Christianity means, to receive of the life and the fullness of the Lord Jesus
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.880]   Christ.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.520]   And the question is, have we received it?
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.160]   Are we receiving it in increasing measure?
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.400]   That is Christianity.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.120]   If we are not doing so, why not?
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.000]   And here we are considering some of the causes, and now in particular this cause.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.680]   And this, I take it, is really the main stumbling block of all in connection with our receiving
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680]   of his fullness.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.840]   It is the self of ours.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.560]   And if we are to grow and to develop in the Christian life and receive increasingly of
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:03.280]   his fullness, well then, I must decrease and he must increase.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.240]   We are looking at this second statement because, after all, this is the key to the art.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.240]   Mere preoccupation with self may even tend to increase our awareness of self.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.680]   There is a negative work in the Christian life, but we must never stop at the negative.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.440]   What really gets rid of self is that he increases, and that we have realized the truth about
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.040]   him as we are meant to do.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.320]   And today, in the New Testament, there is such a wealth of teaching which enables us
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   to do this.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.440]   And what we are doing is, we are more or less following the method adopted by the author
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.320]   of the epistle to the Hebrews, in order that we may see the pre-eminence of our Lord.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.120]   You see, this has always been something that has been necessary for Christian people.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.760]   All our troubles ultimately stem from the fact that we do not realize who he is and
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.600]   what he is and what he can do for us and our position in him.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.440]   That's the source of all our troubles.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.960]   It was the source of the troubles of the early Christians.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.440]   It still is equally true of us.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:22.900]   So we must look at him and consider his pre-eminence, looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.240]   of our faith.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.480]   That is still the main thing that we all have to do, and we have been trying to do this.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.200]   We have been looking at him in his essential glory, in the brightness of God's glory
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.480]   and the express image of his person.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.520]   We look at him in his eternal creatorship.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.080]   We have looked at him also in the great acts of redemption, how he left the courts of glory
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.040]   and came on earth, humbled himself even to the death of the cross, died and was buried,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.200]   rose again, and went back once more to the glory.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.120]   That great sweep, that movement in connection with our redemption.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.320]   And then last Sunday morning we were looking at him as he is displayed to us in the New
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.400]   Testament in terms of his offices.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.120]   Prophet, priest, king, great prophet of our God.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.280]   He is our great high priest likewise, who has passed through the heavens and whoever
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.440]   liveth to make an intercession for us.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.080]   And he is the king seated at the right hand of God, all power given unto him in heaven
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.760]   and in earth.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   And he is coming again to destroy his enemies and to set up his eternal kingdom.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   He is alone.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.160]   There is no one like him.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.800]   We must not put him into any class or category.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.440]   We must not mention any name anywhere near his name.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.640]   There is one and one only.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.640]   He is alone.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.840]   Now that is the way the New Testament puts the teaching concerning him before us.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.000]   And as we look at it he increases in our sight.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.080]   We see him more and more as he is the blessed eternal son of God, who came so low in order
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.720]   that we might live.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.840]   Well we are just completing our study of this.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.160]   It's been inadequate of course.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.040]   This is the theme that could occupy us for the rest of our lives and will be the theme
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.400]   that will occupy us in the glory when we get there.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.880]   That is how they spend their time there.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.320]   They sing the praises of God and of the Lamb.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.960]   Blessing and honor, glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.960]   the Lamb.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.080]   They sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.560]   But we are just glancing at it in order that we may realize that it is as we grasp this
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.800]   teaching and comprehend it in a measure that he increases in our sight more and more as
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   we do so.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.440]   I told before you therefore just one or two other matters this morning.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.240]   Here is again something which shows us his greatness and his glory.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.760]   And that is that he is the head of a new humanity.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.640]   Now here is teaching which is found in the New Testament that we, I fear, do not realize
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.360]   sufficiently and grasp as we ought.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.800]   This idea that we should look at anybody else or that we need any help or any additional
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:44.840]   aid or anyone to supplement what he has done for us and can do for us becomes utterly ridiculous
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.700]   when we realize exactly what God has appointed him to do.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:57.280]   And this is a thing which is well worthy of our consideration and our deep meditation.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.040]   He is the head of a new humanity.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.320]   And that is again another reason for his absolute uniqueness and why it was essential that the
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:14.200]   Son of God should come into the world and why he alone can save us and redeem us.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.120]   God made a man, Adam.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.360]   He was perfect.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.520]   He was made in the image and in the likeness of God.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.880]   But he fell to temptation.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.320]   He could not resist the subtlety and the power of the devil.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:35.440]   How can mankind that has fallen in Adam then be redeemed and restored and saved?
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.960]   Well, it is clear that to make another man, even though he is made perfect, will not solve
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   the problem.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.440]   A perfect man has already proved to be inadequate.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.020]   He has fallen.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:55.320]   And so you begin to see the absolute necessity of the incarnation and the coming of the Son
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.280]   of God into this world.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.160]   And the teaching that we are given concerning him is this, that he is the head of a new
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.160]   humanity.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   Now, this teaching is found mainly in two places in the New Testament.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.240]   It is in the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, and it is in the fifteenth
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.680]   chapter of his first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.560]   And there the point he makes is this, that he makes this great contrast between the first
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.680]   man and the second man.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.480]   And it is indeed one of the most glorious aspects of the whole doctrine of salvation
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   and of redemption.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:43.600]   Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.480]   passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.080]   Now there is one side.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:56.960]   But then he takes it up, for if by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more they
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.080]   which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.520]   by one, Jesus Christ.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.960]   You see, it is this contrast between one man and this other man.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:20.840]   Adam, the Lord Jesus Christ, and in 1 Corinthians 15 it is put still more plainly and explicitly.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.640]   There is this contrast between the first and the second.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.320]   The first man, Adam, was made a living soul.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.680]   The last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.800]   The first man is of the earth, earthy.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.760]   The second man is the Lord from heaven.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:46.640]   And as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy, and as is the heavenly such are
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.680]   they also that are heavenly.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.600]   And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:00.040]   Now this is, I say, a most thrilling concept.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.600]   And it is only as we grasp something of the meaning of that that we shall see how he must
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.760]   inevitably increase.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.120]   This is the only way whereby any single one of us could be saved.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.240]   God is forming a new humanity.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.120]   And the first head of this new humanity is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.640]   John the Baptist can't be the head of a new humanity.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.640]   John is a man.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.240]   He is a fallen man.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.280]   He is one of the children of Adam.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.980]   He is one of this fallen race.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.980]   He cannot be the saviour.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.440]   That's what John is saying.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   He must increase.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   He must decrease.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   He can teach.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.440]   He can baptise.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.920]   But he cannot be the head of a new humanity.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.800]   He cannot be the redeemer, therefore.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.600]   But here is one who is big enough and great enough to be.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.400]   He is the Son of God.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:58.920]   He has taken unto him human nature, purified by the operation of the Holy Spirit in the
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.600]   womb of Mary, as it were.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.040]   And so he has a purified humanity.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.720]   He has linked it to the Godhead.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.600]   He is the head of this new humanity.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:17.320]   And here and here alone is there a true and a real and a secure hope of our salvation.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.640]   Well now, I just leave that thought with you.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.780]   Meditate upon that.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.320]   You can't say that about anybody else.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:32.400]   And that is where they are guilty of such indescribable folly, who put his name even
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.720]   amongst the prophets and amongst the philosophers and others.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.160]   No, no.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.000]   It needed a new man.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.240]   And here he is, the second man, the last Adam.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.240]   And he is none other than this blessed Son of God.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.000]   He came in the likeness of sinful flesh, but he wasn't a sinner.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.320]   Here is something absolutely new, the beginning of a new race of redeemed people.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.040]   And following from that, of course, is the second thing I want to note this morning,
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.520]   which is that he is the head of the Church.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:16.560]   Now, we've seen him as the prophet and the priest and the king.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.600]   We've seen him as the great creator.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:25.800]   But here is something again which is special and unique and which the New Testament isolates
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.320]   and emphasizes as teaching.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.000]   Let me show it to you, for instance, as you have it at the end of the first chapter of
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.640]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:42.280]   And you see how it is singled out and separated from his kingly glory.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:48.680]   The apostle is praying that these Ephesians might understand the greatness of God's power
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.680]   towards them.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:56.320]   He says it's the same power which he exercised or wrought in Christ when he raised him from
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:03.940]   the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:09.920]   and power and might and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this world
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.920]   but also in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:21.680]   Then he goes on, "And gave him to be the head over all things to the Church, which
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.360]   is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all."
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:32.760]   He comes back to that in the fourth chapter of Ephesians in the sixteenth verse.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:39.120]   Talking about our Lord, he says, "From whom," or let me read the fifteenth verse first perhaps,
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:47.560]   "but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things which is the head,
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:56.920]   even Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:03.120]   every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, make
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:09.000]   as increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   What a statement.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.160]   All we are concerned about this morning is this, that the Church is the body of Christ.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.200]   He is the head.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:23.280]   He has been made the head over all things unto the Church.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.200]   Now, here you see is the great central doctrine of the New Testament.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.680]   The redeemed for the time being are in the Church.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.600]   The form that the kingdom of God is taking now is the Christian Church.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.320]   And through the Church, God is again going to make and establish this great kingdom that
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.000]   will cover the whole universe.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.840]   So the Church is of vital significance and importance to us.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:57.160]   And in that connection, there is nothing more important that we should realize, that all
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.080]   that the Church has comes from him.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.480]   He is the head over all things to the Church.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.080]   Every blessing that we have and derive comes from him.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.560]   Our life comes from him, our sustenance, our everything.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.040]   You see, Paul puts it again in writing to the Colossians in these words.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.120]   He prays for these again, "that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:33.080]   love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:40.600]   the mystery of God and of the Father and of Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.440]   of wisdom and knowledge."
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.880]   Now it's all in him.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.560]   Or again, take the phrase at the end of the first chapter of the first epistle to the
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:57.160]   Corinthians, "who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification,
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.160]   and redemption."
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.000]   It's all in him.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   And we derive everything that we have from our contact with him.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Think of it in terms of the analogy of the body.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.320]   All is here concentrated in the head, the brain, if you like, the seat of life and activity
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.320]   and power.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.040]   The body can't function without it.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.400]   There is the central control.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.880]   It all comes out of that.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.040]   And that is the teaching which we are given.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.080]   Well, here once more.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.680]   You see how utterly unique he is?
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.960]   Men can help us in part.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.640]   They can teach us a bit here and a bit there.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:39.080]   I'm not disparaging what men can do for us, but all I'm saying is this, that to put any
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:44.680]   man anywhere near him, or to say that anybody can add to what he's given, it's just ridiculous.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.040]   It's a failure to see his greatness, his glory, his preeminence.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.920]   He must increase, and everybody and everything else must decrease.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.920]   This is the teaching.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.840]   And if you and I are lethargic and are lifeless and are weak and are failing as Christian
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.680]   people this morning, well, shame on us.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.200]   We have no right to be like that.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.520]   There's the energy, the power, the light, the vitality, everything we need.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.740]   It's all in him.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:16.320]   And if we are as I describe, it's because we don't realize that.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.600]   And we are thinking of ourselves, either looking at ourselves and commiserating with ourselves,
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.520]   or trying foolishly to do things in our own energy and strength and power.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.520]   That's the cause of failure.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.800]   It is all in him.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:35.760]   He has been made head over all things unto the church.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.480]   Now this is the kind of thing, you see, that is contained in embryo in this statement of
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.480]   John the Baptist.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:49.440]   How utterly ridiculous and monstrous it is, in any way, as I say, to allow anybody or
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.760]   anything to come anywhere near him.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.760]   No, no.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.760]   He's all.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.760]   He's everything.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.240]   He's complete, beginning and end.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.640]   He is the all and the in all.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:07.200]   Well now, there is the essence of this great doctrinal teaching concerning him, and what
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.000]   we've already seen.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.480]   But now let me move onwards and become a little more practical.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:20.480]   And I do this again, not merely that we may understand the doctrine, but that we may test
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.620]   ourselves and examine ourselves in the light of it.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:30.600]   And in order that we may derive the benefit that we are meant to derive from it, of his
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:37.120]   fullness of all we receive, and grace upon grace.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   Have we, I ask, have we?
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.360]   What can we receive?
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.960]   What has he made possible for us?
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.320]   What is there in him for us?
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:54.920]   This is another excellent way for him to increase in our understanding and in our affections
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.540]   and in our whole outlook.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.220]   What has he made possible for us?
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:06.340]   Well, as you remember, here again is a theme that is developed and worked out by the author
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.060]   of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:14.900]   He starts, you see, by pointing out the essential preeminence of our Lord over prophets and
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.180]   angels and Moses and Aaron.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.780]   He is beyond everybody as prophet, priest, and king.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.460]   Ah yes, is this man.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:31.860]   But because of that, because of that, he is the mediator of a new covenant.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.460]   Now here is again a great biblical principle.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:43.540]   This whole question of covenants between God and men and all our blessings arise from the
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:48.620]   fact that we have a covenant making and keeping God.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.380]   God does not merely bless us.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.020]   He tells us what he is doing, and he tells us why he does it.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.140]   He makes a covenant, makes an agreement.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.140]   You know what a covenant is?
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.740]   It is drawn up by a solicitor or somebody and you sign it.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.820]   It is a deed, a legal deed, a covenant, testament.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.740]   Well now, God has always dealt with mankind in that way.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.540]   He is a covenant making and keeping God.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.780]   And this man takes up this idea.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:22.320]   He was writing to Hebrew Christians, and of course they were well aware of this teaching.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:29.380]   It was their proud boast as Jews that God had made a covenant with their father Abraham.
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:35.180]   And he had renewed it as it were with Moses, the great law giver, and had defined it further
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.180]   in that enactment.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.460]   So they knew all about the covenant.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.580]   That is why we call the Old Testament the Old Testament.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.580]   It is the old covenant.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.540]   It is the account of the old covenant.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:50.780]   The new is the new covenant, the new testament which God has made with mankind.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.780]   Now this man takes up all this, and it is a very important thing that we should understand
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.500]   something about this.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:05.260]   He argues that there is a kind of correspondence between the mediator of the covenant and the
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.260]   nature of the covenant.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.020]   And that of course is what we would expect.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:16.780]   The covenant that the Jews were most concerned about was the covenant as made through Moses,
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.900]   the Ten Commandments, the moral law, and all that was involved in that.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.300]   They were proud of this.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.380]   They said God has given us his oracles.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.860]   The other nations had not got the oracles of God.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.380]   They were pagans outside.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:39.020]   As Paul reminds the Ephesians, they were strangers, they were outside the covenant.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.260]   Here are his exact words.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:46.100]   He at that time was without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:53.300]   strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.540]   Now they were very proud of this.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:01.140]   And here they were, these Hebrew Christians, because of the persecutions they were enduring
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.900]   and various other problems and difficulties, they were beginning to look back to the old
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:11.700]   dispensation, looking back with longing eyes to the temple, threatening to go back to the
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.700]   Jewish religion.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.380]   And this man says, "You don't realize what you're doing.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.100]   You don't realize who it is you're turning from, but you don't realize the covenant
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.100]   you're turning from."
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.620]   He says, "Are you going back to the old covenant?
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:30.420]   Don't you realize the character and the nature of the new covenant?
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.020]   Don't you realize what has been made possible for you in and through the Lord Jesus Christ?"
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.340]   He said, "Look here, you mustn't go back to that.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.980]   We have such a high priest who is set at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.540]   the heavens, a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tavern at which the Lord pitched
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.260]   and not man.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.020]   Every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices, wherefore it is of necessity
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.980]   that this man have also something to offer."
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.620]   And on he goes with this great argument.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:04.460]   But now he says, "Hath he obtained a more excellent ministry?
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.380]   By how much more also?
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:13.180]   He is the mediator of a better covenant which is established upon better promises."
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.540]   Now here is the comparison.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.020]   There are the children of Israel.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.580]   God is going to deliver them from the bondage and the captivity of Egypt and take them into
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.820]   Canaan.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:29.580]   So he comes down and he makes a covenant with them through the mediation of Moses,
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.580]   his servant.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.740]   It was a wonderful covenant.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.820]   But says this man, "Though that was wonderful, it was nothing when you put it by the side
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.480]   of this.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.340]   It was only temporary to start with.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.700]   It only had temporal blessings in a sense.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.420]   The main blessings were temporal.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:54.580]   But when you put it by the side of this, you see how lacking it was in spirituality."
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.580]   And so on.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.660]   That's why, you see, a man was good enough to be the mediator of that, but a man is not
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.380]   good enough to be mediator of this.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.740]   This is a better covenant established on better promises.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:13.860]   And so he opens their understanding to the better things that come to us through the
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.620]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:21.260]   And that is what makes it so tragic, leave alone pathetic, that people should be turning
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:28.780]   back in any sense to an old ceremonial type of religion instead of realizing the spirituality
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.900]   of this and all the fullness that it contains.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.220]   Well now, what does he mean?
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.580]   What's he talking about?
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:43.820]   Well again, we are here looking and glimpsing into the essential glory of this Christian
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.540]   salvation.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:51.700]   And my dear friends, it's something that so transcends human ability and understanding
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.820]   that nothing but the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit can enable us even to glimpse
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.060]   of it.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:03.820]   And that is why, you see, Paul prays for the Ephesians a prayer like this.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:08.340]   He says, "I cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:14.900]   that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:20.260]   of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him."
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.700]   Do you pray that prayer for yourselves?
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.660]   Or do you think you've got it all in a packet?
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.940]   Got it all when you took your decision?
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.540]   Got the whole of Christianity, you know, you just go on living.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.380]   Do you pray that you may have this spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.380]   of him?
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.220]   Do you spend any time in looking into this mystery?
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.100]   He's praying that the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.540]   Remember, he's writing to Christian people.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:52.740]   Here are people who believe the gospel, they've been sealed by the Holy Spirit, he reminds
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.580]   them, and yet he prays for them.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.500]   That the eyes of their understanding may be enlightened.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   What for?
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:04.380]   "That you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:11.740]   of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.700]   us that believe."
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.740]   Here we are, failing, faltering, stumbling.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:24.100]   It's because we don't know the exceeding greatness of his power to us that believe.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.820]   There is one statement of it, but take another.
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:32.660]   He goes on in the third chapter of that same epistle to say this, that he is praying for
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.660]   them.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:38.900]   "I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:44.020]   For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.020]   What for?
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:50.980]   "Well, that he should grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:28:00.620]   with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith;
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:07.860]   that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints."
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:08.860]   What?
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:15.700]   "Well, what is the breadth and length and depth and height, and to know the love of
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:22.580]   Christ, which passeth knowledge, that he may be filled with all the fullness of God."
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.980]   That's it.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.780]   And you see, already he has put it like this.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.780]   This is what we are talking about.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:34.700]   He is talking about his calling as an apostle, whereof, "I was made a minister according
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:41.340]   to the gift of the grace of God, given unto me by the effectual working of his power;
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:46.260]   and unto me one less than the least of all saints is this grace given."
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.260]   What for?
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:56.180]   "That I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ."
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.020]   That's it.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:04.180]   That's the content of the better covenant, the new covenant.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.860]   Unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.260]   Here are Hebrew Christians turning back to the temple, wanting to go back to the Jewish
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:12.260]   religion.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.500]   "Ah, they say, this Christianity, ever since I've been in it, I've only had persecution
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.500]   and suffering.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.140]   I don't seem to be getting much out of it."
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.980]   And there are Christian people who talk like that.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.060]   They say, "What's in this Christianity?
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.540]   Shall we keep on with it?
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.660]   Is it worth going on with?
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.140]   Hadn't we better follow the crowd that's already turned its back upon it?"
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.140]   What's the matter with them?
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:35.420]   "Well, it's just that they've never even heard of or known nothing about the unsearchable
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:42.060]   riches of Christ, the new covenant, this new arrangement that God has made, the new pledge,
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.060]   the new promise.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.540]   Better covenant, better promises."
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:51.020]   Here it is, my friends, and it's only as you begin to understand these that you see
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.700]   him growing and becoming yet more glorious in your sight.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.460]   He increases and you feel that you're just nothing.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.860]   And another way, if you like, in which I can put it is this.
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:08.540]   Here we are, we're going to come to this Lord's Supper, we're going to come to the Communion
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.860]   table.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.740]   And when we come to it, I'm going to read these words.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:22.860]   I'm going to read those words that the apostle wrote to the Corinthians, the first epistle,
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.140]   and this is how he wrote to them.
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:30.140]   "I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus,
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.460]   the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.100]   And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'Take it, this is my body which
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.300]   is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me.'
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:46.060]   After the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped, saying, 'This cup is
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:54.780]   the new testament, the new covenant in my blood.'
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:59.100]   This do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me."
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.580]   You see, that's the meaning of this.
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.780]   What we rarely do when we come here to eat the bread and to drink the wine is to remind
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.980]   ourselves of the terms of the new covenant.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.660]   That's what it's for.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:18.420]   It is to remind us of all that he has made possible for us, by his life, death, resurrection,
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.900]   intercession, by all he is.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.700]   We're reading the will again, we're reading the title deeds again.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:28.380]   Read the second half of the ninth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews and you'll
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:34.140]   find it's worked out there, how the testament is of no value until the death of the testator.
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.260]   He makes his will but he's got to die before you get the benefits.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:42.380]   That's what we're doing there, we're reading the title deeds, reading the will, reminding
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.580]   ourselves of all the promises of the new covenant.
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.540]   Here it is.
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:52.260]   And if you and I are unhappy Christians this morning, it is because we don't know the
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.420]   will.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:58.460]   We don't know the terms of this new, this better covenant he puts aside, the first,
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.080]   that he may establish the second.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.580]   This better covenant, this greater covenant, which he has made with mankind through his
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.020]   own son.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.020]   What does it mean?
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.660]   Well, let me just mention some of the items in the will for you.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.540]   This is what he's made possible.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:20.580]   That old covenant, yes, he told us how to live but he didn't give us the power to do
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.260]   so.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:26.700]   The high priest went in once a year into the holiest of all, taking the blood of a bull
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.020]   or of goats that he'd shed, and he presents it.
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.020]   What's it do?
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.020]   Does it get rid of our sins?
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.020]   No.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.860]   It just covers them.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.220]   It was a temporary covering.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.300]   It makes us ceremonially clean.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:46.540]   He argues there, you see, that if all that, he says, was able to do something with regard
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:54.700]   to the body, carnal ordinances, he called them, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:59.940]   The blood of bull, blood of goats and of cows is all right, he says, for the sprinkling
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:06.140]   of the unclean and sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.140]   But it can't do any more.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:12.940]   He's argued that again in great detail in the seventeenth chapter.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:18.220]   The law made nothing perfect, but it was the bringer in of a better hope by the which we
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.300]   draw nigh unto God.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.840]   Now that's the way in which this great argument must be worked out.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:33.300]   So what we remind ourselves is this, that in the Lord Jesus Christ we are first and
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:37.660]   foremost forgiven freely, perfectly, completely.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:44.900]   The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin and unrighteousness.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:51.060]   How much more shall the blood of Christ go through the eternal Spirit, offered himself
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:59.500]   without spot unto God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.860]   And you see, it does more than that.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:07.660]   It means that we have died with him.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:12.820]   There's the law that is ever against us.
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:18.460]   But in Christ, according to this teaching, we are dead to the law, because we have died
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.460]   with him.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:26.080]   Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one of the believers.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:31.060]   If you are a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, if you are a regenerate person, you have died
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.540]   with him.
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.500]   When he died, you died.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.820]   The argument of Romans 5 is this, as you remember, that when Adam sinned, we all sinned in him.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.520]   He was the first man, he was the representative.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.380]   He fell, we all fell with him.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.780]   Death passed upon all men, for that all sinned with Adam.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.020]   But correspondingly, when Christ died, we died.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.460]   He died for us, yes, but we died with him also.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:03.340]   Now this is where you see the excellence of this new government, that we are not merely
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.060]   forgiven, we are dead to the law.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:11.860]   That which held us in bondage is dead, Paul argues in Romans 7.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.700]   Or let me put it like this.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.900]   We're all born into this world the children of Adam.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.140]   There's no choice about that, we can't help it.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.880]   We are, inevitably, the children of Adam.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.580]   We inherit his nature, we inherit everything that was true of him, but the most important
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:33.020]   thing is that we are in Adam.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.500]   But the moment you are regenerate and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, you're no longer
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.900]   in Adam, you're in Christ.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:48.540]   Knowing this, says Paul in Romans 6, 6, that our old man was crucified with him, the old
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.460]   man as God, he's dead, he's finished with him.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.020]   I am no longer in Adam, I am in Christ.
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:36:00.420]   Now this is the most amazing, liberating thought a man can ever come across, I have confessed
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.860]   it from this pulpit on previous occasions.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:10.060]   That to me has been the single most liberating thing I have ever discovered in the New Testament.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.300]   The death of the old man.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.860]   It's not something that I've got to do, it has happened on the cross.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:25.380]   As I sinned in Adam, so I died in Christ, to the law and to that old Adamic nature.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:31.620]   Not only have we died with him to the law and to the Adamic nature, we have also risen
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.620]   with him.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.140]   See, this is the argument.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:38.980]   We have risen with him in newness of life.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:44.940]   All these great affirmations, asseverations, what can I call them, which are made by the
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.660]   great apostle.
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.700]   If we be planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.700]   of his resurrection.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:59.860]   Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:05.380]   Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, and so on.
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:09.620]   In that he died, he died unto sin once, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:17.340]   You guys reckon yourselves also, realize that you also are dead indeed unto sin, but alive
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.820]   unto God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.460]   Nobody else can do this for you.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.220]   No man can help you, he can't do it for himself.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.540]   We are dead to sin and alive unto God.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.900]   We begin to live for the first time and we live to God.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:38.300]   We share the life of God, it's all open to us by this blessed Savior.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:43.620]   And so he appeals to us, he says, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, neither
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:50.460]   yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God as
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.140]   those that are alive from the dead."
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.620]   Do you realize that my friend?
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.860]   You're alive from the dead.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:03.460]   You no longer belong to the realm of existence, you're living, you're being raised with Christ
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.860]   because you're in him, and all that's happened to him has happened to you.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.580]   That's the teaching.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.820]   Alive in him, the living head.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.660]   Alive unto God.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:19.980]   Sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:27.220]   Well here it is, time fails us as I told you, we could go on forever on such a theme.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:31.260]   But here are the elements of this glorious position in which we are.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:39.100]   And in addition to this, you see, we are being formed anew after his image.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.140]   We are partakers of this new humanity.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:48.580]   As we had descended formerly from the first Adam, we now descend from the second Adam.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:54.980]   New humanity, a new race of people, gathered out of every tribe and nation under heaven,
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.420]   redeemed by the gospel.
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:01.820]   Yes, not merely forgiven, but born again, made partakers of the new nature, the new
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:05.340]   humanity, put into the new kingdom, put into the body.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:09.900]   Here it is, a new race of men, God's children.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.220]   That's it.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.380]   And this goes on.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:20.940]   And in this position we become partakers of these unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:21.940]   What are they?
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:29.060]   Well, let this man put it to us again in that eighth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.060]   This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.060]   the Lord.
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:39.380]   I will put their laws into their mind.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.860]   God gave the children of Israel laws through Moses.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.140]   Where did he put them?
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.540]   On tables of stone, outside them.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.780]   There they were.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.220]   Do this, do this, don't do that.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:53.100]   The law on tables, written on stones, external.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.060]   And that's why nobody can keep them.
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.260]   But here you see there's a better covenant, and this is what it does.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.020]   It takes the law of God and puts it into my mind.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:11.180]   I will put them into their mind and write them in their hearts.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.940]   What a wonderful redemption, what a Savior.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.860]   The whole trouble about keeping a law is this, isn't it?
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.740]   That your heart is against it, you don't like it, you prefer the evil, you prefer the
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:26.180]   sin, and you're always fighting with your heart and trying to exert your willpower against
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.820]   your mind and against your heart in particular.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:34.860]   But here is a new covenant, and the law is in my mind and written in my heart, engraved
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.860]   there.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.860]   I'm in favor of it, my heart is on its side.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.100]   The commandments are no longer grievous.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.940]   I rejoice to do thy will, O my God.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:51.540]   Not only that, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.660]   Listen, and they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying,
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.180]   "Know the Lord."
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:03.900]   It isn't to be a matter of external instruction and classes and memorizing, not at all.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:10.340]   "Know the Lord, know, know, for all shall know me from the least to the greatest."
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.180]   It's something internal, it's the operation of God.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:17.820]   God manifests himself within us and in us, reveals himself in us.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:23.580]   And I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.980]   Will I remember no more?
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:28.580]   Well, here are something of the terms of the new covenant.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:35.300]   The Holy Spirit is put within us, and he works in us both to will and to do of God's good
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.300]   pleasure.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:42.420]   He strengthens us, he gives us ability, he creates within us a great desire to live to
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.220]   the glory of God.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:50.660]   Let me sum it up in the words of Paul, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:58.340]   are in Christ Jesus, for the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.100]   from the law of sin and death."
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:08.100]   I'm delivered, I'm emancipated, there is a grand redemption, my soul is free.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:15.140]   And even I have the promise of the redemption of this very body in which I still live.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:20.980]   If you're in Christ, says Paul to the Romans, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.140]   is life because of righteousness.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:28.980]   But if the Spirit of him that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you, he by that selfsame
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:33.500]   Spirit shall even quicken your mortal bodies.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:39.180]   The redemption of the body and a final and an ultimate glorification.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:43.620]   Well now, how inadequate all this is.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:50.260]   I've simply opened the will before you and mentioned some of these salient glorious items
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:52.020]   that are to be found in it.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:57.260]   And all that is offered to you, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all the fullness of the
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.020]   Godhead, this is it, all in him.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.020]   He alone can mediate such a covenant and he's done so.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.060]   He must increase, of course.
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.220]   He's alone, no one else can.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.340]   He is the second Adam, he is indeed the last man.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:14.860]   Very well.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:21.220]   For me to bring this to a very practical conclusion, I want to ask you some questions before we
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.860]   leave it.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:32.220]   I've been holding the doctrine concerning him before you and I trust that as I've been
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:40.020]   doing so, he has been increasing in your mind, in your heart, and in the whole of your life.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:43.900]   But let me test it.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.500]   Has that been the case?
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.620]   Do you find complete satisfaction in him?
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.940]   That's the test.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:44:00.780]   Object of my first desire, Jesus crucified for me.
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:06.580]   Can you say honestly, thou, O Christ, art all I want?
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.820]   More than all in thee I find.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.820]   Do you?
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:10.820]   You should.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.900]   In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.620]   It's all in him, everything.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.860]   Do you find it in him?
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.740]   All you need and infinitely more.
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:31.020]   Jesus, thou joy of loving hearts, thou fount of life, thou life of men, from the best bliss
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:36.860]   that earth imparts, I turn and feel to thee again.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.460]   Can you say so?
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:50.980]   Thou hidden source of calm repose, thou all-sufficient love divine.
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.260]   Is he that to you?
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:58.060]   Plenteous grace in thee is found, grace to cover all my sin.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:02.220]   Let the healing streams of bone make me, keep me pure within.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:09.780]   Thou of life, the fountain of, freely let me drink of thee.
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:14.060]   Spring thou up within my heart, rise to all eternity.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.220]   Is that true, my dear friend of you?
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:21.300]   Have you found final, complete satisfaction in him?
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.060]   Have you ever gone to him in vain?
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.020]   Has he ever failed you in any respect?
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.220]   If he has, it's because you don't know him.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:33.380]   It is all in him, the fountainhead.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:39.020]   And he gives complete and final satisfaction.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:42.620]   Or let me try a second question.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:47.420]   Are you desiring to know him more and more?
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:48.940]   That's the test.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:55.260]   If you see his glory, his preeminence, his greatness, if he is increasing in your sight,
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:02.180]   well then you'll say with the apostle Paul, "Oh, this is it, that I may know him, and
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:07.380]   the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:12.820]   his death, if I might by any means attain unto the resurrection from the dead, not
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.260]   as though I had already attained."
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.180]   Are you self-satisfied?
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.540]   If you are, my dear friend, it's because you don't know him.
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:21.540]   You haven't got it all.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.740]   Don't let the devil delude you.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.220]   You can never get it all.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:32.780]   Not that I have already attained, but I might know him.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:33.780]   Or let me try another question.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:41.500]   Have you got an increasing concern for his glory and the extension of his kingdom?
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.460]   John the Baptist said it.
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:47.900]   He must increase, I must decrease.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:48.900]   He is the bridegroom.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.340]   I am only the friend of the bridegroom.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:56.380]   Have you seen him in his glory, and do you long to see his kingdom extended?
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.060]   Do you long to see people bowing the knee to him?
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.220]   Do you want him to be made greater and greater?
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.940]   Do you want to magnify him in the sight of all?
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:09.980]   It's a sure sign of having seen his greatness and his glory.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:15.900]   And finally, do you long for his appearance?
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:21.900]   You look upon this old, sinful, war-ridden world, and you see its hopelessness and its
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.900]   despair.
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:30.980]   You have long since seen through the folly of trusting to any action on the part of men.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:37.060]   And you have come to the conclusion which Paul presses upon Titus, "The grace of God
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:44.140]   that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:51.780]   and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world,
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:58.860]   looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.940]   Christ."
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:04.140]   The whole of the New Testament is looking forward to this.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:10.620]   "O," says Paul again to the Philippians, "our citizenship is in him.
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:17.060]   And whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change this,
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:23.580]   our vile body, the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:29.460]   body, the body of his glorification, according to the working whereby he is able even to
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.980]   subdue all things unto himself."
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.500]   Are you looking forward to that?
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.460]   Do you realize you are in a passing world?
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:42.220]   Here we know continuing cities, but we seek one to come?
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:46.340]   Are you looking for a city that has foundations, whose builder and maker is God?
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:51.260]   Are you looking for the crowning day which is coming, when the Son of God shall return,
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.980]   conquering all his enemies, and set up this kingdom in which we shall be glorified and
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.380]   spend our eternity with him?
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.100]   These are the questions.
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:07.500]   As he increases in our sight, these are the inevitable reactions.
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:12.500]   What can we do about this, therefore?
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:16.140]   And the instruction is quite simple.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:20.100]   The first is, count your blessings.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:26.300]   Count your blessings, name them one by one, and it will surprise you what the Lord hath
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.300]   done.
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.620]   When you feel tempted to grumble and to complain and to ask your questions, "Why this and
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:32.020]   that?"
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:35.140]   Count your blessings.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:40.220]   And realize that every one of them has come to you because God so loved the world that
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:45.900]   he gave his only begotten Son, and all that we have been looking at happened.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.620]   Count your blessings.
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.620]   What else?
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:53.620]   Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.460]   And again I say rejoice.
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:00.220]   In other words, when you look at the world and you are depressed, when you look at yourself
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:05.060]   and you are depressed, when things happen that depress you, don't look at them.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.340]   Look at him.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.020]   Realize the truth about him.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.420]   Realize that you are in him.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:14.300]   Realize that though the world, the flesh, the devil, and all hell fight against you,
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.940]   you are safe, you are secure, and your destiny is secure.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:21.140]   The glorification is to come.
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:27.060]   Rejoice in the Lord always, everywhere.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:31.420]   And again I say rejoice.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.420]   What else?
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.700]   Here it is.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:41.180]   The apostle has put it again in writing, the second epistle to the Corinthians at the end
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:45.060]   of the third chapter.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:53.500]   We all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:51:04.380]   same image as by the Spirit of the Lord, from glory to glory, changed from glory into glory,
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:13.220]   till in heaven we take our place, till we cast our crowns before him, lost in wonder,
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.740]   love, and praise.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.260]   Look at him.
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.620]   Your face has been opened.
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.860]   The veil has been taken away.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:29.100]   We all with open face, without a veil, beholding, looking, gazing intently upon the glory of
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:32.500]   the Lord.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:40.540]   As you spend time in doing that, in all his glory, his essential glory, in the glory of
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:45.340]   his offices, in the glory of his work, in the glory of all he has made possible, as
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:53.700]   you look at it and dwell upon it and meditate upon it, as you do so, he will increase and
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:58.100]   you will decrease.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:10.580]   You lose yourself in him and be lost in wonder, love, and praise.
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.800]   Amen.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.720]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
