[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   The book of Joshua is found in the Old Testament in the book of Joshua, in the fourth chapter,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.360]   beginning at the first verse. The book of Joshua, chapter 4, beginning at the first
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:23.920]   verse. And it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the Lord
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:32.080]   spake unto Joshua, saying, Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:40.880]   a man, and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.880]   place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones; and ye shall carry them over
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:57.280]   with you, and leave them in the lodging place where ye shall lodge this night. Then Joshua
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.800]   called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:12.320]   a man. And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.760]   midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.560]   unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, that this may be a sign among you,
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.920]   that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.560]   stones? Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.800]   of the covenant of the Lord, when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:59.760]   off; and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. And
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.240]   the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.040]   of Jordan, as the Lord spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.160]   children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged,
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.760]   and laid them down there. And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.840]   place where the feet of the priests which bear the ark of the covenant stood; and they
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   are there unto this day. For the priests which bear the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.480]   until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to speak unto the people,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.400]   according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hasted and passed over. And
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.040]   it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the Lord
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.960]   passed over, and the priests in the presence of the people. And the children of Reuben,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.880]   and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.560]   children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them. About forty thousand prepared for war passed
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.040]   over before the Lord unto battle to the plains of Jericho. On that day the Lord magnified
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.720]   Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him as they feared Moses all the days
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.160]   of his life. And the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying, Command the priests that bear the
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.720]   ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan. Joshua therefore commanded the
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.800]   priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan. And it came to pass, when the priests that
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.840]   bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.400]   soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:24.280]   returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks as they did before. And the
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:32.880]   people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:41.680]   in the east border of Jericho. And those twelve stones which they took out of Jordan did Joshua
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:50.120]   pitch in Gilgal. And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.440]   ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? Then ye shall let
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:06.080]   your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land; for the Lord your
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:14.640]   God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.200]   your God did in the Red Sea, when he dried up from before us which he dried up before
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:29.680]   us, until we were gone over. That all the people of the earth might know the hand of
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:39.800]   the Lord, that it is mighty that ye might fear the Lord your God for ever. May God add
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.240]   his blessing to the reading of his holy word.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:58.960]   I would like to call your attention this morning to that incident in the life and the story
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.760]   of the children of Israel which we read at the beginning in the fourth chapter of the
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:12.600]   book of Joshua. Let me read again from verse 19 to the end of verse 24. And the people
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.240]   came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:27.000]   the east border of Jericho. And those twelve stones which they took out of Jordan did Joshua
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.360]   pitch in Gilgal. And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:42.040]   ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? Then ye shall let
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:51.200]   your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land; for the Lord your
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:58.200]   God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:06.120]   your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.520]   That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty that
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:24.800]   ye might fear the Lord your God for ever. This incident here in the life of the children
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   of Israel is one which I feel is of very great importance and has a message to give to all
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:40.680]   of us who are members of the Christian Church at this present time. For in its own way and
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:49.200]   in its pictorial and dramatic manner, it really does remind us of what is the function and
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:57.160]   the purpose of the Church. Now I need scarcely tell you that there is a great deal of confusion
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:04.200]   about this very thing at the present time. And people have all sorts and kinds of strange
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:12.080]   notions and ideas as to what is the business of the Christian Church. Well it seems to
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.440]   me to be epitomised here perfectly in what the children of Israel did at the command
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:24.840]   of Joshua, who was simply obeying the command of God. You remember, they had come through
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:30.160]   the wilderness and now they were on the point of entering the land of promise. But they
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.920]   had the Jordan to cross and they were enabled to cross it in a remarkable manner. God worked
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:46.040]   a miracle. But he did this extraordinary thing that is recorded in this chapter. He told
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:52.280]   Moses to pick out twelve of the leaders of the tribes of Israel and that each one of
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:59.960]   these men was to take up a stone from the bed of the Jordan. The Jordan was divided,
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.400]   you remember, so that they went through on dry land. And God commanded them to take up
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:13.080]   twelve stones from the bed of the river and then to erect these twelve stones on the other
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:22.760]   side, on the Canaan side, in order that they might be a permanent memorial. So that in
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:30.160]   future ages when children and others should ask, "What's the meaning of these stones?
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:38.440]   What do they represent?" Well, the children of Israel would be able to give the answer.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:47.480]   In other words, these stones had the message to deliver to all subsequent generations.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:54.400]   And that seems to me to be a very perfect picture and representation of what is really
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:02.960]   the function and the purpose of the Christian Church. What is it? Well, now let me note
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:09.400]   some of the things with you of which we are reminded here.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:15.440]   The first thing, and in many ways one of the most important of the present time, is that
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:24.160]   we should always realize that the Church is here to remind people of history, of certain
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:32.800]   great historical events. That is the primary business of the Church. This is the message
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.960]   of the Church. When people pass this building, for instance, and say, "Well, now what is
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:44.880]   that?" It calls itself a Christian Church. It's a building in which Christian people
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:52.600]   meet together. But what's it all about? What is it? People today have very little conception
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:11:00.280]   of this, and they are confused, and unfortunately they are partly confused by what they hear
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.920]   on the television and the wireless in the name of Christianity so often, and what they
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:12.800]   read in the papers. And they've got entirely false notions as to what the Christian message
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.920]   really is. Now my point is that first and foremost, it
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:29.320]   is a reminder of certain events, actions, acts, which have taken place in history. Let
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:38.480]   me put it negatively. The Church is not simply a place in which a certain teaching is put
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:46.240]   before people. Now, you know, the world, it has its teachings. There are societies in
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.760]   the world, and they have a teaching which they propagate. The world is full of them
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.720]   at the present time. Some of them are very learned. There are people who call themselves
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:05.680]   philosophers, and they claim to be studying life. They try to discover what is the matter,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.000]   what's the cause of our problems, and what we've got to do in order to live a happy
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.600]   and a harmonious life. It's called philosophy, the study of wisdom. It's a teaching. There
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.920]   are various teachings. There are various schools, and they have arguments with one another,
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:28.240]   learned arguments, and people think it's all very interesting. They are representatives
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:36.360]   of teachings. In the same way, you have political theories and ideas, and all these again are
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.000]   presented to us, and we're asked to listen to them and to accept them.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.040]   Now the point about all these is that they are teachings, points of view. And indeed,
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:58.920]   this is also true of what we may describe as religion. Religion as such is simply views
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.160]   of men with regard to life in this world. It doesn't matter which religion you take.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.520]   Some of these ancient religions of the East, the Confucianism of China, the Buddhism of
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:16.760]   China and India, and Mohammedanism, Hinduism, all these religions, what are they? Well,
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:23.680]   they're teachings. There are teachings which are given to people, telling them how to view
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.920]   life and urging them to do so. And at the same time, they tell them that they've got
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.040]   to live in a certain way, they may have elaborated certain ceremonies and certain ritual, and
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:44.240]   so on. But it's all a matter of teaching, which is presented to people. And then there
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:51.600]   are certain societies, ethical societies as they're called, which don't believe in religion
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.440]   at all, but do believe that people should be taught how to live. And they put these
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   ideas forward.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:07.880]   Well now, the thing that marks off the Christian faith, the message of the Bible, from all
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:18.800]   these others, is that this is primarily a record of historical facts, events. This is
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:28.440]   not a theory, this is not an idea. It's not primarily a teaching. It is primarily a great
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:34.840]   record of history. And that is why, as you read your Bible from beginning to end, you
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:42.600]   find there is so much history in it. In all these others that I've mentioned, the historical
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:50.000]   element is virtually absent. It doesn't really matter at all. There are certain names
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   attached, but you could have the teaching and the theory without the names. But here,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.240]   the facts are vital. They're essential. They are the basis of everything. And then
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:16.080]   I must add to that immediately, that this history, which is a record of facts and events,
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:24.560]   is not the record or the history of what men have done. It is the history of what God has
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:30.280]   done. See, that's the thing that's emphasized here. That all the people of the earth might
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:35.640]   know the hand of the Lord, what God has done.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:43.000]   Now this, as you can see, is a very important and crucial matter. All the teachings to which
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.600]   I've been referring have been started by men, by one man or by a group of men. And
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:56.200]   they've been added to and elaborated, but it's all coming from men. Men's ideas and
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:04.880]   theories and so on. Now this is entirely different. This is a record of what God has done. That's
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:12.760]   the first verse in the Bible. "In the beginning, God." He created, He acted. And the Bible
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:23.160]   is really nothing but a record of the great acts, the actions of God, and the meaning
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:30.240]   and the object of those great actions. And the task of the Church, I say, is to remind
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:38.000]   people of these. And never was this more necessary than at the present time. When we are attending,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.760]   we're attending to worship man. And always talking about what man can do, what man can
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:51.200]   invent, what man can propose, and so on. Now here we're in an entirely different realm.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.640]   The history of what man has done is quite important. I'm not here to detract from it
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:01.960]   at all. Thank God for every great human achievement and every advance that has been made. Thank
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:08.800]   God for great men who've been benefactors to the human race. But in this realm, it's
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:17.640]   entirely different. We are to consider what God has done. And this is the thing we need
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:24.640]   to lay hold of, because it is our only hope in the end. As the psalmist puts it, "I have
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:34.480]   seen an end to all human perfection, but thy commandments are exceeding broad." We are
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.080]   reminded at the very beginning that what matters above everything else in this world of ours
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:48.120]   is what God has done, what God can still do, what God is going to do. It is the activity
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:56.240]   of Almighty God. Thank God that this is so. Now this is our business. We are not here
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.760]   just a body of men and women amongst others. We are not just one society amongst a great
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:08.640]   variety of societies. That's not the condition of the Church. The Church is here to remind
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:17.160]   the world, to remind everybody of God's activity, God's intervention, God's action
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.360]   in the affairs of man.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:27.120]   But then I must go on to make a second point which is very obvious in this story, which
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:35.800]   is, of course, that the record, the history that we have in the Bible is the history of
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:49.520]   God's acts or actions of redemption, of deliverance, and of salvation. This again is something
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.280]   that we have got to put right in the front. God's acting. Well how does he act? Well
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:19:01.240]   he acts in redemption and in deliverance. Now the story of the children of Israel is,
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:07.280]   of course, actual history. And the children of Israel were God's people. But they are
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:16.560]   a picture, at the same time, of God's relationship to the whole world. And the message of the
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:27.080]   Bible from beginning to end is this great message of God's redemption, God's deliverance.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:33.920]   You see, here it is in the case of the children of Israel. They had gone down to live in Egypt
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:42.560]   because of a famine in their country. And they had settled there. But a time came when
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:49.920]   rulers arose in Israel who didn't remember Joseph, who was himself an Israelite, and
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:55.320]   who had delivered Egypt in a miraculous and marvellous manner as a result of a dream,
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:01.040]   you remember, from famine. All that had been forgotten. And the children of Israel had
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.720]   now become slaves in the land of Egypt. And they were very cruelly treated, abominably
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:12.880]   treated. But they were completely helpless. They couldn't do anything at all about themselves.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:19.840]   But God intervened. God laid his hand, you remember, on Moses in an extraordinary manner,
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:28.160]   even from his very birth. And the people were led out of Egypt in a miraculous manner. But
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:33.400]   then, as we are reminded here, they came to the Red Sea. How could they cross it? Here
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.960]   are the hosts of Pharaoh coming after them with their chariots and their horses. And
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.840]   here are the poor children of Israel with Pharaoh and his hosts behind them and the
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.680]   Red Sea in front of them. It seems calamitous. There's no hope. Suddenly the Red Sea is
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   divided and they went through on dry land. God. And then he led them through the wilderness.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.520]   And there was no food there. There's no food in the wilderness. And God provided the
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.440]   manna for them. You remember the story. And now here they are at the end of the journey
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:09.040]   through the wilderness on the point of crossing the Jordan into Canaan. How are they going
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:16.520]   to cross? Once more God intervenes. And they are delivered and they enter into the promised
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:23.600]   land flowing with milk and honey. Well now, the stones are put up to remind people of
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.720]   that. Well now, in a much bigger way, the function and the purpose of the Christian
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:39.320]   church is to remind people, remind the whole world of these great acts of God in redemption
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:46.080]   and in deliverance. So this is what we are here for. This is what we represent in the
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.720]   world. The church is not a club, not a social club. It's not a club where you can have
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.960]   entertainment. Now the world is full of that kind of thing. All right, let them have it.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.720]   I'm not here of necessity to criticize it. But I am here to say that that's not the business
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.600]   of the church. There is fellowship in the church, but that's not the primary function
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:15.000]   of the church. We are here to remind people of what God has done about us men and our
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.680]   salvation. What does this mean? Well, this is what we've got to spell out today. The
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:30.400]   very existence of this building is a proclamation of the fact that every one of us is born into
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   this world a sinner. We're all captives. We're all slaves. We're all in a state of bondage.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:47.280]   This is the great message of the Bible. It's all due, of course, to men's original rebellion
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:54.720]   against God. The folly of Adam and Eve listening to the tempter, thereby rebelling against
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:01.160]   God. And what they did, of course, was to make slaves of themselves. From that moment,
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:08.400]   they lost their liberty and they became the slaves of the devil. You remember how this
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:16.080]   is put before us in many, many places in the New Testament. The Apostle Paul says, "You
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:24.960]   are the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins." He goes on to say that everybody
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:32.760]   in this world walks according to the course of this world, under the God of this world,
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:40.360]   the Prince of this world, the Spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.480]   We've all had our conversation in that way. We've all lived in that way, says Paul, obeying
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:53.520]   the lusts of the flesh and of the mind. Now that's the condition of the whole of the human
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:59.000]   race and that's why the world is unhappy. And that's why there's so much confusion and
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.960]   trouble in the world. The world is dominated by the devil, the Prince of the power of the
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.960]   devil, and we are the God of this world. And the result is that we are all, by nature,
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:20.680]   slaves to the thing to do, what everybody's doing, and slaves to these lusts and evil
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:28.520]   desires and passions that are within us. Now this is true universally of the whole of the
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:35.400]   human race. And furthermore, it is true to say this, that we are helpless slaves and
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:43.360]   hopeless slaves. We tend to think that that education can set us free, but we've discovered
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:50.880]   that it can't. We've trusted to so many things, but they can't set us free. We are exactly
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.360]   in the position of the children of Israel in the captivity of Egypt. The world is a
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:04.360]   hard taskmaster. The way of the transgressor is hard. There is no peace, says my God, to
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:12.240]   the wicked. That's the story of the human race, isn't it? Inbunded, slaves in captivity.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.600]   And we can't get out. We can't break loose. Why? Well, as our Lord said, the strong man
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.760]   armed, that's the devil, keeping his goods in peace. He'll give us a certain amount of
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:30.720]   apparent liberty, but you try to get out of his grip. You try to get out of that prison
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:36.760]   cell in which he holds you, and he'll club you down. You can't get free. And all the
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:44.480]   striving of men to attain to moral and intellectual and spiritual freedom is a complete failure.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:51.280]   We are seeing this in many ways in the modern world. Well, here is the business of the church,
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:59.960]   to tell men and women that they're in bondage to the God of this world, the way of the world,
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:08.440]   the thing to do, and all the consequent misery and unhappiness to which it leads. And upon
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:14.600]   all of it, there is the wrath of God, because we've rebelled against him.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:23.440]   That's the beginning of our message, but it's only the beginning. Our great message is this,
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:30.640]   that in spite of our folly and in spite of what we are, and our helplessness and hopelessness,
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:39.040]   God has had pity and has had mercy and has had compassion. God has come in. This is the
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:46.120]   whole record of the Bible. As the Apostle Peter, you remember, put it on the Day of
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.320]   Pentecost, indeed as the people, when they came crowding round to see the apostles and
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.960]   others filled with the Spirit, they said, "This is a marvellous thing. We are hearing
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:03.040]   all these people telling us in their own language the wonderful works of God." And that is the
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:08.800]   Bible, the wonderful works of God. What mean these stones? What's the purpose of this building?
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:15.400]   What's the church? It's to tell people of the wonderful works of God. God coming in,
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:21.760]   intervening and delivering men in his utter helplessness and his hopelessness. How has
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:27.040]   he done it? Well, I could keep you, of course, for hours, but let me pick out some of these
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:34.240]   great events that are put before us in the Bible. Take the picture which we have in the
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.600]   third chapter of the book of Genesis. The men and the women have rebelled against God
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   and they have sinned. And the moment they sinned, of course, they realised that they
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:51.200]   had been wrong. They became aware of guilt and they began to be frightened. What would
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:57.120]   have been the rest of the story? Well, it would have been a putrefaction and everything
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:03.960]   would have ended in nothing. But you remember what we are told. Suddenly, the men and the
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:11.640]   women heard the voice of the Lord God who was walking in the garden in the cool of the
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:21.080]   evening. God had come down to them in their misery and their wretchedness and their fear
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:28.960]   as a result of their rebellion and sin. God came to them. God came in. God came down.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:35.320]   God acted. And of course, he pronounced to them the judgment upon their sin, but he didn't
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   leave it at that. He gave them a promise. Having told them that there would be enmity
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.240]   between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman, he said, "The seed of the woman
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:53.520]   shall bruise the serpent head." He's given them a promise. Now there, you see, that's
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.960]   the typical message. That's our message to the world. We are again, the whole world is
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:05.840]   in misery, wretchedness, fear of the present, fear of the future. Thank God we can tell
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:14.760]   them that God is concerned, that God has done something about it, that God has intervened.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:23.920]   Let me hurry on to another great act of God. He acted in judgment in the flood. And let's
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:31.040]   not forget that. God acts in judgment, as we are reminded here, and in deliverance.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:38.240]   And he did act in the flood, but he saved that family. The human race goes on. But still
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.400]   they got into trouble. They lost their heads. They tried to build the Tower of Babel to
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:47.640]   reach up to heaven. They began to think they were gods and that nothing was impossible.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:53.960]   God passed judgment upon that. He confounded it. And there was great trouble. And then
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:30:00.360]   God did an amazing thing. There was a man whose name was Abram. And he lived in a place
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:09.720]   called Ur of the Chaldeans. And he was a pagan. But God spoke for that man. And he told him
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:16.160]   that he was going to take hold of him and turn him into a nation. And that through that
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:24.360]   nation, all the nations of the world were going to have this great message and were
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:32.280]   going to be blessed. One man to be turned into a nation. He commanded him to come out.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.960]   And he came out not knowing where he went. But God had got a purpose for him and took
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:42.480]   him to this land of Canaan, the beginning of the great story of the Jews, the children
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:50.800]   of Israel. Through these people, God spoke to the whole world. This is God's action.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:56.760]   It wasn't that Abram suddenly had an idea that he'd move and start a new life and
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:02.560]   start a dynasty in another land. Not at all. He had no idea it was God who came. And you
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:07.080]   read your Old Testament. My dear friends, the history of the Old Testament is of supreme
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:13.000]   importance for us. We mustn't merely concentrate on the teaching. The history. This is what
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:21.960]   saves us, what God has done. And so he turned these men into a nation. And you remember
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:30.720]   the great story. The time came when this nation again found itself in captivity in the land
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.280]   of Babylon. They were conquered because of their disobedience, because of their folly.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.400]   They were conquered. Their great city of Jerusalem was sacked. They were carried away, captives,
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.640]   to Babylon. And there they were, as they had been in Egypt, completely helpless and hopeless,
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:57.600]   could do nothing at all. God even used a pagan king called Cyrus to set them at liberty again.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:06.240]   And the remnant was led back to its own country. It's God all the time. And then for me to
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:13.040]   hurry on, things had been bad. There had been persecutions and trouble, a kind of dead period
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:18.960]   for 400 years. And you would have thought that everything had come to an end. The period
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.920]   between the last book of the Old Testament, Malachi, and the Gospel of Matthew in the
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:29.760]   New Testament, 400 years of dead, not a move, not a word. And you would have thought everything
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:35.040]   came to an end. Then suddenly you read in the third chapter of the Gospel according
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:40.880]   to St. Luke, it's just a good statement of it, that's why I select that, in the 15th
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:49.280]   year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Herod being the tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:59.040]   his brother, the tetrarch of Iturria, and the region of Trachonitis. What happened?
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:08.320]   The word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. In the midst of the hopelessness
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:15.920]   and the despair, God again acted, spoke to John the Baptist, gave him his message, and
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:22.400]   this forerunner began to preach in a flaming manner, calling people to repentance, saying
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:30.000]   that the Messiah was about to come. And then of course, towering over it all, when the
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:38.720]   fullness of the times had come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.920]   to redeem them that are under the law. The birth of the babe of Bethlehem. You know,
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:49.680]   my friends, it seems to me so sad today that people are always talking about the Christian
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:55.440]   attitude towards war and peace and politics and industry and education, the Christian
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:03.200]   attitude. And people are ignorant of these great facts and events. The Church is here
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:11.360]   to proclaim the birth of a babe in a stable in Bethlehem, and to say that that babe born
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:19.520]   in the stable is the eternal Son of God. God hath visited and redeemed his people. God
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:25.600]   sent forth his Son. It's an act. This isn't a teaching, really. It isn't a philosophy.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:31.760]   It's not a religion. It's what God has done. He has sent his Son into the world. And the
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   Son came, and this is the great fact of history. This is what Christianity is. It's pointing
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:45.280]   back to this. What mean these stones? What's this building? It's a proclamation that 1977
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:52.160]   years ago, the very Son of God was born as a babe in that stable in Bethlehem, and his
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.520]   little body was placed in the manger. What's he come for? Is it merely to teach us? Well,
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:03.440]   he did teach. Is it only that? Is it to give us an example? He did. Is it not? No, no.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:10.480]   Why did he come? The Son of Man, he says, has come to seek and to save that which is
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:17.280]   lost. That's why he's come. He has been led a little lower than the angels for the suffering
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:23.360]   of death. Well, here it is, a great fact. And the important thing about our Lord, I
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:30.000]   say again, is not his teaching, even. Perfect and glorious, though it is. It is that he
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   went deliberately to that cross on Calvary's hill. What happened there? Oh, you see, it's
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.600]   the action of men. It's cruel men, not understanding him, jealous of him, the world always putting
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:52.400]   to death its greatest benefactors. Men crucified him and he died. In a sense, it's true.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:58.440]   But that isn't the real explanation of what happened. They were but the instruments. What
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:07.720]   was happening on the cross? It was God acting. God laid on him the iniquity of us all. He
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:14.480]   is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. God has provided his own Lamb.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:19.560]   All in the Old Testament about burnt offerings and sacrifices, it's pointing forward to him.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:25.600]   Here's the Lamb of God. And God acts. God lays on him. We beheld him smitten, stricken
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:34.320]   of God. It's God who put him to death. Because without shedding of blood, there is no remission
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:40.720]   of sins. My dear friends, this is what the world is ignorant of. There is no way of salvation
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:46.720]   or deliverance apart from this. But it's God who's provided it. God was in and through
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:52.560]   Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. We don't reconcile ourselves unto God. It's
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.840]   God who reconciled us unto himself. That's how he's done it. So you have these great
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:06.600]   facts. And then he died and they put his body in the grave. And then this mighty shattering
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:16.840]   event. God raised him from the dead, bursting asunder the bands of death. The mighty act
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:24.760]   of God in the resurrection. And on you go. Day of Pentecost at Jerusalem. Here we are,
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.600]   members of a Christian church. How did the church ever come into being? The church came
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:38.160]   into being on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem. It was inaugurated then. And it was inaugurated
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.120]   by what? By this amazing event. A hundred and twenty people met together in an upper
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:49.560]   room and they were praying and suddenly there was a sound of a mighty rushing wind. They
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:57.640]   hadn't created this. This is the coming of the Holy Ghost. This other mighty event. God
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:04.520]   acting. God sending his Spirit upon these people, enabling them to preach and to bear
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:09.120]   their witness, giving them understanding and boldness. All you read of in the book
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:15.680]   of the Acts of the Apostles. Acts, remember. It's always actions. Gave them power to work
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:21.760]   miracles and so the church comes into being and starts on a great mission. And what is
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:28.480]   the message? It's all about what God has done and supremely what God has done in and
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:36.560]   through his only begotten Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And you know, my friends,
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:41.760]   it doesn't stop at that. And we mustn't stop at that. That's only the beginning
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:49.720]   of the church. And we know what happened. We know that after a while, the church began
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:57.960]   to go astray. The Roman Emperor called Constantine decided to become a Christian. He decided
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:04.760]   it mainly on political grounds. The Christians were good people. They were helpful people.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:10.280]   And his empire was in trouble. And he realized that these could be the most useful people.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.760]   So he said he became a Christian and he made Christianity the official religion of the
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:21.040]   Roman Empire. He tried to turn it into a religion and he succeeded to a very great extent. And
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:28.600]   Christianity very nearly came to an end. And the story goes on for many centuries. But
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:34.360]   it didn't come to an end. And we are here this morning because it didn't come to an
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:42.760]   end. What prevented it from coming to an end? Oh, the action of God again. God intervening
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:50.760]   in revival and reformation. You see, the whole story of the church is one of the interventions,
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:58.120]   the actions of God. It's the history of God acting. Look at those dark Middle Ages.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:03.920]   Roman Catholicism rampant through the country. People couldn't read the Bible. It was in
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:10.840]   Latin. They couldn't understand it. All the ceremony and the ritual, no gospel. The priesthood,
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:17.160]   the saints, Virgin Mary, and the people in gross ignorance and darkness. Christianity
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:22.960]   virtually had ceased to exist in a true and in a living sense. And you would have imagined
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.400]   that the end had come. Who could stand up against this mighty, wealthy church with twelve
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:34.440]   centuries of tradition behind her? It seemed completely hopeless. But it wasn't. God called
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:41.440]   a man named Martin Luther, opened his eyes, gave him understanding. He was not abler than
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:47.400]   many another men. But this was the man that God chose, the monk that shook the world.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:52.280]   It wasn't the monk who shook, it was God who shook the world through the monk, shook the
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:59.960]   church, purified the church, reformation, a new beginning. And on it has gone. Were
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:06.520]   it not that God keeps on intervening in revival, in coming again in the power of his might,
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.920]   and pouring his Spirit upon the church, the church would have finished long ago. If the
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:17.480]   church were yours and mine, there'd be no church by now. It's in spite of us. God keeps
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:25.960]   his work alive by coming in, raising up men again, and doing his mighty deeds.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:33.040]   Well now, this is the business of the church, you see. To remind people of this, and let
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:39.640]   me go on and elaborate that just a bit by reminding you of the essential character and
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:48.680]   the nature of these acts, these actions of God in history. And it's put before us here
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:57.040]   quite simply. The Lord your God, when you let your children know, saying, Israel came
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:03.400]   over this Jordan on dry land, for the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:09.840]   before you, until you were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:18.400]   he dried up from before us, until we were gone over. What's the nature of God's action?
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:28.360]   It's miraculous. It's supernatural. We are here to proclaim an almighty God. We are here
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:36.840]   to say that Christianity is supernatural. It is a miraculous life. In other words, we
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:41.840]   are not people who merely hold to a certain teaching and try to live a good life. We do
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:48.760]   that. But that's not the great truth about us. The essential truth about us is this,
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:52.960]   that a miracle has happened in us because of God's action.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:59.000]   Now I'm not saying this, the Bible itself says it. You remember the story of a man called
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:10.280]   Nicodemus. He was a great man. He was a teacher, a master in Israel, a very learned man. And
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:18.600]   he'd been watching and listening to our Lord in Jerusalem. He'd seen him working miracles,
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   he'd heard his incomparable teaching, and he was deeply moved and impressed. So he decided
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:34.000]   that he'd go and talk to our Lord and ask him the secret of this extraordinary ability
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.800]   that he had to teach and preach and work miracles. He went at night because he, of course, was
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.280]   a man who'd been highly trained, and he was afraid for his reputation, and afraid what
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:54.280]   other people might think of him, because this Jesus was a carpenter, an unlearned man, hadn't
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:44:00.600]   been through the schools. So he went by night, and do you remember what he said? He said,
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:08.320]   "Rabbi, Master, thou must be a teacher sent from God, for no man can do these miracles
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:14.600]   that thou doest, except God be with him." And then I think he was on the point of putting
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:21.120]   his question, and his question, of course, would have been this. He was going on to say,
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:28.600]   "I am a master in Israel. I know more than the people. But you know, it seems to me you
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:35.800]   know more than I do, and I'd like to have this extra that you've got. What is it? How
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.720]   can I get this extra?" He was never allowed to put his question. Our Lord interrupted
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:49.360]   him and said, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:57.680]   see the kingdom of God." And Nicodemus couldn't understand this. He was a clever man, and
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:05.480]   he said to our Lord rather facetiously, "How can a man be born when he's old? He's an old
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:13.360]   man. Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" Clever, wasn't
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:20.520]   it? And our Lord, as it were, smiled at him. "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:28.240]   man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, but can't even
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:35.240]   see it. That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:40.480]   Spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, 'He must be born again.' The wind bloweth where
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:45.360]   it listeth. Now here is the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:51.680]   it goeth. So is every one that is born of the Spirit." "You're trying to understand
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.560]   this," said our Lord to Nicodemus. "You can't understand it. It's beyond understanding.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.560]   It's a miracle. It's an act of God. It's the Creator who created man at the beginning,
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:07.280]   recreating him, giving him a new start, a new life, a new everything. The Apostle Paul
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:12.960]   teaches exactly the same. "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:19.000]   God, for they are foolishness unto him. Neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.720]   deserved." And this idea that we as Christians can explain exactly to people what our teaching
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:30.360]   is and persuade them and reason them and argue them into it and talk to them about the Christian
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:37.120]   view of art and literature and so on, it's a denial. We preach a miracle. A man can't
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.600]   understand it. It doesn't matter though he may have the greatest brain in the country
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:48.320]   today, it's not enough. It is God alone that can save a man, and he does it by working
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:56.880]   a miracle within. It's not man taking a decision. It's God renewing, regenerating, and putting
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:05.760]   his own life into the man's soul. It is miraculous. It is supernatural. And that is what we've
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:11.120]   got to preach to people. But we are not merely asking them to accept a teaching or to start
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:18.240]   living in a different way. All that's involved. But we are announcing to them that God can
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:25.320]   give them a new start, can create them anew, and make new men and women of them. This is
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:30.200]   the message that's needed by the world today, not exhortation to people. You find some of
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:36.560]   these ecclesiastics issuing a great appeal to the nation because of industrial troubles,
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:42.040]   appealing to the men and women of this country to exercise discipline. They can't do it.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:48.040]   They must be born again. It's no use appealing to people. They are slaves. They've got to
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:53.200]   be set at liberty spiritually, and then you can address an appeal to them.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:48:00.320]   Well now then, this is the character of the actions that God has been taking throughout
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:06.400]   the centuries. Let me try to sum it all up by asking a question, "Well then, what is
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:14.880]   this great message that we have?" And here it's summarized for us. The point is, these
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:24.040]   stones are to say that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord, that
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:32.880]   it is mighty, that you might fear the Lord. You, the children of Israel also, might fear
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:41.040]   the Lord forever. What's our message? What's the meaning of all this history that I've
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:46.880]   recapitulated for you? And incidentally, when you read your Psalms next, notice how the
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:52.600]   Psalmist so often goes over the whole of the history again. Why? Our greatest danger is
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:59.320]   to forget the history and to turn this glorious message into some sort of theory or philosophy
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:04.440]   or teaching. It's the history of the acts of God. We must never lose sight. But this
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:14.680]   is the message that they convey, the power of God, the power of God in judgment. And
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:20.520]   the world needs to be reminded of this. I believe that the judgment of God is abroad
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:27.640]   at the present time, that the state of the world is partly the judgment of God, the wrath
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:37.480]   of God upon the pride and the arrogance and the folly of men. That's what we are witnessing.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:45.720]   These stones, what mean these stones? Well, says Joshua to the people, your children,
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:52.840]   when they're asked the question, must give this answer. The children of Israel were captives
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:58.360]   in the land of Egypt and they were absolutely helpless. But God raised the men called Moses
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:04.240]   and he led them out. And they set out on their journey to escape. And Pharaoh gathered his
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:09.720]   hosts and his chariots and they're after them and they're going to destroy them. And they
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:16.080]   really believed they were going to destroy them. But what happened? It was Pharaoh and
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:23.200]   his hosts and chariots that were destroyed in the Red Sea. The children of Israel went
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.640]   through on dry land. The moment they'd gone through, the sea closed in. And there, Pharaoh
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:38.200]   and his hosts drowned in the depths of the Red Sea. The judgment of God. And we are here
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:48.120]   to tell men and women that God is and that they're all under judgment. Whether they experience
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:54.960]   it in its height in this world, they're all going to experience it when they come to die.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.920]   We are to tell men and women that they're responsible to God and they'll have to give
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:10.560]   an account of the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad. So, we proclaim judgment.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:20.200]   But we don't stop at that. This power of God reminds us also that we are to tell people
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:28.520]   that there is hope for everybody. Salvation, thank God, doesn't depend upon our power.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:35.120]   I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, says Paul, why it is the power of God and
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:42.880]   to salvation to everyone that believeth. He's a God of the miracle, the God of the supernatural.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:49.560]   There is nobody hopeless. The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:58.440]   "And here am I, as vile as may I, as vile as he, wash all my sins away." Nobody is
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:06.520]   hopeless. Why? Because God can regenerate. We can't understand, God can give us understanding.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:12.720]   We can't reform ourselves, God can make us new men so that we can say, "Oh, how I
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:20.880]   love thy law, the power of God." And isn't it marvelous? You've got the problem of alcoholism
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.040]   and of drug addiction here, haven't you, in Crewe, as it's in all the cities of this
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:32.200]   country at the present time. The problem of immorality, infidelity and divorce, promiscuity,
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:38.440]   all these things. I remember once changing trains here in Crewe Station and having a
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:44.440]   cup of coffee and overhearing a conversation between two potters and a woman. And what
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:51.680]   they were talking about was the horrible number of cases of venereal disease in the local
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:58.880]   hospital. That was the topic of their conversation. That's the world. But you see, this is the
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:08.480]   glory of the gospel. There is hope for anybody. There's hope for everybody. Because it doesn't
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:15.000]   depend upon us, but upon God, the power of God, that all the people of the earth might
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:23.560]   know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty. There is power, power, wonder-working power
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:30.920]   in the precious blood of the Lamb. The Holy Ghost can convict the stoutest sinner. He
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:38.640]   can regenerate him. No one is hopeless because it is the power of God and not the power of
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:46.760]   the understanding of men. And finally, and this is such a glorious hope for the Church.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:52.160]   I have been reminding you of the history. And I've been showing you how so often in
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:57.400]   the long course of the history of the Church, the Church seems to be trembling on the brink
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:06.440]   of the grave, finished, everything against her. But God always came in and it's still
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:16.600]   the same. God is still the same. His all-mightiness is in no sense diminished. People are talking
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:23.560]   about communism and materialism and humanism and all that's so against the Church today,
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:28.640]   taking the people away on Sunday's television, wireless bingo. Oh, they say, "What's going
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.600]   to happen to the Church?" I'll tell you what's going to happen to the Church. The Church
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:41.040]   is going on until God's plan is perfect and complete, until the fullness of the Gentiles
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:49.160]   and all Israel shall be saved. God's work and plan is complete and entire. And there
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:55.800]   will be a final judgment upon all evil and sin and wrong, and the devil himself will
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:07.960]   be cast into the lake of perdition. But the hand of the Lord is mighty. It's all-mighty.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:19.840]   No one can make him his purpose for go or sever my soul from his love. My dear friends,
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:27.160]   your privilege and mine is to announce this, to proclaim this. People ask, "What mean
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:32.280]   these stones? What are you Christians? What is the Church? What does it all mean? What
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:40.000]   do we got to say?" That's what we've got to say. We tell them about God and his mighty
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:48.040]   acts and supremely his mighty act in sending his only begotten, dearly beloved Son into
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:57.480]   the world to live, to die, to rise again, to reign and to come in glory for us and our
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:03.280]   salvation. Let us pray.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:11.360]   O Lord our God, we humbly beseech thee to give us a new awareness and consciousness
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:20.240]   of the glory of our heritage, the truth which we represent. Lord, open our eyes and send
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:28.480]   thy mighty power upon us. God of our fathers, be our God. Let it be known that thou art
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:36.360]   still God in Israel and that with thee nothing shall be impossible. Hear us, O Lord, and
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:43.040]   magnify and glorify thy known name amongst us and especially amongst thy dear people
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:49.040]   that meet here regularly. And unto thee shall we give all the praise and all the honor and
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:57:01.200]   all the glory of now and forever. Amen.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:07.040]   Now shall we join in singing our closing hymn, hymn number 264.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:17.040]   "Thy hand, O God, has guided thy flock from age to age. The wondrous tale is written full
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:22.040]   clear on every page." 264.
