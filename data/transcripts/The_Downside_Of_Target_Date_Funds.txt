[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about target
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.640]   date funds.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.040]   So what's a target date fund?
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.860]   First of all, it's known as a life cycle or dynamic risk or age based fund.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.040]   It's often a mutual fund designed to provide a simple investment solution through a portfolio
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.240]   whose asset allocation mix becomes more conservative as the target date approaches.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.600]   So the target date is usually retirement, but it can be any upcoming expense such as
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.440]   college tuition.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.440]   And that's what I did.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.840]   I invested in two target date funds, one for my son and one for my daughter when they were
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.840]   born.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.680]   So after four and a half years of investing in target date funds, I finally done a deep
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.380]   dive analysis.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.360]   And I did this deep dive analysis because the performance of these target date funds
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.280]   has been irking me for the past couple of years, at least since early 2020.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.440]   So let me share why investing in target date funds in a 529 plan or retirement plan may
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.240]   not be the optimal move.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.480]   So let's discuss.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.400]   In a bull market, investing in a target date fund is a suboptimal move.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400]   Why?
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.440]   Because a target date fund is a mixture of equities and fixed income.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.440]   So if you compare that to an S&P 500 index in a bull market, obviously the target date
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.360]   fund is likely going to underperform because its bond weighting will not increase as much
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.080]   as its equity weighting.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.080]   So that's one.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.880]   I made the mistake of investing in a target date fund in 2017.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.480]   But in hindsight, I do see why I did it.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.560]   And it's because I thought things were kind of frothy back in 2017.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:56.320]   We've had every year since 2009, a bull market up 26% in 2009, 15% in 2010, 2% in 2011, 16%
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.800]   in 2012.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.200]   And it kept on going.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.760]   In 2017, the market or the S&P 500 closed up almost 22%.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:12.640]   So when I was thinking about funding the 529 plan, I was thinking, man, super funding $75,000
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.720]   felt like a lot.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.240]   So I didn't initially, but I ended up doing so throughout a five month period from about
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.640]   the middle of 2017 until the end of the year.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.480]   And my wife decided to fund $15,000 that year.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.380]   And then the plan was to fund $15,000 a year.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.120]   But by 2018, the market actually declined.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.880]   So she super funded as well.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:46.160]   But the thing is, we didn't adjust after the 2018 decline, because in 2019, and 2020 and
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.680]   21, the S&P 500 has been on a tear, right?
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.520]   31% in 2019, 18.4% in 2020, and over 25% so far in 2021.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.860]   So in a bull market, investing in a target date fund is a real disappointment.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.240]   And our fund in our son's fund in particular, which I write about has underperformed tremendously.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.440]   For example, year to date through October, it was only up 10.85%.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.360]   Whereas year to date through October, the S&P 500 was up 24%.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.520]   So that's almost a 13.2% underperformance.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.680]   Now of course, I expected a target date fund to underperform purely an S&P 500 index, and
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.120]   more apples to apples comparison would be to compare it to a blended fund, right?
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.360]   Like a 70/30 fund, which is what the target date fund actually is 70% equity 30% fixed
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   income.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.000]   However, I really didn't expect such a massive 14% underperformance.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.960]   I mean, that's huge, especially if you have larger and larger amounts of money.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.400]   Okay, besides underperforming during a bull market.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.320]   The other downside to target date funds are the fees.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.240]   Now I didn't really realize this until I called up Fidelity, but there are at least they offer
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.520]   two types of target date funds for your 529 plan.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.800]   One is like, they call it the Freedom Fund, which is an actively run target date fund
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.520]   with an expense ratio of 0.87%.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.240]   And then they have the Fidelity index target date funds, which are passively index managed
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.600]   funds with an expense ratio of only 0.14%.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:42.120]   Now 0.14% is obviously way better than paying 0.87%, especially if the actively run target
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.640]   date fund underperforms.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.040]   And this is what I actually thought I bought for my son.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.540]   You know, back in 2017, I remember now, Fidelity rep saying, hey, we've got actively run funds
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.600]   and index funds.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.860]   What would you like?
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.080]   And I think, and I thought I had invested in an actively run fund with the assumption
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.880]   that the fees were the same.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.620]   So before you invest in any of these target date funds, please differentiate between actively
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:19.380]   run with a higher fee and passively indexed target date funds with a much lower fee.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.080]   We know from history that actively run funds underperform over a 10 year period, something
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.560]   like 80% of equity managers underperform over a 10 year period.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.540]   So those are bad odds.
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.120]   And then to boot, if you are going to pay a higher fee, you just compound those bad
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.120]   returns.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.120]   Just think about this scenario.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.600]   Let's say your 529 plan grows to $500,000 by the time your child turns 18.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:54.680]   $500,000 times 0.87% is $4,350 a year in annual fees.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.760]   Instead, if you were able to just construct your own two to three fund portfolio with
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:07.680]   ETFs, you'd pay like a 0.09% fee because that's what Vanguard total stock market ETF has as
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.680]   an expense ratio.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.000]   And that would be $450 a year, which is not bad at all.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.640]   So this fee is very high.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.900]   It's a pretty big drag.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.580]   And it's one of the reasons why these target date funds have been created.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.740]   These actively run target date funds have been created.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.000]   They're great moneymakers.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.160]   Over time, target fund creators make more money from their clients as balances grow.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.160]   Meanwhile, the fund managers don't have to generate any alpha for charging high fees.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.960]   Instead, the clients are okay with declining returns, making it even easier for the fund
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.600]   manager to do their jobs.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   Think about it.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.400]   What kind of system where you have clients who are willing to pay you more and accept
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.000]   lower returns?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.600]   I mean, that is a great business.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.080]   So instead of investing in target date funds, you might want to invest in the firms that
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.760]   create the target date funds or better yet, you want to go and work for those firms and
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.120]   manage target date funds because the weightings are all preset.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.920]   I mean, you don't need to have any kind of investing acumen.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.600]   You just need to follow a set glide path to the target date.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.680]   Now it may seem that I'm very against target date funds due to higher fees and underperformance.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.920]   However, if the S&P 500 decided to continue to go down after 2018, I'd probably be singing
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.000]   a much lighter tune because the target date funds would have outperformed the S&P 500
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.760]   index because the fixed income portion would have done better.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.560]   So who should invest in target date funds?
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.440]   Well, I think there are four types of people.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.520]   First, first time parents who want to get their 529 plan investing out of the way.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.600]   That was us in 2017 when our son was born.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.880]   I was in full on dad protection mode.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.440]   I wanted to preserve our capital and I wanted to focus on being a good parent.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.200]   I remember selling our Honda Fit and buying a larger SUV.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.240]   I remember selling our rental property so I could simplify life and get back more time
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.160]   to be a good father.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.600]   And I was just more conservative because I didn't want to lose any of the capital that
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.080]   I had just accumulated over the years because I had someone depending on me.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.120]   Who else should invest in target date funds?
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.400]   Well, people who have no interest in staying on top of their investments every quarter,
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.880]   every six months, or every year.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.640]   They've got better things to do.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   And I get it.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.320]   I actually don't want to stay on top of my investments all this time because there's
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.200]   just so many other things I'd rather do.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.440]   And being an active investor is a really suboptimal use of time unless this is what you do as
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.760]   a profession.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:58.040]   Three, busy professionals working in an industry other than finance and who have little knowledge
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.760]   about investing.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.680]   Target date funds, probably a really simple and easy way to go.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.480]   And then four, investors okay with frequently not beating the S&P 500 index in exchange
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.120]   for less volatility and more peace of mind.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:19.600]   Again, if you do invest in a target date fund, invest in an index target date fund with lower
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600]   fees.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.080]   Make sure you read the prospectus and you know what the expense ratio is because if
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.080]   you're paying close to a 1% expense ratio, it really is a drag, especially if returns
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.280]   are going to come down in the future.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.360]   We already see Vanguard, Goldman, Bank of America, all of these investment houses are
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.860]   predicted much lower returns in the future for stocks and bonds and even inflation.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:52.420]   So that means that any fee is actually a much greater percentage of the overall return drag.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:58.260]   I hope my post and this episode helps you think about what you're investing in and go
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.320]   through what you have been investing in.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   You know, the set it and forget it mentality is pretty good because it forces you or doesn't
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.640]   force you, it just keeps you investing for the long term.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.280]   But from a money management perspective, setting it and forgetting it is actually music to
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.640]   their ears, especially if you're paying higher fees.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.000]   What happens is life gets in the way.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.500]   I invested in these funds in 2017 and in 2019 and I've just been busy doing other things
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.840]   and I don't want to think about these target date funds because that's why I invested in
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.240]   them so they can do what they're supposed to be doing.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.440]   But I wasn't aware about the fee structure and I wasn't aware that 30% of the funds were
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.080]   in international equities, which I'm not a fan of or I haven't been a fan of for the
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.000]   past several years because the US has been so strong and there's so much opportunity
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.480]   and I haven't been investing that way in my other funds.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.600]   So investing in these target date funds, I carved out a niche so that that money can
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:04.120]   be handled, but it's actually not aligned to my personal investing philosophy on the
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.100]   other funds that I manage.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.640]   So you want to make sure that if you invest in these target date funds, it's aligned with
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.780]   your investing philosophy at the moment.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:19.420]   If you don't want to invest in a target date fund, you can invest in a digital wealth advisor.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.680]   Those guys, they charge relatively low fees and they build your portfolio based on your
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.240]   risk tolerance and it's another low cost way to go.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.000]   There are definitely good solutions.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.360]   I just wouldn't put a majority of your capital in actively run funds and actively run target
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.840]   date funds.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.320]   Just the performance tends to be disappointing.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.360]   It would be one thing if the expense ratio was the same, but they are not.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:51.080]   Actively run funds tend to unperform and they charge more and the more money you have, the
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.520]   more money they take and it's just not a good feeling to pay more for underperformance.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.800]   I will leave you with this one piece of good news.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.520]   It's actually just for me and that is I called Fidelity and I asked them because I wanted
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   to rebalance what I thought was my actively run target date fund into an index fund and
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.880]   they actually said, "You're already in an index fund."
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:18.040]   So I am paying the 0.14% expense ratio and not the 0.87% expense ratio that I thought.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.760]   I'm just severely underperforming the S&P 500 index, which is a shame since our son
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.320]   still has 14 years left until he turns 18 and he can afford to take more risk.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.280]   All right, everybody, even though I have missed out on probably 30,000 plus in lost profits
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.240]   by investing in target date funds, it's better than not investing at all.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.560]   So if you have any questions or comments about target date funds, I'd love to hear them in
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.760]   the comments in the post and I'll see you guys around.
