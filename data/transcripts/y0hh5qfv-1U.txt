[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   If you've ever heard that exercise can give you energy,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   this is the basis of that statement, right?
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.880]   Many people, in fact, myself for many years thought,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.840]   okay, I definitely have to sleep well
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.520]   in order to have energy and focus.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.360]   That's absolutely true, still true, will always be true.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.680]   I should maybe have some caffeine, be hydrated,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.440]   you know, well-nourished, all this stuff
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.220]   in order to have the energy to exercise.
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.400]   But it's also true that exercise gives us energy
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.520]   and this is how it gives us energy.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.920]   When we move our body, the adrenals release adrenaline
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.320]   and the adrenaline acts through two different
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.140]   so-called parallel pathways within the body.
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.180]   But again, it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier.
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.800]   So then there's a series of what we call signaling relays
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.920]   or circuit relays up to the locus coeruleus
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.360]   and then a sort of analog, it's different,
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.000]   but an analog to epinephrine, norepinephrine
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.360]   is released within the brain.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.240]   And lo and behold, we have elevated levels
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.880]   of both bodily energy and brain energy and focus
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.640]   that we can devote to that exercise,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.300]   but also to the learning that comes after that exercise.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.840]   So the next time you're feeling a little tired
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.780]   and you don't want to work out,
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.160]   remember, exercise gives you energy
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.500]   through the pathways that I just described.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.360]   Now, anytime I talk about the adrenals,
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.480]   people start talking about adrenal burnout.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.920]   They say, oh, you burn out your adrenals.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.200]   You know, there are these crazy theories
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.360]   that you'll hear out there.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.320]   You know, coffee burns out your adrenals, not true.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.360]   You'll hear that if you exercise too much,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.800]   it might burn out your energy or your adrenals.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.200]   Look, you have enough capacity within your adrenals
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.400]   to survive relatively long famines,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.440]   to survive long bouts of challenge,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.240]   stress of many, many different kinds,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.080]   short challenges, and so on.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.260]   You're not gonna burn out your adrenals.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.040]   There is something called adrenal insufficiency syndrome,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.960]   which is a real syndrome.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.360]   There are diseases of the adrenals,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.340]   but that's not what we're referring to here.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.800]   You have plenty of adrenaline in your adrenals
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.900]   that you can deploy through movement, through exercise,
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.820]   to get the elevation and arousal attention and so forth
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.200]   that we've been talking about.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   In fact, there's a set of biological pathways
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.080]   that were just recently discovered
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.600]   that will allow you to understand how to use movement
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.760]   in order to engage your adrenals
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.720]   so that then those adrenals can release adrenaline,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.200]   impact your vagus, impact the organs of your body,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   the locus coeruleus,
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.820]   and elevate your levels of attention and focus.
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.520]   And a lot of the core components of these pathways
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.080]   are highlighted in a paper that I absolutely love,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.200]   another paper I absolutely love.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.640]   This is from Peter Strick's Laboratory
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.000]   at University of Pittsburgh,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.100]   which is entitled "The Mind-Body Problem,
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.180]   Circuits that Link the Cerebral Cortex
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.220]   to the Adrenal Medulla."
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.380]   What they discovered is that there are essentially
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.760]   three categories of brain areas,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.740]   all of which communicate with the adrenals
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.100]   and can cause them to release adrenaline
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.860]   to create this elevation and arousal and attention.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.580]   Those three brain areas include areas of the brain
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.500]   that are involved in thinking, what we call cognition,
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.460]   areas of the brain that are related
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.100]   to what are called affective states,
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.300]   which is just kind of a more general category
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.740]   that includes emotions.
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.920]   Okay, if you saw the Huberman Lab podcast episode
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.780]   that I did with Lisa Feldman Barrett,
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.140]   she explains beautifully the distinction
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.300]   between affective states and emotions,
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.420]   but these are brain areas that basically relate
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.380]   to what we are feeling or how we're perceiving
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.300]   our environment and how we're reacting to it,
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.220]   these sorts of things.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.100]   And then there's a third category of brain areas
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.060]   that most robustly communicates with the adrenals.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.220]   And these are a collection of brain areas
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.540]   that are all involved with movement
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.060]   of particular areas of our body.
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.800]   These areas are broadly referred to as the motor network.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.180]   So these are areas of the so-called cerebral cortex,
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.260]   which are on the outer portion of the brain.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.660]   And they send these wires down the spinal cord.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.980]   There's a little relay in the spinal cord,
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.480]   it's called the IML.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.900]   If you're interested in the anatomical details,
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.300]   I'll put the link to this paper in the show note captions.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.780]   In any case, these brain areas that are involved
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.780]   in motor movement, send axons, those wires,
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.280]   down to the spinal cord.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.300]   Then from the spinal cord, they send a relay out
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.980]   via what's called the cholinergic preganglionic neurons.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.320]   Basically what ends up happening is that acetylcholine,
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.700]   which is a neuromodulator, is released from these neurons
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.800]   that originate in the spinal cord onto the adrenal medulla.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.100]   And then the adrenal medulla, the so-called adrenals,
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.500]   same thing, adrenal medulla, adrenals, releases adrenaline.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.740]   That creates these effects in the body, on the heart,
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.140]   the muscles and other tissues.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.620]   And then as described before,
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.360]   that adrenaline also acts on the vagus,
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.340]   the vagus up to the NST, the locus coeruleus,
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.600]   and we have this elevation and alertness.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.540]   So this paper and papers that came subsequent to it
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.900]   really explain how it is that the movement of our body,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.880]   AKA exercise, allows us to have this elevation
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.660]   in arousal and alertness.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.960]   It's a loop, okay?
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.660]   The adrenals release adrenaline.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.360]   They do these things by these two parallel pathways
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.580]   I've been talking about.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.380]   But your decision to engage these motor areas,
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.740]   to move particular areas of your body,
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.900]   is what deploys that adrenaline.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.300]   Now you might be thinking, well, duh, okay?
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.980]   When I exercise, there's adrenaline release.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.140]   In order to exercise, I need to move my body.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.900]   And these brain areas control the movement of my body.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.380]   But it's not a duh.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.100]   It's actually very profound because it turns out
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.400]   that the specific brain areas
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.740]   that best activate the adrenals
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.820]   are the brain areas that control
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.100]   the muscles closest to the midline,
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.740]   the core musculature,
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.160]   and the brain areas that are involved
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.740]   in generating the sorts of movements
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.900]   that we would call compound movements,
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.060]   at least in the context of resistance training,
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.000]   or that are responsible for moving multiple joints
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.540]   at the same time.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.420]   So what this means in the practical sense
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.540]   is if you are feeling sluggish, you want energy,
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.820]   or you're simply exercising,
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.740]   both for bodily effects and for brain effects,
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.380]   you need the deployment of adrenaline, of epinephrine.
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.300]   You need the deployment of norepinephrine in the brain.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.360]   And by the way, anytime you have a deployment
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.900]   of norepinephrine in the brain,
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.700]   almost always there's a coordinated action
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.300]   of release of dopamine,
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.940]   which most people have heard of by now.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.540]   Dopamine is involved in motivation
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.500]   as well as movement, et cetera.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.400]   So the simple takeaway here is
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.600]   if you want to get the arousal that comes from exercise
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.260]   in order to use that arousal,
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.580]   to leverage it towards better cognition,
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.220]   brain health, et cetera,
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.700]   the key thing is to make sure
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.100]   that you're doing exercises that are compound exercises.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.800]   So these would be the movements.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.960]   You can look these up, just say compound exercises.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.800]   You can put that anywhere,
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.380]   and you'll see that that includes things like squats,
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.180]   deadlifts, bench presses, dips, pull-ups, rows.
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.980]   And yes, of course, you want to train your whole body
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.620]   so that you have symmetry of a function of strength,
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.060]   and you want to offset any injuries
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.880]   and things of that sort, or aesthetic reasons, perhaps.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.860]   But the idea here is if you want energy from exercise,
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.580]   you want focus, you need the deployment
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.220]   of the neurochemicals that we've been discussing,
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.660]   most notably epinephrine and norepinephrine.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.160]   And through the identification of this motor network,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.460]   as well as the affective and cognitive networks
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.900]   that converge on this area of the spinal cord
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.800]   and then send communication to the adrenal medulla,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.440]   you can essentially control the levels of arousal
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.160]   that your body and brain produces.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.300]   So in describing this,
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.380]   my hope is that you'll no longer think about exercise
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.100]   as just elevating your heart rate,
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.780]   or you no longer think about exercise
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.860]   just as moving your body,
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.640]   but rather that the movement of your body
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.780]   is creating specific neurochemical outcomes,
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.020]   both in the body and the brain that create the arousal
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.140]   that initiates the improvements in focus and attention
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.660]   that allow you to learn better,
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.720]   and that contribute generally to brain health and longevity.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   And by the way, for those of you that are interested
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.780]   in things like psychosomatic disorders,
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.900]   trauma, and how trauma can, quote-unquote,
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.380]   be stored in the body,
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.620]   not so much stored in the body,
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.020]   but how it can impact the body,
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.660]   and then how the body itself can impact the brain,
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.400]   this paper has also been used as support for the idea
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.660]   that indeed those affective areas, those emotional areas,
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.960]   those cognitive areas have a route
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.700]   by which they can communicate with the adrenal medulla
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.220]   to cause the release of adrenaline
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.860]   when we have specific thoughts.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.740]   It was always known that if we have specific thoughts,
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.180]   it can, quote-unquote, stress us out,
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.900]   our heart rate can go up, et cetera.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.680]   This paper also provides a reasonable anatomical substrate
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.020]   for that phenomenon.
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.220]   You know, I never want to make too much
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.620]   of any one single paper or finding,
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.780]   but I will say that after I read that paper
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.940]   from Strick and colleagues,
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.900]   and through some of the subsequent discussions
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.860]   about that paper that I overheard at meetings and so forth,
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.100]   it really made me think differently about exercise.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.940]   And now, anytime that I'm feeling tired,
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.600]   provided that I'm not chronically sleep-deprived
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.000]   or something of that sort,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.900]   I remind myself that if I start moving my body,
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.020]   in particular, if I engage core muscles,
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.580]   that was one of the key findings in that paper,
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.860]   that the areas of the brain that control the core muscles,
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.660]   as well as do compound movements,
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.980]   I move multiple joints, I start, you know,
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.020]   warming up in a way that includes some, you know,
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.380]   maybe even just air squats or some running in place
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.740]   or jumping jacks, things of that sort,
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.020]   that the increase in energy that I'm perceiving is real.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.620]   It's based on the same neurochemical outputs
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.540]   that would occur had I gone into the gym
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.660]   or to the run or whatever workout with tons of energy,
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.740]   it would just have increased
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.500]   the level of adrenaline further.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.180]   So this idea that we can actually control our body
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.460]   with our mind, and to some extent, our mind with our body,
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.180]   that's absolutely true.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.100]   And this is one of the tools
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.100]   that I find particularly useful
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.740]   anytime I want to overcome that wall of kind of resistance
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.420]   to not doing the physical exercise
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.360]   that I know I and basically all of us should be doing.

[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.340]   [upbeat music]
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.200]   (upbeat music)
