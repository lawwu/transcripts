[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.160]   Oh my, all right, what do we got here?
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.260]   Allie has a question.
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.200]   Why are norms regarding maintaining email threads
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.120]   not widespread?
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.240]   And then she goes on about like a very big frustration
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.480]   about email should be in one topic per thread
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.400]   and people at my company don't do it, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.900]   I'm gonna skip those details.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.040]   I'm gonna skip those details to get to the bigger point here
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.200]   which is a point that I really learned working on my book,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.600]   A World Without Email,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.860]   norms are not gonna save you from email problems.
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.360]   When I was working on that book and I would go give talks
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.920]   and I talked to executives or C-suites,
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.400]   I do this occasionally where I go talk
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.920]   to a small group of executives.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.080]   They were so sure that email was the key
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.600]   to a productivity nirvana
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.800]   and the only thing holding them back was norms.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.240]   We could just get some better norms
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.680]   about what should be in the subject line,
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.480]   how long you should expect for a response,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.760]   what's appropriate in a thread or not a thread,
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.040]   CC versus BCC, then we would be in productivity nirvana.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.680]   And the reality is that is not gonna solve the problems,
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.620]   norms is not gonna solve the problems.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.720]   The problem is that if your primary mode of collaboration
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.280]   is through ad hoc back and forth digital messaging,
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.840]   you are gonna have a large number of messages
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.360]   arriving at unscheduled times
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.760]   that require relatively prompt responses from you
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.400]   to keep the wheels of your business rolling
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.240]   and that's gonna require
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.960]   that you send and receive emails all the time.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.400]   And there is no norms that are gonna save you from that
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.440]   if that's the way that your business is organized.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.880]   If this underlying what I call hyperactive
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.600]   hive mind workflow is implicitly how work gets done,
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.480]   there's nothing you can tell me
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.080]   about response time expectations,
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.820]   there's nothing you can do with subject line edits,
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.440]   there's nothing you can do about what goes into a thread
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.920]   and what doesn't that will prevent me
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.520]   from needing to check this inbox
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.280]   or this instant messenger channel again and again and again
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.040]   because there's unscheduled messages coming in
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.720]   that I have to reply to quickly
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.460]   to keep the wheels of business rolling.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.140]   So this is a distraction.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.840]   Again, this is you're on the Titanic deck
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.280]   and you're really upset that the people looking
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.000]   for lifeboats are messing up the deck chairs.
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.740]   You can get those deck chairs really nice.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.700]   You can move them in a way
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.580]   so people can move around on the deck really well
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.500]   but your problem is there's not nearly enough lifeboats.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.100]   That is the issue with trying to tackle
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.060]   email overload issues from the top down.
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.180]   So what do you have to do instead?
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.740]   Well, you read my book "A World Without Email"
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.300]   and what that will teach you is that you have to actually
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.340]   fix the underlying systems for how you collaborate.
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.220]   Instead of just allowing back and forth,
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.460]   let's just rock and roll on email be your solution,
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.620]   you have to put in bespoke explicit alternatives,
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.200]   systems for each of the different types of work you do.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.480]   Here's where the information comes in,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.920]   here's when and how we talk about it,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.940]   here's where we store things,
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.480]   here's the process for getting this done.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.360]   And you have to do that again and again and again
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.020]   for all the things you do regularly as a business.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.360]   That's how you fix the hole that the iceberg made
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.600]   in the ship and stop it from sinking in the first place.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.060]   It's processes and systems, not norms.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
