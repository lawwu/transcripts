[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   Hi, I'm here with Scott Scott. Can you introduce yourself? Yeah, my name is Scott Rockhold. I'm from Cheyenne, Wyoming
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.960]   I'm I work in them as a music guy at Yellowstone Baptist Church in Cheyenne
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.120]   Okay, and you've been reading through the LSB. Can you tell us a little bit about your experience?
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.000]   yeah, my wife got me actually the very first copy of the Psalms and I believe is the Psalms and Proverbs and
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.360]   What I really like about it is just I like the effort of really trying to bring it back to
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.060]   The original text as close as possible. I've always studied the NASB
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.640]   Through college and through my biblical studies through college and I just it was nice to see that it's really
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.880]   Taking that tone and I really like the way that that that it's put together
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.760]   And it just it felt like it was home to me. It just really felt like it was comfortable and
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.480]   I don't know. I like anytime I can I can feel like
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.200]   Maybe I'm reading something that's smarter than smarter than I am which is most things
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.240]   But when you're reading something like that, you really feel like you're you've you've seen the effort that the men that that worked on it
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.680]   so hard
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.640]   really had
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.800]   Just put a lot of passion and effort into that really trying to keep it as as as accurate as they could
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.460]   Hey, thanks for joining us tonight. Thank you
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.600]   >> All right.
