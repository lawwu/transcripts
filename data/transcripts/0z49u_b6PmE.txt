[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.520]   - Welcome to Portfolio Rescue, our new show here at The Compound. I'm your host, Ben Carlson.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.880]   This is the show where we're going to be answering questions directly from you, the viewer, every
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.200]   week. We're going to be here live Thursdays. Just a little background on why we started this show.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.880]   When you produce content for a living and you build up an audience, eventually you're bound
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.200]   to get some feedback. That's the best and worst part about the internet. Sometimes it's positive,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.720]   sometimes it's negative, but because we produce financial content, we also receive a ton of
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.960]   questions asking us for our opinions. There's really no handbooks for this stuff when it comes
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.960]   to your finances, so each week our inboxes are full of questions from people who listen to our
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.000]   podcasts or watch these videos or read our blogs, and sometimes these emails from people make us
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.080]   laugh, sometimes they make us cringe, sometimes they make us think, sometimes they help us learn.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.240]   One of the really cool parts is that people place their trust in us, and they share this
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.920]   very detailed information with us. How much money they make, how much they have saved,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.520]   what kind of stock options they have at work, their retirement plan, their investment strategies,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.760]   the financial problems they're having, all this kind of stuff. We've come to realize,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.760]   "Hey, wait a minute. Maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes."
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.840]   Because you can look at these questions and go, "Wait, how would I handle that situation?" Or,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.720]   "I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing?" Or,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.960]   "What if something like this happens to me?" Or, "What is this person thinking? How could
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.440]   they be so stupid?" We don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.560]   there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.440]   with your finances. I want to get this out of the way, too, that this show is for informational
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.640]   purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say,
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.880]   and the legalese, but we've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.840]   context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.440]   people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.960]   into play when making these decisions. That's what the show is going to be. Each week,
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.720]   I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us. Askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.640]   Now, real quick on some of the format of the show before we get started here.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.440]   We get a wide range of questions. Everything from personal finance, to taxes, to investing,
