[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   I totally get the use of an accelerometer, whatever in a watch or in a band that you
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.080]   wear on your wrist for a workout.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.400]   And I think that that's valuable.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.960]   All of that stuff makes super sense for you as an individual.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.120]   But that's not an experience where you're engaging with it to replace some other social
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.120]   interaction.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.860]   That's just you getting utility as you live your life.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.560]   What I'm saying is the idea that you start to rely on a device as your interface into
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.800]   the world, I would take the exact other side of the bat, which is I think that humans are
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.440]   getting so sick and tired of only communicating in these very rigid ways.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.980]   If you look at our children's generation, they don't know how to make eye contact, they
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.980]   don't know how to talk.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.380]   And I think it's going to come back and bite them in the ass.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.720]   And so I think the pendulum is going to swing in the other direction where it's like, OK,
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.920]   enough of this stuff.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.180]   Let's actually look each other in the eye and talk to each other the way that humans
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.180]   were meant to be.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.480]   And I think that in that devices like a glucose monitor or a band has value.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.180]   But I don't think it's going to be this interface where you're sign languaging it while you're
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.180]   at Coachella. I think you're going to rip the devices off and actually be at Coachella without
