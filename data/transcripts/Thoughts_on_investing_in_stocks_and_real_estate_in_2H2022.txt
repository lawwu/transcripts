[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.200]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.040]   And in this short episode, I want to share my thoughts on investing in stocks and in
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.820]   real estate for 2022.
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.380]   So mid-June 2022, we are finally seeing expectations for Fed rate cuts.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.780]   Fed rate cuts, all the Fed has been talking about is trying to stem inflation by hiking.
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.480]   They hiked by 75 basis points recently.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.920]   Expectations are for another 75 basis points in July and maybe 50 basis points going forward
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.320]   to maybe 3.5% when it's all said and done.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.480]   However, finally, mid-June, the expectations for Fed rate cuts are coming starting in 2023.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.480]   Now why is that?
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.240]   Well, we saw the biggest drop in 10 years in the June US Purchasing Managers Index,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.640]   the PMI.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.080]   And also finally, we saw a decline in oil prices in mid-June.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.000]   Now a lot of people have argued that raising the Fed funds rate isn't going to do anything
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.760]   to stem oil prices, right?
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.560]   Ukraine, Russia, there's a problem there.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.880]   So that's causing supply issues.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.880]   And that's really true.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.920]   The Fed funds rate isn't going to curtail oil prices, but it could create massive economic
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.200]   destruction, which will create demand destruction for oil and cause prices to go down.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.000]   So the key is for the Fed not to raise too aggressively as it's seeing the market do
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.480]   its job for them.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.600]   And personally, I think the Fed isn't going to be able to go through with their Fed rate
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.200]   hike plans because things are selling off, demand is getting destroyed, oil prices are
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.960]   finally weakening, and I think it's only a matter of time before there are clear signs
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.080]   that inflation is peaking.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.600]   Once the July data comes out in August 2022, I think it's going to be pretty clear that
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.200]   inflation has peaked.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.480]   And we might even get positive June inflation data out in July.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.240]   If this is the case, 3.5% was likely the peak for the 10-year bond yield.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.600]   And with less fear of a further rise in interest rates, risk appetite should increase, resulting
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.560]   in a rebound in equities in the second half of 2022.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.760]   So this thought process also implies 3,666 on the S&P 500 is the bottom of this latest
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   bear market.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.000]   Now, obviously, there are no certainties when it comes to investing, only thoughts and predictions.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.280]   But if we look at the S&P 500 where it is right now at 3,900, the valuations are reasonable.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.460]   It's about 15.5 times price to earnings.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.040]   The only problem is that Wall Street analysts have not started aggressively cutting their
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   earnings estimates to account for a slowdown in the economy.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.140]   So let's say the P/E multiple contracts by 7% to 8% to 14x, with a 10% downward revision
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.120]   in earnings to 226 for the S&P 500.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.640]   Then we're talking about 3,163 on the S&P 500 for another 14%, 15% downside.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   Is that possible?
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.620]   Definitely, that's possible.
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.700]   Is it likely?
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.220]   I don't think it's likely if inflation really is turning the corner in the second half of
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.760]   2022.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.940]   The other thing to think about is this.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.280]   During downward times, during recessions and so forth, valuations actually go up because
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.040]   earnings go down.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.140]   And the price of the stock or the index doesn't go down as much as the decline in earnings.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.600]   So you might want to think counter cyclically wise, where actually, we should expect valuations
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.860]   to go up if we're indeed going into a recession or a downturn, which is likely to happen.
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.120]   So what's the bottom line for investing in equities in the second half of 2022?
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   I'm a buyer.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.580]   If the S&P 500 drops below 3,700 again, I will be more aggressively buying.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:13.100]   I think with a 70 plus percent probability, 3,666 on the S&P 500 is the low.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:21.340]   And as a result, the S&P 500 should close higher than 3,666 by the end of 2022, probably
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.840]   over 4,000.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.020]   That's my bet.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.900]   So what about the real estate market?
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.100]   Well, if the equities market has reached a bottom and will rebound in the second half,
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.580]   how should one invest in the real estate market?
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.580]   The US median housing price has outperformed the S&P 500 by over 25% year to date because
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.460]   the median home price is up year to date.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.100]   However, the real estate market tends to lag the stock market by six to 12 months on the
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.820]   upside and on the downside due to a lot more friction when it comes to selling, to transacting.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.860]   Think about it.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.680]   You've got to find a new place.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.680]   You got to pack.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.500]   You got to list your property.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.300]   Go through that anxiety.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.380]   Give up your low mortgage rate, right?
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.820]   90 plus percent of mortgage holders have a mortgage rate below 5%.
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.420]   You've got to find an agent.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.540]   You've got to pay those commissions, taxes and fees.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.940]   It's a real pain to transact in real estate compared to investing in stocks.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:28.220]   Therefore, real estate buyers can probably find deals five to 10% off their January 2022
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.820]   price comps over the next six months.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.100]   But any more than a 10% discount, I think it's going to be really hard to find.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.740]   You might be able to find it if you look hard enough and you bargain hard enough, but more
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.460]   than a 10% discount is just really difficult.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.260]   And if equities resume their upward trend and interest rates resume their 40-year downward
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:53.660]   trend by the second half of 2022 or definitely by the end of 2022, then the demand for real
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.540]   estate will likely rebound once again.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.460]   As a result, if you're in the market for a new home or investment property, I say the
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.900]   time to look aggressively for deals is from now until winter.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.180]   Winter is my favorite time to look for deals because anybody listing during the winter
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.180]   holidays is likely more motivated, more desperate than those who can just sit back and wait
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.820]   until better weather, better demand in the spring.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.260]   In conclusion, I see the S&P 500 rebounding in the second half.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.820]   Maybe it goes to 4200, 4300.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.820]   That's the way I'm positioning things.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.980]   In terms of real estate, the opportunity is now over the next six months to find deals
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.260]   as interest rates are still high and there's a lot of uncertainty.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.340]   But if interest rates and mortgage rates come down, that demand is just going to pick right
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.500]   back up again.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   All righty.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.900]   I would love to hear your thoughts about the stock market and the real estate market.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.340]   I'm going to be busy over the next three or four weeks marketing Buy This, Not That, How
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.020]   to Spend Your Way to Wealth and Freedom, my book.

[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.060]   I'm going on a lot of great podcasts.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.460]   Shout out to the Tropical MBA Podcast and also Noah Kagan.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.740]   I really enjoyed talking to you guys.
