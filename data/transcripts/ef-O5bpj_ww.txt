[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   I've gotten a couple emails recently about what storage backups I use.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.440]   I don't think I have a perfect solution for the cloud.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.480]   So for a while I use Dropbox.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.580]   And then when I started recording videos for the podcast, we ran out of space.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.920]   So I switched to Google drive because I got more space with our Google workspace
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.040]   account, but the recent purchase that I made that I am really, really happy with
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.800]   is the Synology 923 plus it's a network attached storage device.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.280]   So it's called a disc station DS 923 plus, and imagine a little device that
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.480]   just has a bunch of hard drives in it that you can plug into your network at home.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.680]   You can attach it to your computer as like a network storage drive.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.280]   But the thing I love about it is that it syncs everything instantly with the cloud.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.180]   So for example, if I'm finishing recording this episode and I take the
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.120]   audio and video files and I put them on that network drive, it's really fast
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.580]   because it's local and it's connected via ethernet, but then that device
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.920]   backs everything up on it in a few folders with the cloud.
