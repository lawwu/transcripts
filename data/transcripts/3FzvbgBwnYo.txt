[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360]   Well, it's January in Minneapolis and we are freezing.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.360]   So talking about modesty seems a little untimely, but perhaps an off-season conversation is
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.400]   a good time to go deeper into the heart of the concerns.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.820]   In any case, God talks about modesty, so I guess the topic is really never out of season.
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.280]   And the specific question today comes from an honest, anonymous listener to the podcast
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.280]   who writes this.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.040]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast and for your honesty.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.320]   I will speak honestly here.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.840]   I am a 22-year-old single woman consumed with my physical appearance and how pretty others
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.260]   think I am.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.840]   God is definitely working on me though because I don't buy clothes or other material things
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.620]   nearly as much as I used to, and he's also given me a desire to dress modestly.
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.240]   But I still care a lot about how I look and I find it hard to buy modest clothing because
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.580]   I think more revealing clothing is sexier.
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.320]   I trust in my looks to get me a husband more than God.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.240]   I think that's the root of the issue for me.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.060]   I continuously look for compliments and when I do get one, my ego is fed, and when I don't
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.800]   get one, my ego craves more attention.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.860]   I hate judging myself and others on their physical appearance.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.280]   It's tiring, disgusting, and not at all pleasing to the Lord.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.320]   I don't want to be like the women in Isaiah 3 verses 16-26.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.840]   Can you help me know how to cultivate beauty in my heart and in my faith in God alone?
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:35.260]   One of the things that our 22-year-old friend does not tell us is what she spends her time
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.840]   feasting her eyes on.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.760]   So I would just say as a kind of preempting strike at a stream that feeds the river of
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:58.840]   sensuality, if you are spending hour after hour watching television, movies, videos,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.480]   there's little hope that you will be set free from the bondage of wanting to look sexy.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.840]   And it is a bondage.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.960]   You've described it as one.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:20.380]   Because that desire, that bondage, is continuously fed and strengthened, both blatantly and subtly,
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.760]   in almost all advertisements and programming.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.240]   Just when you think you have found a program that might not awaken that desire, there's
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.620]   that one scene and the whole month's worth of mortifying sin is undone in a moment.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.600]   So let's take the words of Jesus.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.960]   I don't know how many women do this, but we all should.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   I mean, men don't have to take this because it's addressed to us directly.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   It's our issue.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.080]   But women should do this.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.400]   Let's take the words of Jesus that are addressed to men in Matthew 5, 27-29, and convert them
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.720]   into appropriate language for women.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.440]   And believe me, and Tony would vouch for this, I think, based on the questions we're getting
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.880]   at APJ, there are major sexual temptation issues going on for women, as well as men,
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880]   of all kinds.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.600]   Here's what Jesus would say if he had said those words today.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.520]   You have heard that it was said, "You shall not commit adultery, you women.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.040]   You should not commit adultery."
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.520]   But I say to you that every woman who looks at a man, or a woman with sexy outfit, or
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.120]   a kissing scene on television, or who reads about sexual intercourse in a novel, or listens
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.680]   to one on Audible, or does anything else that feeds the desire to lure a man's eyes with
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.320]   sexiness has already committed adultery in her heart.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.540]   He's going to be just as blunt with women as he is with us guys, surely.
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.120]   If your right eye causes you to sin, woman, tear it out, throw it away, for it is better
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.160]   that you lose one of your members than that your whole body would be thrown into hell.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.720]   Jesus says that to men and women.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.000]   Now when Jesus says, "Tear out your eye," surely he at least means stop using the eye
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.760]   to feed the desire.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.240]   It may not be possible to avoid every sin-awakening sight in our culture, but it is possible to
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.480]   keep dozens of them out of your eye, and it is possible to set before you worthy things,
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.640]   holy things, beautiful things, whatever's true, whatever's honorable, whatever's just,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.480]   whatever's pure, whatever's lovely, whatever's commendable, if there's any excellence, if
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.680]   there's anything worthy of praise, think about these things.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.480]   Surely Paul said that in Philippians 4, 8, because of the principle, "Garbage in, garbage
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.480]   out," or "Sexy in, sexy out."
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.520]   The principle here is find the streams that are feeding the river of sensual desire and
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.000]   cut it off.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.680]   Our friend says, "But I still care a lot about how I look and find it hard to buy modest
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.880]   clothing because I think more revealing clothing is sexier."
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.520]   Well, of course revealing clothing is sexier.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:26.780]   So then the question is, why would you want to offer your sexiness to every passerby?
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.560]   And she suggests part of the answer in the next sentence.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.960]   She says, "I trust in my looks to get me a husband more than I trust in God.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.560]   That's the root issue, I think."
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.920]   And my response to that is, personally, I doubt it.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.780]   I doubt that's the root issue, since there are many married women who intend to stay
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.760]   married who try to look sexy for everybody to see.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.080]   And there are many single women who have no intention of getting married anytime soon
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.240]   who also try to look sexy for everybody to see.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.800]   So I doubt that the desire for a husband is the root issue.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.260]   But let me say something about that, since she raised it, and that's obviously a big
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:16.120]   issue for her, the guy you are attracting by sexiness is not the guy you want to marry.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.840]   And I'm going to repeat it.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.160]   The guy you are attracting by sexiness is not the guy you want to marry.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:32.360]   Jesus is telling the guy you want to marry to tear out his eye instead of looking at
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.160]   you when you dress like that.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.820]   That's not going to work.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:42.360]   Of course sexy is power, and that's closer to the root issue, isn't it?
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.320]   Many women know that revealing more skin gets them more power.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.240]   But here's the catch.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.120]   Of course there's more power in sexiness if you want to pull a man by his hormones
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.120]   and not his heart.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.720]   Let me be more crass, okay?
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.280]   So it can be crass here on this issue.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.160]   There's more power in sexiness if your aim is to hook a man in his groin and not his
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.660]   godliness.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.800]   Of course this is not rocket science.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.840]   It's not the way you want to find a husband.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.840]   Please, it's not.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.760]   Trust me, 22-year-old, you're my daughter.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.160]   Here's another sentence that goes deeper, I think.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160]   She got this one.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.720]   It goes deeper than the desire for a husband, and this is the heart of the matter.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:37.040]   She says, "I continuously look for compliments, and when I do get one, my ego is fed, and
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.080]   when I don't get one, my ego craves attention."
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.480]   That's right, and it's not unique to women.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.640]   John Piper is as vulnerable to that as anybody.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   It is utterly and deeply human.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.000]   It is very near the core of what makes us a fallen sinner.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.560]   The Pharisees, Jesus said, lived for the approval and praise of other people, and he called
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.560]   it one of those deadly dispositions in the world and said in John 5:44 that it'll keep
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.720]   you from believing in Jesus.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.600]   How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   that comes from God?
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.760]   John 5, 44, one of the most damning sentences in the Bible for those who live for the praise
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.800]   of other people because it cuts them off from what it means to embrace Jesus as Savior and
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.040]   Lord and treasure.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:33.160]   Paul said in Romans 2, 28 that true Christianity is not outward and physical but inward, a
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:39.720]   matter of the heart, by the Spirit, and for the true Christian, here's the key sentence,
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.760]   his praise is not from man but from God.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.680]   Oh, God let it be for all of us.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.760]   This is the core issue in life.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.960]   Where is this woman's hope for acceptance and love and affirmation and significance
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.160]   and satisfaction?
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.800]   Where is it?
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:10.640]   Just when we read about the beauty that 1 Peter calls for against superficial external
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.080]   beauty, we stop reading just before we get to the key verse 5 in chapter 3.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.120]   Here's what I mean, here's what he says, this is verse 3 of chapter 3 in 1 Peter, "Do not
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.360]   let your adorning be external, the braiding of hair, the putting on of gold jewelry, or
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.480]   the clothing that you wear.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:36.840]   But let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable beauty
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.520]   of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious."
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.120]   And that's where we often stop.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:51.520]   Here's what happens if you keep going, "For this is how the holy women who hoped in God
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.760]   used to adorn themselves."
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.440]   And then it ends to say, "You can be like these holy women, you are her children, if
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.480]   you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening."
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:12.540]   Fearless hope in God, that's the great need of men and women.
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.840]   God is 10,000 times greater than any husband.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:23.520]   His look of approval and favor is 10,000 times more valuable than the glance of any
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:32.240]   hormone-heated man in an airport, or any woman who says, "Cute outfit, oh how wonderful
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:39.800]   and satisfying and significant is the identity that God offers us in Jesus."
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.840]   So I'm saying, I wish I knew her name, but I'm saying to our friend, our 22-year-old
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:50.880]   honest friend who represents thousands, ask the Lord to make this, what I'm going to
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:57.960]   close reading right now, this text, ask him to make this deeply, personally, even sexually
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.720]   sufficient, "Fear not, for I have redeemed you.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:11.600]   I have called you by name, you are mine, because you are precious in my eyes and honored.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.960]   I love you.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:20.320]   I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.560]   Fear not, I am with you.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:33.040]   Everyone who is called by my name whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made."
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.040]   Isaiah 43, 1-7.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   Powerful.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.560]   I mean, lots to think about, Pastor John.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.560]   Thank you for addressing modesty with this bluntness and the straightforwardness, and
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.760]   thank you for listening, and thank you for making the podcast part of your week.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.680]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive, even reach
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.760]   us by email with a question you may have, even questions that relate to more controversial
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.520]   dimensions of the Christian life.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:03.880]   You can do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.280]   Well do non-Christians ever please God?
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.640]   Do they ever honor Him, or is this simply impossible?
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.160]   That's the question on Friday.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160]   It's a big one.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.520]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.800]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.300]   We'll see you then.
