[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140]   Has anybody else seen due to an IMAX? No, don't say anything. Oh,
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.600]   don't say anything about dune. I want to say about dune. No,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.040]   don't say it. It is fantastic. And I want to see it. Okay.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.120]   That's all I'm saying is that it's worth seeing twice. I don't
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.520]   even want to know that you think it's good. It's over. It makes
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.040]   me stop. See, he didn't sex didn't see it. I saw dune dune
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.840]   to Yeah, I saw it. It's over. Okay, stop, stop. Okay, stop.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.720]   Everybody. You both did. It's not over. There's like five
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.000]   great scenes. Sachs. The scene.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:58.400]   All right, everybody, welcome to the all in podcast with me
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.240]   again, the chairman dictator come off Polly hoppity. David
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.920]   Sachs, the rain men. Yeah. And Sultan of science, David
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.840]   Freeberg. It's your boy j cow here and we have so much to go
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.720]   through. The DOJ dropped a Sherman x suit on Apple today
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.120]   right as we were about to tape the program seems like
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.000]   Thursday's is the big news drop day now. So this DOJ suit
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.320]   outlines five alleged abuses and they claim obviously that
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.160]   those abuses reduce competition, while limiting consumer choice
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.760]   and raising the prices that consumers pay for their iPhone.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.080]   We talked about this actually just a couple of weeks ago, we
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.760]   talked about peak Apple. The five categories are very quickly
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.560]   super apps, cloud gaming apps, messaging apps, smartwatches,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.840]   and digital wallets. If you don't know about super apps,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.240]   that's the one that's maybe you haven't heard of if you're
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.960]   listening to this. In Asia, they mentioned how Ali pay we chat
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.920]   and pay TM are super apps. What does that mean? You get like
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.680]   five or six different functions in one app, social media images,
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.160]   purchasing, getting rides, you know, all that stuff. And when
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.040]   you have that you can move from one platform to another super
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.640]   easily. And when it comes to messaging apps, we've all
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.880]   experienced the green bubble friend. So the main argument of
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.000]   the lawsuit, pretty interesting. They explain and it's a really
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.600]   well written document, I read it this morning, that when Apple
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.000]   faces new competition, instead of lowering prices, for
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   consumers, or offering a better deal to developers, they would
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.720]   quote meet competitive threats by imposing a series of
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.440]   shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its app store
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.960]   guidelines, and developer agreements. I've faced this
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.640]   every time I've invested in an app startup, they complain about
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.120]   the goalposts moving by Apple and Apple shares down about 3%
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.280]   on the news today. I'm sure everybody's got some interesting
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.880]   thoughts on it. Chamath, you were talking about peak Apple
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.440]   just last week or the week before, I think. What are your
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.200]   thoughts on the lawsuit dropped today?
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.960]   To be honest, I haven't read it. And I don't really know. Like
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.480]   the odds of these things, just because it seems like some of
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.200]   this stuff is so clearly political. And I think that
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.480]   these things have seasons to it in the sense that there are
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.440]   moments where these things are more likely to go in the favor
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.320]   of the company and more likely to go in favor of the
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.800]   government. The one thing I'll say is that these guys have been
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.200]   losing a fair number of these things. So they're kind of 5050
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.280]   in their fight with Epic. They've basically lost against
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.360]   their fight with Spotify. They definitely are in a moment where
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.760]   people are looking at the profitability of these devices
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.280]   as the source of their long term cash flow. And I think they
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.400]   realize that there's not a lot of growth because they haven't
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.640]   entered a bunch of new markets. So the real question is knowing
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.520]   all of that, did they do something beyond what they've
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.760]   already always done to try to lock people in? And can they
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.080]   prove it? I think that that's really where the government's
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.520]   case will come down to. Because then it's clear that Apple
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.680]   probably understood that their market was kind of solidifying.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.120]   And they introduced these blocks essentially into processes that
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.680]   that force people to stay. That's probably bad news for
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.480]   them. But I don't really know because I haven't read the
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.600]   lawsuit. Yeah,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.520]   Saks did you get a chance to read it? Or do you have any
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.440]   thoughts? Generally speaking?
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.440]   I haven't read the filings. But I read some of the press
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.400]   coverage about it. I would say based on the press coverage that
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.440]   I read that there's not really a smoking gun here. At least the
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.080]   press hasn't reported one. And what I mean by that is the link
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.760]   give you a couple of examples that were in the press. One is
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.240]   that apparently the filing made a point about when Tim Cook was
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.280]   confronted some time ago by a user saying when I try to send a
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.440]   video by text to someone with an Android phone, it just doesn't
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.160]   work very well. It never works. It was a guy trying to send a
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.560]   video to his mom. And Tim Cook responded, well, your mom should
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.840]   buy an iPhone. It's kind of like a throwaway comment by Tim Cook,
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.800]   probably not a great idea for him to say that. But that's an
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.520]   example of what the lawsuit brings up. Another example is
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.600]   that the Apple Watch doesn't work with Android phones. You
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.880]   know, it only works with iPhones, obviously. Again, is
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.120]   that really a smoking gun issue? I don't think so. I mean, it's,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.760]   this is Apple's whole strategy is that all of its products work
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.680]   seamlessly together. And Apple hardware doesn't really work
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.160]   with other operating systems. It never has. So at least based on
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.480]   the press coverage, I have yet to see a single smoking gun
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   example coming out of this lawsuit. Now, I think what those
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.360]   examples highlight is what this lawsuit is really about is your
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.160]   view of interoperability. What the government is saying is that
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.000]   Apple needs to make its apps and its devices more interoperable
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.160]   with other ecosystems. So the watch needs to be interoperable
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.120]   with Android. Apple messaging needs to be interoperable with
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.360]   Android messaging, and so on. What the government is saying is
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.400]   that Apple is refusing to play ball with other applications,
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   other operating systems, and that creates a monopolistic
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   network effect. What I think Apple would say is no, the fact
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.400]   is that Apple from the outset has always tried to do
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.200]   everything soup to nuts, we've always done the hardware and the
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   software together. And that's what creates the magical
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.720]   experience. And so Apple's entire product strategy is based
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.360]   on creating a vertically integrated stack that goes from
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.040]   hardware to operating system, to key applications. And I think
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.200]   Apple has a point saying, if you try to make us unwind all of
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.960]   that, the products is not going to work as well. It's not gonna
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.160]   be the same product experience that everyone's used to. So
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.800]   again, I think that how you view interoperability is at the core
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.600]   of this lawsuit, I think that both the government and Apple
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.560]   make good points about that. And I'm a little bit skeptical right
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.160]   now that the government has a smoking gun, at least one hasn't
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.960]   been reported in the press. And so I'm a little bit doubtful
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.280]   right now that the government's gonna be able to win this case.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.320]   Freeberg, any thoughts?
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.880]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's a function of consumer choice. If
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.000]   consumers want to have this closed system where they can I
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.720]   message with other I message app holders and not be able to have
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.800]   a seamless integrated messaging experience with Android users,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.040]   they'll be happy if they're annoyed, they'll switch over to
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.520]   an Android. So you know, this has always been Apple's
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.040]   orientation. I think I mentioned this to you guys. I've been on a
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.400]   Mac since 1984. When the Mac original came out, I still have
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.320]   my first Mac original, by the way, I keep it in my office on
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.280]   my shelf. And Apple's, you know, always had like a really hard
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.320]   focus on the software that they make available to their users to
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.440]   create an incredible product experience. So I don't know if
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.160]   this is necessarily about market abuse as much as it is a
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.120]   consumer choice. If the consumers didn't like the
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.040]   product, they didn't like the fact that things were not
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.680]   available, that things were very expensive, they would go
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.160]   elsewhere. And you do see that in segments of the market. And
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   as we talked about a few weeks ago, you do see that x us most
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.560]   of the smartphone market is actually Android driven. Yeah.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.080]   So this is a premium product that people are willing to pay a
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.480]   premium price for even if that means limited access. I think
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.920]   developers are frustrated that they can't access this premium
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.520]   market. But I'm not sure that Apple necessarily should be
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.320]   coerced to service developers. When at the end of the day, the
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.840]   consumers are paying for the products.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.920]   And to your point, like, is it is it really the case that a
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.800]   green bubble versus a blue bubble is really that limiting?
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.240]   You know, it's not annoying. It's annoying. But it's not the
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.560]   end of the world. Yeah, I would say Apple has completely abused
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.200]   their power every chance they get in order to capture this 30%
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.520]   from the App Store. They blocked the ability for you to use
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.760]   audible or, you know, other marketplaces to buy books and
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.040]   media. They blocked the ability to use other media players like
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.440]   VLC blocked the ability to use browsers. And if you leave Apple
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.600]   unchecked, they just keep abusing it. So I think this is
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.680]   kind of one of those lawsuits that's like, if we don't stop
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.880]   them, they'll just keep making it worse. And when people file
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.440]   complaints, then Apple will back down, which they did on media
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.840]   players. And they'll stand down. If you think about this from the
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.520]   PC era to now, then you can see how pernicious their behavior is
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.920]   when you buy a laptop, the idea that you would have to go through
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.680]   an App Store and pay a $30 tax to put a piece of software on
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.640]   your computer would seem insane. 30% 30% 30% tax on your which
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.480]   would seem insane. Like if you buy a laptop, you should be able
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.960]   to put whatever software you want on it. But they did this
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.560]   magic trick where they said, Oh, no, if you want to put software
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.800]   on your phone, it has to go through the App Store, it has to
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.400]   be 30%. And that's really the anti competitive thing here. I
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.520]   think this will be settled. And if you look at the different
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.800]   issues here, I think this is going to be actually a huge win
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.440]   for Apple. Because if I message were to exist on Android, they
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.600]   would get all of those users to download I message and they
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.760]   would have all those users if they made the watch compatible,
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.520]   they would open up many more people to buy the watch. And you
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.880]   would get more watches. I think that Apple's thinking way too
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.200]   short term about the lock in here. And they should allow more
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.280]   of these apps allow more watches and they should allow the gaming
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.360]   thing. I think that they're being petty.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.680]   I don't think anything's going to happen here because it's
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:46.000]   taken them five years to file. There's a at least a 50% chance
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.520]   that the administration is going to turn over, which means that
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.520]   this lawsuit changes or goes away entirely. And then even if
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.560]   it does kind of proceed, it's going to take 10 years of very
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.320]   detailed arguments for something to happen. And frankly, probably
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.280]   in 10 years from now, we've already moved to a different
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.120]   compute platform, and this is not going to matter.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.240]   I mean, there there is the coin toss of what the Trump
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.560]   administration would do here. For sure, that's valid. But I
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.640]   think these things will get settled. I think the settlement
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.880]   will be I message releases, they allow the thing about the Apple
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.600]   watch. It's not just sacks that they're allowing it on Android.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.760]   It's would you allow Android watches to connect with the SDK
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.840]   directly into the iOS operating system, which they block you
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   from doing. I think they should just have a little switch in
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.560]   your Friedberg settings that allows you to flip it and say I
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.040]   take responsibility for allowing third party stores. And I want
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.240]   to be able to load any software. It's your computer.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.880]   I don't think the government should should regulate I don't
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.960]   think the government should be able to mandate. Yeah, I mean,
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.320]   I like the fact that everyone is looking to the government to do
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.120]   things that they want as a consumer, make your choice with
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.800]   your dollars. Make your vote with the product and service you
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.680]   want to buy. Instead of running to the government and asking the
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.720]   government to come and do stuff. I feel that way about price
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.560]   fixing. We mean price fixing in what context if like a group of
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.280]   people price fix the price cost of a phone or like let's say the
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.560]   30% from the app store, which just happens to be the same
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.400]   between two app stores. Getting price fixing is something valid
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.040]   for the government to come in. It's not the same. Do you think
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.360]   price fixing is something the government should come in on is
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.680]   the question if there's limited access to products in a market
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.480]   and all the participants get together to set the price in the
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.200]   market. I do think that's anti competitive. And that's there's
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.840]   a good role for the government to play there. But Google and
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.040]   Apple don't price fix because Android is an open access
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.360]   system. You can put any application you want any way you
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.520]   want. There are several app stores to put Android apps on
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.800]   your Android device. Google operates an app store called
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.560]   Google Play. But there are other app stores you can go to as
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.920]   well. And they all have different prices and Google's
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.720]   app store costs, by the way, are not apples, and they're not 30%.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.080]   And we talked about this last time, I'll pull it up for you.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.800]   Again, it's like 15 to 12 going down to sliding scale. So there
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.560]   is competition in that market. Generally, I think the point
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.760]   about if there's limited access to a market for products for
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.080]   consumers, and everyone in that market gets together and sets a
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.840]   price that is anti competitive, and there's a good role for
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.960]   government to play there. But I don't think that having the
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.280]   government come in and say, I want this feature to have this
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.920]   button and this flip in my app is what I want my government
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.200]   doing. I want my government protecting me from crime. And,
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.000]   you know, defending the country. And I don't want all the other
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.360]   stuff that the government does to drive costs up, which is
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.640]   generally what the government does.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.520]   So what do you think the role of the government is here in terms
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.680]   of anti competitiveness, especially in the case, I'm
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.800]   curious your thoughts on a duopoly. Like, if you look at
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.080]   Google search monopoly, pretty easy to understand, like, hey,
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.160]   they got 90%. But here you got two players who have, you know,
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.360]   roughly 50% of the market each or 6040, depending on where you
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.640]   are. So what is the the proper role of government here? And is
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.120]   this an over reach?
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.760]   No, I mean, I actually think just to give the government
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.040]   lawsuit some credit, I actually think it's good to hold apples
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.280]   feet to the fire and make sure they're not engaging in
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.240]   anti competitive tactics. One of the things I've said
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.480]   previously on the show, is that I think the government's been
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.880]   making the mistake of going after bigness for its own sake.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.720]   And I don't think that bigness in and of itself is bad, it
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.240]   might be a reflection that the company's done an incredibly
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.120]   good job. And that's why it has a lot of customers a lot of
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.680]   market share. What I've said is, I think the government should
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.840]   prevent anti competitive tactics. So I think that this
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.600]   lawsuit is good in the sense that it's targeted at the right
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.320]   types of things. It's not just going after Apple, because its
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.720]   market cap is so big, it's going after specific things that it's
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.960]   doing to kind of lock in its network effect. Now, the problem
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.480]   that I see is just that the examples that we've been given
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.360]   so far from the lawsuit just don't seem that compelling.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.320]   Again, I'm kind of waiting to find out where's the smoking
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.680]   gun here. But to freebirds point, I mean, look, I don't
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.520]   think you can just say that. If you don't like what Apple is
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.960]   doing, go to a different platform. Because the point is
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:05.080]   that there's only two choices. And they can both engage in
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.680]   anti competitive tactics, and they can both create lock in.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.280]   But sex, there are not just two choices. Android is an open
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.040]   operating system, Google has a fork of Android, that they put
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.800]   on certain smartphones, there are other smartphone makers that
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.040]   use other forks of Android. So Android has enabled and the
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.560]   reason Google bought Android was to provide a counterbalance to
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.920]   exactly the dynamic of one handset manufacturer, having an
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.840]   operating system that could control access to the internet
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.720]   and to apps. And so Google open source Android, many handset
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.480]   manufacturers use their own versions of Android to put their
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.560]   own experience on the phone. And then Android users can put apps
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.280]   from anywhere they want. And other companies offer app stores.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.560]   So there are many app stores to go to. And there are many
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.640]   different handset manufacturers. And a lot of
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.280]   people, I think incorrectly, look at the operating system
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.600]   landscape and mobile and say, Oh, there's Android and there's
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.160]   iOS. But Android is an open platform. And there are many
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.160]   different forks of it run by many different companies. So I
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.480]   think that is actually a very competitive market, like we
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.960]   talked about last week, I think close to 80% of global handsets
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.800]   are run on Android forks. So you know, it's not necessarily the
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.520]   case that there are only two choices. And Google does not
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.200]   control Android. There are many developers that contribute to
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.800]   open source their Google has their own fork that they do a
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.600]   lot of work on. But anyone can take their own fork and do I
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.680]   mean, you guys can, you know, when you when you when you boot
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.640]   up a Samsung or Sony TV, that's running Android. And that's
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.000]   running their own version of Android.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.280]   Are you arguing that Apple doesn't have market power?
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.440]   In the US? They do X us there? You know?
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.520]   Yeah, I mean, I think sure, we're talking about the US
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.000]   market.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.240]   I mean, are they about 5050? We pulled this chart up last week.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.080]   In the US now it might be 5545 right now. Yeah, something like
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.480]   that. The issue is the cat and mouse that Apple is really good
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.480]   at playing, they will push their advantage. And so we see the
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.880]   five things that the Justice Department wants to go after
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.640]   here, but the App Store is obviously one of them. And
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.920]   before that, I mentioned some of the other categories where they
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.160]   do this abusive power, they basically keep it up as much as
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.360]   they can until they get checked. And I think interoperability is
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.880]   actually in the long term going to be in their best interest.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.480]   They use interoperability when they need it. So Apple Music and
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.000]   iTunes, they allow you to use Windows and Android, it's only
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.520]   when they see an advantage. And that's really the hypocrisy of
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.080]   Apple. And I think it's a really important that the industry
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.240]   stand for more interoperability and the ability for you to load
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.120]   any software that you want on your device, this is a compute
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.240]   platform, the ability for them to block you from installing
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.080]   your own apps on it, I think is a really terrible.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.600]   What you're saying is a very fair statement from a consumer
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.160]   point of view and from an industry point of view. And
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.720]   that's where that voice should come from to force in the
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.760]   marketplace changes from Apple. But having the government do
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.840]   this and having the government involved, I think sets all these
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.120]   bad representing the
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.560]   people he did it, they asked him cook to do it. And Tim Cook said
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.200]   pound salt, buy a phone for your mom.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.920]   No, but aren't they representing the people? Like, how do you
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.760]   expect the people to organize like file a class action?
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.800]   No, I think if enough companies boycott the Apple platform and
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.640]   tell consumers to boycott, they'll, I mean, consumers can
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.080]   make decisions. That's developers can make decisions
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   whether or not they want to develop for out. No, that's not
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.160]   realistic. You know, not really. That's nice. Come on. I don't
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.760]   think I want the government stepping in to tell private
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.000]   companies what to do, because customers don't like what
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.400]   they're doing.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.200]   Wait, do you think that the government should have stepped
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.800]   in to prevent Microsoft from taking over the browser, the
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   whole Netscape case?
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.160]   Bundling? I don't know the case well enough. I mean, I remember
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.520]   it, but I don't want to speak. I don't want to speak definitively
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.320]   I think there was a substantial chance that if the government
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.160]   didn't step in, then Microsoft would have extended their
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.800]   Windows operating system monopoly.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.000]   They did have an absolute monopoly. They did have a
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.400]   monopoly on personal compute. Oh, it wasn't an absolute
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.160]   monopoly. I mean, you could use Macintosh using Macintosh.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.800]   At the time, Macintosh was like 5% of the market was under 10%
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.480]   at the time. Yeah, it was about four or 5%. At that time, it was
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.520]   a do off. Microsoft was 95% of the personal computing market.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.760]   So they did have an absolute monopoly choice. You had a
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.560]   consumer choice. It wasn't a very good consumer choice, but
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.840]   you still have a choice. You could go use Macintosh. And you
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.600]   did you could afford it. Yeah. Okay. But the point is that
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.360]   Microsoft had substantial market power. And what they were in the
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.560]   process of doing was the smart thing from a business
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.520]   standpoint, which is you take your operating system monopoly,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.000]   you use that to extend into the browser, you kill Netscape, you
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.160]   take over with Explorer, you bake Explorer into your Windows
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.280]   operating system. So the two things are basically the same.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.520]   Then there, hold on from there, you leverage your control of the
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.560]   browser in the home screen to control search. Okay. So you
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.640]   think about like all the dominoes that would have fallen
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.160]   if Microsoft had continued, maybe if like Bill Gates,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.320]   continuing CEO, and there would have been no Google, there would
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.560]   have been no Yahoo, they would have controlled the internet,
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.640]   they would have controlled the internet. And they were actively
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.320]   you left out a big piece of it. sex, which you'll remember the
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.400]   second I say it, they were trying to break HTML and open
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.760]   standards by creating ActiveX and using funky code. That's
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.560]   right. So you have to understand these companies will if you give
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.360]   them an inch, they'll take the mile. And that's exactly what
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.240]   Apple does consistently, they consistently try to squeeze. I
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.360]   think it's great. sax is right. tactics is the way to go after
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.440]   these companies. These are five recent tactics. I think though
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.680]   the government's going to win changing three of these. And
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.040]   that's when that's a win for me.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.080]   Yeah, the mobile operators try to do the same at that same
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.000]   time. If you guys remember, Verizon, yes, singular, they you
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.080]   could only put their apps if you bought it through their store on
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.160]   their operating system on the mobile phones that they
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.960]   contracted to have made. So they all had their own custom version
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.880]   of the handset manufacturers, OS, which I'll get and then they
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.080]   did RedShare back with the manufacturers. And that's why
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.120]   Android was acquired. It wasn't actually at the time to compete
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.600]   with Apple, Android was acquired to compete with all the mobile
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.480]   phone companies that were trying to block access to the internet
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:02.960]   maps.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.560]   Well, Google wanted to maintain its search monopoly. Let's be
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.080]   honest. That's why they bought it. They knew for users would be
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.560]   there. And they wanted to have the default
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   access to the internet block. Yeah, by this by the handset,
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.640]   man, they wanted to be the browser in the app, which is
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.400]   what you have to agree to, by the way. So if you don't want to
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.800]   talk about perniciousness and heavy handedness, we have an
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   Android, you and you want to use the Android that's not correct.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.320]   Google, that's not correct. No, no, you have to give the bundle
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.080]   of apps if you want the updates and support from Google, you
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.480]   can forget, then you don't get their support, which then breaks
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.520]   your phone if you want their version. That's right. Yes.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.600]   Yeah. So they, you know, there's a little cleverness here, I
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.080]   think. So you have two basic ecosystems and mobile, it is a
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.720]   duopoly, and both of them advantage themselves in ways
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:51.800]   that grow over time. And I think that if Apple were completely
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.040]   left unchecked, it would figure out ways to boil the frog and
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.520]   keep extracting more and more value out of downstream
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.240]   applications.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.000]   Totally. Repairing 1600 a phone now. Yeah, how are we paying
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.520]   1600 a phone? So look, I think it's I think it's good for the
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.800]   government to hold their feet to the fire. But here's the thing
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.840]   that the government's lacking is, again, that example they can
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.600]   point to that's really compelling. I mean, with the
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.640]   Microsoft Netscape thing, it was really obvious what they were
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.480]   doing, right? The browser was the gateway to the whole new
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.080]   platform, which was the internet. And if Microsoft could
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.600]   make that a feature of the operating system, their dominance
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   would extend into the new computing platform. But you
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.040]   remember how they did it sacks Apple Watch is just not the same
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.680]   thing. The Apple Watch is kind of an appendage of your phone
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.080]   that most people don't even want. So it's hard to point to
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.600]   something. Do you remember sex how they were getting the
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.120]   browser built in? They were going to the OEMs, the dells of
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.440]   the world, the HP isn't saying, if you want this price for
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.080]   Windows, you have to include the browser on the desktop, it has
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.960]   to load, it has to ask your credentials, all this stuff. Or
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.800]   you could pay $150 for Windows. And if you want it without the
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.320]   browser bundle, so they use this pricing to get the OEMs to bundle
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.200]   it. And that that was where isn't that what Google's doing
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.480]   with Android effectively? Exactly. Is like, it's exactly
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.920]   right. You can have your own version without Google search.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.120]   If you're willing to put up with all these headaches, and these
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.880]   calls in an operating system, update the operating system.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.400]   Yeah, that's exactly what they're doing. So anyway, I
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.840]   think three out of five of these get settled, and it'll be good
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.400]   for consumers. Ultimately, I would not financial advice, but
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.080]   I think that Apple is going to be able to manage this, I'd buy
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.120]   the stock, I may buy more of the stock, I think that this will be
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.080]   good for them long term. Alright, listen, going even
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.280]   deeper into Apple, and this Google relationship, big
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.960]   questions emerged this week, as Bloomberg reported that Apple was
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.160]   speaking to both Google and open AI about powering certain AI
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.320]   features on iOS specifically, according to the article, this
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.280]   deal between Apple and Google seems much more likely than the
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.840]   opening I want and could happen this year. As you know, we've
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.640]   talked about it on this show before Google has been the
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.880]   default search engine on iPhone for I think over a decade now.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.000]   And Google pays Apple 20 billion a year, that's pure profit for
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.460]   Apple. It's unclear what features they would power with
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.920]   Google Gemini. Maybe it's like the search deal and Google
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.600]   Gemini is on there. Maybe it's built in. And Apple has been
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.640]   building its own LLM. It's called Ajax. They've been doing
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.520]   some other open source stuff called Maggie. What do you think
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.580]   Shama? If you were talking about this on Twitter, you get a
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.640]   pretty good tweet and a pretty strong position. If Apple is
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.360]   going to use Gemini, what does that say to you about Apple and
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.240]   their view of the future?
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.440]   I think it's them giving up this is the most consequential new
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.840]   development in technology and compute in probably 20 years, 30
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.520]   years. And so to be spending 10s of billions of dollars of R&D
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.600]   and to not have enough allocated to this, so that you have a
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.720]   legitimate path forward to do it yourself, I think is a little
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:07.240]   inexcusable, actually. It's akin to IBM in the 70s, going to
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.680]   Microsoft and and basically asking them to build the
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.720]   operating system for them. When you're such a dominant company
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.880]   in such a dominant position, but you abdicate your responsibility
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:24.320]   to innovate. I think that that's a really bad situation for a
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.120]   company to be in.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.200]   It's like Yahoo adding Google search, right?
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.680]   And then by the way, on the heels of like, turning off cars
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:36.840]   and, and losing these antitrust issues in Europe, and then being
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.680]   sued by the DOJ here, to then be in a licensing discussion with a
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.440]   third party for such a critical technology, I think is just says
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.440]   not very good things about the state of the company.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.560]   Freeberg, your thoughts on this potential deal? We don't know
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.000]   what feature is this with power? I don't know if it's Siri, or
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.040]   it's just image editing, or search, or an extension of
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.440]   search, maybe giving an answer.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.200]   I have no idea. It seems to me like there's, if, if Apple's
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.080]   doing the right thing, which I'm sure they are, they're probably
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.480]   building their own alternative platform here, they realize it's
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.840]   going to take them some time in the interim, they want to have a
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.400]   stopgap. And my guess is, by going to Google, they're
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.080]   probably going to get paid, instead of having to pay someone
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   else for the technology. Because Google will realize some benefit
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.320]   from getting users over to search results and seeing ads.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.800]   So Google will probably benefit and pay them instead of them
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.440]   having to go pay someone for access to some technology that
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.760]   consumers might want access to.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.400]   Sachs, any thoughts here?
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.440]   I'm sure Apple is going to make an investment in building their
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.120]   own models here.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.560]   Yeah, I mean, who would look at the launch of Google Gemini and
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.880]   say, I want that. That launch was a total fiasco.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.320]   Another woke company. I think it's the Apple philosophy.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.120]   How woke would Tim Cook have to be to look at the launch of
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.120]   Gemini and say, Oh, yeah, I don't see anything wrong there.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.200]   You got that exactly right.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:05.120]   Absolutely. I want that. Yeah, Siri, show me the President of
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.000]   the United States.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.200]   I mean, apparently, Tim Cook is the only person on earth who's
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.720]   impressed with the launch of Google Gemini. I mean, I can't
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.360]   believe the story is true. It's just it can't be true.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:21.880]   I'm so excited today to launch Gemini on stage here. iOS 27. Oh
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.440]   my god, can you imagine him on stage doing searches live?
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.920]   The story can't be true, because it'd be so strategically dumb.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.600]   Like Jamal said, even if Google Gemini were great, you'd still
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.440]   want to invest in having your own thing because it's such a
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.680]   strategic technology. Why would you ever outsource it to your
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.520]   main competitor? But in this case, you know that Gemini was
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.880]   terrible. It was a fiasco. And so the story makes no sense. I
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.680]   just can't believe it's true.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.800]   It's probably people knocking on each other's doors. They spent
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:56.440]   $30 billion last year on R&D 30 billion. Apple to be clear, they
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.840]   spent $30 billion on R&D. What did they spend it on catering?
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:06.200]   I mean, you got to think Apple Vision is a big piece of that,
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.480]   right? Chips, I guarantee you like half of that is like 3m 4
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.200]   30 billion, like, not a couple crumbs fall out of somebody's
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.360]   pocket. And so there's 50 million allocated to just like,
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   you know, mucking around with llama or mucking around with
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.520]   Mistral. What if they took Project Titan, the car car deal
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.080]   that was 10 billion, supposedly they had spent on that. And if
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.000]   they put that towards AI, but again, again, it goes back to
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.720]   the to the people I don't think I don't think the the person in
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.800]   charge of the windshield wipers for Project Titan is going to be
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.560]   the person that figures out how to land a really killer LLM.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.280]   Yeah, that's a different skill set.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.760]   That is not even that expensive. I mean,
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.640]   mechanical engineer wants a computer scientist. So these are
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.600]   not the same people. They're not fungible that way.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.840]   I mean, I guess the question here is Apple, capable of
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.520]   building on a culture basis, Friedberg, this type of
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.240]   software, their hardware company, it's not having their
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.640]   dear standing on the shoulders, the whole open source movement,
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.440]   all you have to do, like Jamal said, all you got to do is take
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.160]   the latest Mistral model or
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.920]   jump on hugging face and start working.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.480]   I mean, you're not starting from zero, because open source,
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.560]   not only you're not starting from zero, not only do you have
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.120]   the foundational models that are excellent and available in open
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.800]   source, you have probably the most prolific set of training
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.840]   data that has ever been created in the entire world to make
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.040]   these models kick ass.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.720]   Yeah, you have all the Apple photos, archive, I wonder if in
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.840]   their terms, that's the thing is their terms of service is so
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.040]   privacy based. I wonder if they could even use that information.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.480]   And I just think, look, at the end of the day, the Apple brand
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:39.040]   is still exceptional. And so if you're given a $10 million a
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.280]   year job at Google, versus a $10 million a year job at meta,
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.480]   versus a 10 million, $10 million a year job at Apple, if you're
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.600]   like one of these killer AI people that get these kinds of
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.960]   offers, I gotta presume that Apple gets their fair share of
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.520]   these people.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.200]   Yeah, you would think
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.320]   and even in the worst case, you see Microsoft doing like, pretty
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.360]   heavy handed deals with companies like open AI, and just
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.960]   this week with inflection. So it's not as as if these deals
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:13.240]   can't be done. Right. And so it just kind of like leaves. I
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.920]   don't know, it's just, it's quizzical, to spend that much
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.160]   money, to not necessarily be willing to compete on the human
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.720]   capital to not necessarily be in the market, acquiring these
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.800]   businesses. I don't know, it's just it's just a question mark,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.480]   like what's going on?
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.920]   Tremont asked what's going on over there. We have some inside
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.440]   footage. Nick, you want to play tape?
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:37.920]   What's going on here?
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:51.640]   I hope we didn't keep you waiting.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.760]   Mother Nature. Welcome to Apple. How was the weather getting in?
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:07.000]   Oh, she's controlling the weather.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.480]   Yeah, they did this couple of but but this reflects their
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.560]   self image. I mean, they release this. They care about the plan.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.400]   No, it's it reflects that they think somehow this is an accurate
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.880]   reflection of the way they do meetings.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.880]   No, I think it was the No, I think it was that we're making
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.720]   is they were trying to do a skit about like how they're doing
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.000]   less packaging and including that that skit was to tell you
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.080]   that you're not getting a charger in your next iPhone
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.520]   because they they don't they want to say it was cringe.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:40.040]   Yeah, it was a little cringe. But yeah, I think it was a little
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.440]   cringe. But I do appreciate that they are doing sustainable
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.640]   products and not putting as much stuff in landfills. So I think
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.840]   they should get a lot of credit for that. What I do think about
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.320]   this deal that's really interesting is it's sort of
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.000]   cementing the Google and the Apple alliance against
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.240]   Microsoft and Microsoft has big, you know, AI ambition. So this
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.440]   is kind of interesting. If you lock in the duopoly of Google
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.720]   and Apple, and then you lock in Google search monopoly, and you
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.760]   start fighting Microsoft, I think that's what we're, I think
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.840]   that's what's probably going on here is they're trying to figure
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.080]   out how do we keep Microsoft away from running away with
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.560]   this. All right, we covered that huge NAR lawsuit back in
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.240]   December. And there has been a settlement big news for the
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.800]   National Association of Realtors. They've agreed to pay
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.680]   $418 million in a settlement last week. And federal jury
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.040]   found that the NAR and several large real estate brokerages
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.360]   conspired to artificially inflate agent commissions. The
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   settlement is pretty, pretty big deal. People are freaking out
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.920]   about it. As you know, the seller of a home pays the buyers
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:51.480]   agents commission. So you have a buyer and a seller 6% fee
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.560]   typically, sometimes it's five, but they split that 3% to the
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.840]   buyer and the seller, but the seller is paying that 3% to the
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.480]   buyer. Now that can't be listed in the MLS anymore. And that
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:07.120]   deal cannot be done ahead of time buyers are responsible for
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.400]   paying their agents commissions going forward. So if you bought
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.280]   a million dollar house, and you were the buyer, you would pay
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.760]   30,000 to your buyers agent or you would choose to not have an
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.360]   agent or you would choose to negotiate it. And you have to
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:26.480]   have a signed contract. This is a crazy, just shocking shock to
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.000]   the system. According to most people who are in it, I've seen
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.600]   a lot of real estate, folks are saying this is going to be
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.720]   healthy, because you have this you have to have this
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.000]   conversation between the buyers agent and the buyer. But
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.440]   commissions in the United States are $100 billion a year. And one
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.480]   analyst projected the lawsuit lead to a 30% reduction in
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.320]   commission payments. And that would eliminate about half of
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.520]   the 1.6 million active NRA members from the industry. You
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.000]   had a lot of feelings on this Friedberg when we talked about
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.360]   it a couple of months ago. What are your thoughts on the
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.400]   settlement? Is anything going to change? Is this as
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.680]   groundbreaking and shocking as people seem to think it is?
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:11.320]   Well, I would take this settlement along with a lot of
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:18.240]   the developments and advances in AI as being the moment of
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.520]   catalyzing real change in the residential real estate agency
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.720]   industry. It's an industry that's been known to have fixed
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:31.240]   pricing and be very expensive to consumers a real tax on the
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.120]   system. And it's largely been wrapped around this idea of
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.880]   mitigating your liability, reducing risk, servicing the
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.120]   customer. Many of those aspects over the last couple of years
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.920]   have been largely standardized through forms, digitized,
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.000]   because so much of this information is no longer going
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.200]   to get paperwork from the courthouse. But a lot of the
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.520]   information sits digitally and can be accessed in a
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.240]   democratized way. And the fact that so much of the service and
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.200]   discovery, reading through documents, understanding what
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.520]   they mean, and what they say can be automated through AI and
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.080]   LLMs. Much of this is kind of coalescing around what I hope
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.640]   and expect will be a more seamless, automated, direct
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:17.240]   marketplace for consumers. The challenge is that most consumers
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:21.800]   put most of their personal net worth into their home. And so it
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.560]   is where most people's net worth is tied up. And so because it is
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:29.800]   such a sensitive investment, and it is their entire savings, they
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.880]   want to have a trusted advisor by them. So it's going to take
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.160]   some time before that trusted advisor becomes some piece of
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.040]   software. But I do think that software is going to play more
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.880]   and more of a role in providing advisory tools and services to
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.800]   consumers in this transaction marketplace. And that's only
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:51.480]   going to catalyze and accelerate the fee reduction. I do project
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.280]   and I do expect that much of what is charged on a commission
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.400]   basis on a percent of home value today will change to being a
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:57.920]   fixed fee.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.240]   And it's 5k 10k for your buyers, a different services. So you can
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.800]   have someone do a la carte do the disclosure diligence for me
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.360]   for 5k, you know, negotiate the purchase for me for 10k. And you
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.240]   as a consumer will start to pick from a menu of the services that
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.880]   you want to have rendered for you and things that you're
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.480]   comfortable doing yourself. I don't need someone to negotiate
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.440]   price. I don't need someone to find me a home. I've got Redfin
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.280]   I can go do that. I can arrange open houses on my own the lock
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.760]   boxes there. I'll go walk around the property. I don't need
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.440]   someone to point out that the color is nice in a room. And so
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.880]   I think that there's elements of what this half of what will
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.440]   happen here, which is a fragmentation and then an
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   automation of these services. And as a result, significant fee
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.480]   reduction. And I'm in the middle of doing this myself right now,
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.400]   with a piece of real estate where I'm not using an agent.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:49.840]   And I've been using a direct listing service. I've used all
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.120]   of these standard forms, there's a lot of AI tools you can use to
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.080]   kind of read all the disclosures for you make sure everything's
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.760]   copacetic. And these escrow agents, they'll handle a lot of
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.680]   what a lawyer will handle. And they'll get paid a you know, a
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.840]   fee, which is much less than the agents fees. So I do think that
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.320]   there's a big disruption happening in this industry. I
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.360]   think it's it's really important for consumers, agents are going
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.000]   to be, you know, hands in the air telling you this is
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.520]   ridiculous, you need someone to help you need an advisor that
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.560]   will continue for a good chunk of the market for a very long
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.640]   period of time. But I do think that it's for the benefit of
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.480]   consumers over time to see these fees come out of the system, and
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.200]   see those savings go back into consumers pockets and for the
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.720]   value of their real estate to go to go in their pockets, not into
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.000]   an agent's pocket, is it going to change the
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.520]   profitability of a realtor? Pretty meaningfully, right?
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.040]   Both realtors won't be able to be in business, right? I think
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.040]   the sellers will do fine. And they might capture more of it
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.200]   because they'll, they'll, my understanding is the set, the,
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.640]   the seller will maybe do both sides of the transaction. No,
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.480]   that's not what's gonna happen. And there's also going to be
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:58.200]   limits on that. But But here's what I will say. If you look at
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.840]   the the number of people, there are 1.4 million members of any
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.280]   are today, the National Association of Realtors. If you
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.360]   look at the distribution of earnings, you guys know this, my
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.720]   guess is probably 10% of those realtors make 40% of the fee
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.600]   income or 50% of the fee income. So there's a long tail. So
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.920]   there's probably a third of those folks who are already kind
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.920]   of sub living standards in terms of income, maybe half of them
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.160]   won't be able to make enough money in this new, you know, fee
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.680]   regime, that it'll no longer be an attractive proposition to be
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.280]   a real estate agent for maybe half a million to a million
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.040]   people over time that are agents today.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:45.400]   Yeah, you know, it's interesting this, the the sellers are going
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.600]   to be faced with buyers who just show up having seen something on
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.360]   Redfin and don't have a buyer's representation. And so they
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.920]   think, from the stuff I've been reading that the sellers agent
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.320]   might be pointing them to, hey, go to these services, and be
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.880]   acting as like one broker, essentially representing both
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.280]   sides. That's what people are saying is the potential downside.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.200]   I don't think that's good. Yeah, that's not going to happen for a
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.960]   couple of reasons. But let me ask you guys a question. If you
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.880]   guys wanted to go buy a new house, currently, you just go,
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.600]   you know, sign up an agent or buyer's agent, they go walk with
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.320]   you, and eventually they'll get paid by the seller's agent. So
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.840]   now you have to negotiate a fee with them up front. Would you
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.560]   negotiate a fee and say to a buyer's agent, hey, I'll pay you
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.840]   2% of whatever home I buy? Would you be comfortable doing that or
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.920]   3% or 4%? How would you have that conversation? No, you say
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.560]   sex? I mean, forget I know you've got a different
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.320]   situation. Because you've got real estate people like working
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.680]   for you. But like, if you were to go out and if would you go
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.280]   out and get an agent and pay and negotiate a fee with them?
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.320]   It is not worth it to the buyer to pay two to 3% of the purchase
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.400]   price to make appointments. You can see all the houses on MLS
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.400]   through Zillow or Redfin or whatever.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.360]   And what about handling closing and disclosures?
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.480]   No buyer would ever voluntarily agree to pay this massive
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.000]   commission. It's not worth it. So it's game over for the
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.200]   realtors. If buyers are forced to pay their own brokers
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.800]   commission. The only reason this system works is because the
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.080]   seller is forced to pay for it. Yeah. And when you sign the
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.360]   listing agreement with the seller's agent, you can
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.920]   negotiate a little bit at the margins. Sometimes you can get
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:30.360]   the 6% down to four to 5% for a big listing. But 50% of it will
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.000]   always go to the buy side. I mean, I've said to these guys,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.360]   the buy side agent doesn't do anything. Why don't you make it
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.520]   2% for yourself 1% for the buyer, they won't do that.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.040]   They just won't take your business, the seller will not
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:41.680]   represent you.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.120]   They have like all sorts of rules against it. So the whole
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.040]   thing is like, protect. It's like a racket that's protected.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.080]   And now it's been cracked. Yeah. Well, I still am like a little
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.400]   bit skeptical that this is going to work out exactly the way
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:57.480]   we're saying because it is just such a death blow to the
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.120]   industry if buyers are forced to pay their own commissions, their
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.760]   own buy side brokers commission. And in the articles, they're
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.920]   saying there's still like some gray area about what's going to
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.840]   happen. But that is what should happen. Buyers should be
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.040]   responsible for paying their own brokers. And if you do that, I
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.960]   think you'll knock out half the fees this industry.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.920]   Here's an idea. Want to charge an hourly fee as a buyer's agent
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.720]   like people doing that jk $200 an hour $300 an hour doesn't
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.600]   impact home prices as well. Like if you if the buyer had to pay
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.560]   all of a sudden their affordability effectively goes
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:33.520]   down because if they have to pay an extra $100,000 for a home,
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.680]   then that's $100,000 they can't pay less than they can pay for
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.040]   the house itself because they have to pay an agent. So but it
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.720]   all comes back into home prices. No,
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.800]   it nets out because the seller's agents no longer paying 6%,
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.760]   they're paying 3%. And so now the seller's agent has 3%
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.080]   more that that's your net, they'll take that's the same.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.160]   Yeah, but net net,
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.760]   I think it's good for buyers and sellers because the transaction
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.000]   costs of trading go down.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.320]   Exactly. The money goes back in consumers pockets, create a more
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.440]   fluid market. I think it's a great opportunity for startups.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.440]   I'll say this right now, like I think there's going to be a lot
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.560]   of startups that are going to come out of this ruling that are
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.000]   going to launch a la carte services leveraging AI to make
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.560]   these services available direct to consumers without needing an
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.120]   agent. And they're going to be pretty compelling services and
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.320]   they're going to show up real fast.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.840]   I mean, a lot of people will not list their home or sell it.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:28.000]   Because that 6% might put them underwater. So if it's now now
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.600]   down to two or three, totally. Yeah, people might be like,
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.560]   it's been crazy to me that anyone would pay a percent of
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.960]   absolute value. It makes no sense. I bought a home for a
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.480]   million. I'm selling it for 1,000,001. So I've made $100,000
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:46.760]   profit, but I got to pay $60,000 of my total gross to an agent to
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.880]   sell it for me. 60% of the profit, I just gave up 60% of my
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.400]   profit on my home. Right? It makes no sense.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.800]   And the crazy thing is that a bad sale of your home would be
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.080]   let's call it 900,000 or a million and a great sale would
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:05.680]   be 1.2. So exactly. It's a very small margin where they actually
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.520]   have an impact based on the quality of their effort, but
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.240]   they get compensated for the whole thing.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.400]   Yeah, for the whole thing, no matter what compensated no
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:18.200]   matter the out should be that you get a flat rate $10,000 at a
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.400]   million, and then you get 10% over a million or something you
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.520]   could give just like you might be a salesperson.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.880]   The incentive comp should be variable based on performance.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.720]   Whereas the guaranteed part of the comp should be like you said
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:36.400]   a flat fee. It's kind of like the salesperson has no T variable.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.240]   Yeah, I mean, you can say if you said 1% up to a million, so
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:45.320]   that's 10k and then 10% for the next 100k and then 20% for the
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.920]   next 100k. So you it's you know, that 1.2 million is really hard
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.880]   to get. Yeah, I'll give you 20% of that incremental 100 that
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.640]   would be a much better deal. You'll be getting paid for the
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.400]   actual performance. So really interesting.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.920]   You know, Jake, I have an idea for the National Association of
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.560]   Realtors.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.360]   Oh, here we go.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.400]   If they want to stop being perceived as an evil
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.760]   monopolist, all they got to do is put out a cringe ad talking
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.200]   about the environment. Everyone's gonna love them
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.200]   again. Absolutely. They should do an ad where they have a
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.960]   little cast of people. And that diverse cast could talk about
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.040]   like putting sustainable forestry around it.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.480]   All I got to do is say something something landfills. Everyone
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.520]   will love them again. They can charge
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.600]   absolutely, absolutely virtue signaling, right? They can
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.800]   change something landfills. Yes, absolutely. All right, let's
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.560]   keep the train moving here. The AI landscape shifting yet again,
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:37.280]   Microsoft is just did another one of these shadow aqua hires
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.120]   this time of inflection AI bizarre deal. Microsoft has
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.640]   hired most of the team at inflection AI including the CEO
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.720]   Mustafa, who everybody knows, I just actually had him on this
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.080]   weekend startups. He was the co founder of DeepMind. He worked
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.520]   at Google for years, and now he's going to be the CEO of a
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:00.240]   new company called Microsoft AI. It's essentially the consumer AI
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.920]   division of Microsoft, but they did give him the CEO title for
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.000]   background inflection have raised 1.5 billion over the last
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.880]   two years. It was one of these giant fundings that occurred to
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.880]   build a foundational model. Like open AI is doing like in
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.480]   traffic is doing. They had a chatbot called pi very similar
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.480]   to chat GPT was supposed to remember your history and build
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.080]   a relationship with you. That's all getting shut down. Reid
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.880]   Hoffman, who is a major investor in this company, and who's on
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.600]   the board of Microsoft, and who's so linked into Microsoft,
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.440]   and played an important role in this deal, according to reports
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   and the inflection investors included Bill Gates, Eric
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.040]   Schmitt, and a bunch of other interesting folks. But this was
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:45.240]   a acquire, which is the weird thing, Chamath, they hired all
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.080]   the employees, they leave the shell of a company, the company
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.480]   is going to go do some enterprise stuff. And investors
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.040]   get to keep their equity inflection. But I guess that
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.200]   might be worthless. There's something going on here that we
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.880]   don't know about this deal structure. When you saw this
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.360]   deal, and you see Satya taking the entire team, like he
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.640]   threatened to do with opening AI, if you remember, same exact
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.600]   kind of thing, I'll acquire everybody, if you don't take the
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.560]   deal, what is your take of what's going on here? Why did
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.400]   this occur like this, instead of just buying the company?
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.440]   I mean, it occurred like this, because read and bill are
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.520]   inexorably tied to Microsoft. So they were able to get a deal for
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.520]   investors that would have never happened otherwise. And so good
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.880]   on them. I think they did a very good job protecting the
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:36.440]   fiduciary interests of the investors of the startup sacks.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.560]   No conflict, no interest. Yeah. I mean, we say that a lot. This
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:43.560]   is so weird, though. Why not buy the company sacks? Is it because
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.400]   of antitrust?
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.480]   Actually, that's a good theory. It's just it's hard for
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.880]   Microsoft to get anything through at this point. So
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.920]   probably they're just like, why even deal with antitrust, they
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.760]   don't really need the assets. So I think they license the core
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.400]   tech from the inflection C Corp, and then they hire away all the
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.080]   talent. And then the investors get made whole. So I think it's
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.800]   like an aqua hire with a little bit of tech along with it that
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.760]   they get through the licensing deal. Maybe that's to protect
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.160]   them from an IP standpoint. My take on this is that this was a
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.400]   bailout. This was a bailout of the investors. I don't think
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.200]   investors got ripped off here. I think the investors were like
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.520]   thrilled to get their money back for whatever reason. This
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.920]   company wasn't going anywhere. It raised hundreds of millions
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.560]   of dollars. Reed and bill obviously are wired in there on
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.960]   the Microsoft board. And this company did have some talent
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.880]   that Microsoft wanted. So they basically did a giant aqua hire
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.280]   and it bailed out the investors.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.520]   freeberg. Is that your take? This is a bailout? Or do you
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.120]   think this is a new interesting and run around antitrust where,
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:50.440]   hey, if Adobe wants to buy the next Figma, just buy the team,
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:55.360]   do a license of Figma, some fakaka lunacy? Or do you think
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.520]   this is a ballot? What's your theory here? freeberg? What does
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.440]   it say about Microsoft's approach to the AI space?
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.800]   I don't think this is some run around antitrust. I think
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.640]   obviously, like a lot of companies, there's been a
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:13.000]   realization on how quickly foundational model development
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.600]   is commoditizing and how quickly costs are escalating. And how
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.720]   many folks are chasing it. So having some unique advantage in
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:25.160]   the particular plane of the market, where they were
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:30.240]   participating as a startup, maybe became difficult and
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.800]   untenable and negotiations and conversations between all these
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.920]   parties who all know each other very, very well, and are all
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.400]   very friendly. You know, this ended up being kind of the best
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.600]   way to move forward.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.480]   All right, there you have it, folks. In other related news,
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.040]   the Saudis are planning a $40 billion AI fund, according to
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:52.240]   the New York Times reps from the public investment fund in Saudi
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.840]   have spoken to a number of firms about partnering on it. This
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.440]   would be the second largest venture fund of all time behind
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.800]   softbanks $100 billion Vision Fund one, which you remember was
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.320]   also backed by the Saudis and some other folks in Middle East
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.400]   region, this new fund would reportedly invest in AI
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.120]   startups, chip companies and data centers. So we thought we
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.720]   do a little quiz here. If you were given the 40 billion David
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:22.240]   Sachs, how would you allocate the 40 billion in AI in today's
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.600]   market 2024 going on if they put you in charge of this $40
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.800]   billion a fund AI fund? Where would you deploy it? Same
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.480]   question will come around the horn to you freeberg. And then
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:32.960]   you come up?
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.840]   Well, the first thing is, I wouldn't be in a rush to deploy
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.680]   all 40 billion at once, because that's a recipe for spraying a
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.720]   lot of money into unproductive or overhyped things. So I would
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.640]   take my time, first of all. But second, in terms of kind of
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.640]   the framework, I would think about the different levels of
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.200]   the stack of AI and try to figure out where the value
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.920]   capture is going to be. And I think there's maybe four
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.240]   different layers of the stack. First, you've got this look on
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.640]   you've got the chips were Nvidia is dominant. Then you've got the
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.560]   foundation models where it's open AI, and then there's some
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.720]   open source models. And then you've got kind of infrastructure
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.280]   dev tools, vector databases, things like that. And then
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.280]   finally, you have the applications sitting on top of
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.000]   that, which are just getting started. I think it's really
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.880]   hard to know from what we're seeing today exactly who's going
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.160]   to capture the most value in the stack. I mean, you could make an
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.800]   argument for against pretty much any layer of the stack, I guess
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.240]   if I had 40 billion to deploy, what I would do is try to
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.680]   identify who are the leading companies at each level of the
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.800]   stack, and then who are the most promising challengers, and I
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.680]   would make a bet at every layer. So I'm covered. That's not what
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.120]   I personally do. Because I'm not, you know, I'm just not a
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.680]   hardware investor. I'm not really an infrastructure
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.600]   investor, I'm more of an application investor. So I'm
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.440]   going to focus on that fourth layer of the stack and just
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.960]   trust that there's gonna be enough value there. But again,
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:55.600]   if I was managing a $40 billion sovereign wealth fund, then I
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.000]   would play at every single level. And I would hire the best
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.280]   people who know each layer of that stack.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:04.160]   sacks me to do a good job of sort of showing the the four
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.560]   layers of the stack. I think open source, the application
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.800]   layer, and specifically robotics are huge opportunities that are
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.760]   under invested in right now. So I would take the top open source
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.040]   projects, I'd find those top contributors, take the top 20 or
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.600]   so open source projects, and back them to the tune of, you
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.160]   know, significant money, 50 million, 100 million, whatever
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.720]   it takes, and try to own the top 20, or have insights into those
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   top 20 open source models, and own those teams, look for the
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.320]   top contributors really easy to do on GitHub and hugging face
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.760]   and replete and other places where they're active and empower
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.800]   those. Then obviously, there's verticals, we're working on
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.120]   people who are doing screenplays and tax just like you are sacks,
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.120]   and that's a fantastic place to deploy money. But then I think
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:52.880]   robotics is going to be super, super compelling here. And that
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.200]   takes a lot of money. And so you do have the capital as a weapon.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:00.560]   And you know, the 20 year view of this and making a general
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.600]   person purpose robot like Elon's doing with optimists, or figure
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:09.440]   AI is doing with their robot. I think robotics is a major place
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.920]   you can probably buy, I don't know who owns Boston Dynamics.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.640]   Now I know Google sold it. So you can probably buy some
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:18.120]   robotic companies and then put the AI on them and really take a
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.680]   20 year view of robotics. Freeberg, your thoughts, how
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.800]   would you deploy the 40 million
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:31.040]   the autumn three stacks are very difficult right now to find a
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.400]   footing, obviously, you know, I think sacks the, you know, it's
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.040]   the I think the generally accepted framework for how to
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.200]   think about how the market is broken apart. But on the
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.040]   application side, I think is where you could think about
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:50.600]   finding more traditional business model advantages. So,
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.800]   you know, I think your point about robotics is a really
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.440]   interesting one, you know, is there a enterprise like sale of
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.840]   robotics tools that have positive ROI for enterprises?
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.240]   And is there a business that's working there and that is
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:06.760]   scalable vertical solutions in labor and automation and
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:11.600]   productivity gains are probably the best sharp ratio, good alpha
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:15.400]   lower beta, and a good place to kind of deploy competing and
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.600]   chips competing in infrastructure competing and
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.840]   models. It's such a, you know, as we just talked about with
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.760]   respect to what happened with inflection and Microsoft this
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.080]   week, it's such a rapidly changing environment. It's hard
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:31.520]   to have high confidence in where things are headed there. So I do
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.040]   think that we do know that there are enterprise markets, we know
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:38.600]   that there are segments of things like food, medicine, you
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:40.800]   know, manufacturing, these are markets that aren't going
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:45.160]   anywhere. And they could all certainly benefit from unlocks
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:48.800]   in software or in robotics and automation and hardware. So
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.640]   that's probably where I would think about concentrating
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:55.000]   capital. But you know, 40 billion is a lot of money. So
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.200]   you'd probably think about deploying it over what period of
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.800]   time is a 10 billion a year over four years. And then is it
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.440]   broken apart? And what way over those sectors and over what
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.920]   geographies and you know, then find good managers to help you
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.760]   get it deployed.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.160]   Jamal, you're batting clean up here, you got to hear
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.240]   everybody's answers. Before giving your own, what are your
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.760]   thoughts on your other besties answers and what's your plan to
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.960]   deploy 40 billion for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.000]   public investment fund.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.680]   The most important thing that fund managers get wrong is not
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.480]   having appropriate reserves for your winners. And if I look
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:35.840]   back, the real profit dollars that I leaked was not not
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.440]   investing enough upfront, but when I didn't have enough
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.920]   reserve to do the full pro rata, or even super pro rata and the
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.800]   ones that worked. So the first thing you have to do when I do
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.720]   the regression on all of my funds, you really need to
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:51.720]   reserve between 40 and 50% of a total fund size for reserve. So
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.160]   take 20 billion off the table. And now you have a smaller
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.400]   problem, which is how do you deploy 20 billion because the
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:01.000]   other 20 billion is purely meant for the winners, where you cram
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.520]   the money into the few that are winning so that you can make the
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.680]   most money of that 20 billion, I would probably take two thirds
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.520]   of it. And I would go to all the hyperscalers, and anybody that's
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:17.680]   providing cloud compute, and essentially buy out all of the
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.400]   compute credits on GPUs. So that I could tell any startup in the
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:27.800]   world, you will do a safe with me, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:32.400]   I will give you free compute on pick your cloud provider, pick
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:36.360]   your model, I don't care. So if you want to run llama on grok,
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.320]   great. If you want to run Mistral on GCP, great. If you
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:45.240]   want to run open AI on open AI, fantastic. But we will pay for
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:49.160]   all the compute in return, we get 7% upfront. And you have to
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:53.800]   tell us some benchmark of how this model is improving. And
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.640]   then you are hiring a team of people whose job it is, and you
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:01.640]   can probably train a model to do this as well, to ingest the
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:06.160]   reporting in a systematic way to understand if it is, as you guys
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.080]   said, a robotics company, there are measures of the quality of
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.680]   a robot, a robot's dexterity, or vision or manipulation or tax
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.280]   completion rate. If it's a search engine, it's a different
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.160]   thing. If it's a consumer facing app, it could be users, if it's
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:24.040]   a drug discovery app, it's the number of legitimate protein
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:30.120]   synthesis, passes that that pass, whatever it is. So now
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:33.480]   you've scoped the problem to 20 billion is in reserves, 15
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.160]   billion of it is tied up in credits. And then the 5 billion,
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.880]   I do think it's what David said, what SAC said, which is a
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.160]   billion and a half to the hardware, a billion and a half to
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.680]   infrastructure, a billion and a half to some of these discrete
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:49.920]   ideas. You probably need a 30 or 40 person team total no more.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:54.280]   But that business can could make a trillion dollars if it was set
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.000]   up that way. But the key is to get the credits out to people.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.320]   So that the reality is what the commonality across every single
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:06.360]   AI startup is that they will have to run on a model. And that
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.160]   model will be hosted somewhere in a cloud. And all of that
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.760]   compute will need to be paid for. So Saudi Arabia should pay
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:18.440]   for that compute, get six or 7% upfront, and re title the safe,
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.320]   not as the what is a safe call Jason
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:25.640]   simple agreement for future equity, there should be the
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:30.080]   Saudi Saudi agreement for future equity. I love it. That's what
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:34.600]   they said. Well, there you have it. And yes, the all in KSA $40
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:38.080]   billion fund, give us a call. We'll fire it up. And we'll
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.320]   deploy the 40 billion for you.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.800]   I can't, maybe. Actually, I'm curious, you guys, since
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.600]   everyone kind of seems to agree with the framework of the four
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:49.960]   levels of the stack, where do you guys think the value cap is
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.120]   going to be? Do you think it's going to be by the chip
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:56.440]   companies, the foundation model companies, the infrastructure
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.600]   companies or the or the applications?
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.040]   I'll actually change my answer in a little bit. I don't think
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.760]   it's necessarily new technology companies per se, that are going
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.120]   to benefit most. But I think that it's businesses in
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.960]   traditional industries that are going to be able to leverage
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:13.280]   these tools, whether they're using open source tools, or
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:16.040]   third party technology capabilities that they're buying
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.360]   as a service or as a piece of software. There's an incredible
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.080]   set of advances are going to be realized in things like chemical
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:26.840]   manufacturing, drugs, general manufacturing that have existing
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.680]   scale and infrastructure that are the fastest to move to adopt
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.840]   these technologies are going to benefit the most. And I think
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.520]   that's probably where most of the value will accrue is not
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.200]   necessarily a chip company, but in other businesses and
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:44.000]   traditional industries that can transform themselves using AI.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.640]   So your answer is that the application and then within
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.840]   application level, you could divide it up between existing
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.800]   companies and startups. Yeah. And existing companies that are
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:56.760]   able to leverage AI innovations that are lower in the stack.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:00.680]   Another way to answer your question, saxes, which is the
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:03.280]   most crap, which spaces are the most crowded already. And so
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.600]   obviously, chips are super crowded, lots of incumbents,
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.280]   lots of people going after it. And the foundation models are
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:13.200]   very crowded as well. And the application level is yet to sort
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.760]   of be built out, right, because we're in year zero or year one
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.160]   of that. So I do think application levels where there's
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:22.800]   a lot of value, but I also think the hosting and the development
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.240]   of these various niche models is going to be a huge opportunity.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.080]   So just once again, those open source models, being put into
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:33.720]   cloud computing environments and optimized, that could be a whole
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:39.240]   new level of AWS is in Google Cloud, and Azure's. So there's
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:42.840]   an opportunity for somebody to compete with those incumbents by
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:46.720]   just being better at those models that are open source and
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.960]   having the team that's doing those updates, and then
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.480]   optimizing that cloud. So I would go with the cloud level
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.440]   for those open source models and providing that as a service like
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.960]   VMware does or other folks do. WordPress will be a tiny example
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.800]   of an open source project like that. And then I just something
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.640]   tells me this robotic space, which has been a false start
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.920]   over and over and over again. I think this is the time where
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:13.040]   actually it's going to work. And so I'm, I love that hardware
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:13.960]   robotics space.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.000]   I think you're right, sex. I think it's kind of bookended in
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.800]   my mind. I think the the folks that are building fundamental
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.320]   hardware will make a lot of money over the next five to 10
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.080]   years. And then the folks that are building the fundamental
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.480]   application level experiences will make a lot of money as
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.760]   well. And then, who knows? The thing that we're not talking
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.240]   about enough, and I don't understand it well enough is the
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.160]   entire way in which apps are built needs to fundamentally be
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.680]   rethought from first principles, because you essentially
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:48.160]   basically have these client server apps, where you have all
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.040]   of this business logic that's sitting back in some server
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.520]   somewhere. And I don't think that that's how apps get built
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.080]   today, in a world of AI. And so it doesn't need to work that
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.400]   way. So I don't exactly know what that means. But it, it
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.360]   just seems like most of the architecture of how the
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.520]   internet works today doesn't make much sense. So that would
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.040]   then support freebrook's point that all of the kind of the
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.440]   legacy things that we all know and trust also get rebuilt. And
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.800]   so that could create an entire wave where networking value gets
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.080]   recreated and everything. So my gosh, I mean, it could be very,
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.000]   very transformational.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.480]   I mean, the idea that you would just talk to a computer or in a
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.240]   chat interface, and you wouldn't use an app interface, you would
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.120]   just ask it questions that would give you answers, ask you
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.240]   questions, it gives you answers, give it a task, it gives you a
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.720]   result. This is very compelling. This is why like Saudi needs to
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.720]   basically make a bet that there's just developers that are
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.680]   swarming around ideas, let them show you what's happening,
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.840]   because paying 800 million a year of fees is not the best
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.040]   way to generate a return on $40 billion. If this is where you
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.400]   want to be investing, I don't think yeah, 800 million could
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.920]   pay for a lot of credits, which probably gets you one step
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.800]   closer to the to the answer.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.600]   Or read it when public today, they have 800 million in
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:07.640]   revenue. Company is worth over $8 billion in trading, it's a 50%.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.520]   What do you think? Chamath is this the opening of the IPO
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.440]   window again? So so one off gets tribe coming? And what do you
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.440]   take from it popping 50% on the first day?
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.320]   I don't know. I really haven't looked at the company. I haven't
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.640]   looked at the financials. But like this last three or four
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:31.000]   weeks, I think people have been so excited and rearing to go.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   We're in the middle of another meme coin craze.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   We are all getting pulled into that nonsense.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.840]   I think the point is that I think there is a speculative
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.560]   party going on right now. And I'm not saying that Reddit is
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.160]   part of it. But whenever these things are so mispriced, just
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.280]   means that people are ready to gamble a little bit.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:57.560]   There's definitely a lot of gambling in the system, as we've
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.480]   seen. And we're recording this on Thursday. So who knows what
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.320]   the stock price will be tomorrow? Generally, I mean,
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.200]   the other thing is, like, Powell did say, finally, it looks
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.320]   pretty likely we're going to get these three cuts. So we're going
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:16.600]   to be down to four and a half to 475 unfed funds by the end of
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:21.120]   the year. It probably means that we'll get another 50 to 75 basis
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.360]   points to 2025. So people will look out to the end of 2025 and
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.000]   look at a fed funds rate that's sort of like 375 to 4%. So
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.880]   they're getting pretty excited and frothed up. So this is the
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.920]   beginning of the beginning in terms of that kind of
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.720]   speculation.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.160]   Yeah, we saw crypto go bonkers the last couple of weeks. Yeah.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.960]   What's your take on all this sacks? Is does it feel like
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:49.640]   people are in gamble mode again? And does that concern you? I
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.520]   guess after what we just experienced?
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.720]   Well, I think they're pricing in these rate cuts as if they're
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.160]   definitely going to happen. Like Jamal said, I think the markets
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:04.000]   expectation is with let's call it 70% certainty that you're
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.520]   gonna get three rate cuts this year. And it still seems to me
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.840]   that that's a little bit up in the air. Because inflation has
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.960]   not come down to the Fed's target of 2%. It's still right
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.760]   around 3%, 3.1%. So it's been sticky around 3%. It was coming
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.520]   down pretty fast last year, but it's still there. So people I
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.400]   think are maybe gambling in the sense that they're counting on
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.160]   rate cuts that haven't happened yet. But they liked pals dovish
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.880]   rhetoric yesterday. And they seem to think that that means
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.760]   that the rate cuts are definitely coming. I don't know
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.920]   how pal can promise that without inflation coming down unless
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.520]   he's trying to create a Biden put. There it is, folks, which
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:52.200]   was my theory going into this year. Is that yeah. Biden put
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:52.840]   from the Fed.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:56.200]   Absolutely. And it's looking like Biden has a clear path to
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.880]   victory based on the lowest unemployment of our lifetimes
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.320]   and this warring stock market records. Yeah, it's a easy Biden
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:11.240]   victory. Friedberg, what do you think? About the risk on? I
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:11.600]   don't know.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.100]   Biden is incredibly unpopular. If you look at his actual
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.720]   polling, he should not win the election. But that's in spite
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.400]   of your right, the economy is seems to be doing pretty well.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.760]   And the stock market certainly doing pretty well. A president
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.640]   with these fundamentals would normally get reelected. But
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.840]   Biden currently is not his polling is not the polling of a
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.960]   president who's gonna get reelected. It is. But if pal
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960]   comes through with the rate cuts that will help him.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.800]   It's pretty amazing how horrible a job he's doing that he's made
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.640]   Trump look like a better candidate to some people. That is
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.560]   an extraordinary achievement by Biden. I will have to agree.
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.080]   There.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.280]   Look, I think the the bigger economic issue to be talking
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.920]   about was that buried article in the Wall Street Journal about
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.040]   commercial real estate. Do you see that article? That was
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.120]   crazy. So this Wall Street Journal article reported that of
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:07.840]   the 36 billion of office loans that came due in the commercial
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.480]   mortgage backed securities market last year, only one
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:15.080]   quarter were paid off in full. That's according to data from
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.080]   real estate analytics firm cred 10.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.880]   Is that extended pretend strategy that you see there?
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:23.680]   Oh, yeah. I mean, only one quarter of the loans got paid
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:28.080]   off. So 75% didn't get paid off in full. So there's tons of
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.080]   buildings that are underwater right now. But nobody wants to
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:36.160]   foreclose and then sell them at a fire sale price. So yeah,
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.320]   everyone is it's pretend and extend.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.720]   Yeah, kicking the can down the road. Nobody wants to take the
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.560]   medicine. So yeah,
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.680]   well, they're hoping they're hoping that rates will come down
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.520]   fast enough and occupancy rates will go up fast enough that no
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:52.320]   one has to foreclose. But if rates don't come down, then you
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.720]   have a real problem. And again, everyone is just assuming that
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.840]   inflation will continue its path from 3% to 2%. And then we'll
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.880]   get these rate cuts. And they're hoping they can cling on
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.760]   landlords are clinging on. And I think the banks that loan them
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:10.880]   all this money are clinging on for dear life. But if rates stay
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.480]   higher longer, then you're gonna see some real distress. Yeah,
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.240]   including the regional banking system.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.560]   Freeberg, you had a science corner here, a couple of
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.280]   different things came up the Hubble telescope, 3d printed
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.480]   organs, where do you want to go with this?
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.680]   I mean, do you guys want to talk about how the universe is
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.560]   expanding at an accelerating rate and expanding
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.120]   differentially everywhere we look and we don't understand how
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.840]   or why 100% and sacks needs to use the loo. So yeah, definitely.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:47.280]   Love science quarter. Let's do it. Freeberg, it's your time to
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.160]   sign to shine. Oh, science. Tell us what's going on with the
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:55.960]   universe. My favorite topic. astrophysics. My favorite, my
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.320]   favorite. So back to Texas back. Are we headed for Uranus?
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:04.120]   Dead set on it. We're dead. It's a collision course. He
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.880]   disappeared. He's just gonna drop in and do a Uranus jokes. I
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:11.640]   hear him giggling with his he's with his writers. He's he just
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.520]   went to the writers room to get an update on the Uranus jokes.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:20.280]   It's long been known that our universe is expanding. We've all
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:26.440]   heard about the the Big Bang Theory. And a couple decades
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:33.840]   ago, scientists began to observe the brightness of supernovae or
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:37.880]   exploding stars. And then by looking at their brightness, we
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.640]   could tell how far away they were. And then looking at the
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.240]   shift of the light, whether it's getting red or blue, you can
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.960]   tell whether the light the supernova is moving away from us
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:53.520]   or towards us and how quickly. And so what scientists have used
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:57.200]   those observations to deduce several decades ago, and for
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.440]   which a group won the Nobel Prize, is that our universe is
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:06.040]   expanding, meaning that everything is moving away from
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.280]   itself. It's almost as if we're all in a cake. The best analogy
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.000]   I've heard is that there's raisins in the cake. And as the
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.840]   cake expands in the oven, all of those raisins look around, and
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.360]   they're all moving apart from each other. So the distance
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:23.880]   between everything is getting wider, space is expanding. And
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:27.120]   so we can actually roll moment of the Big Bang. That's the
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.360]   theory is right. This all started in the Big Bang. And
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.440]   it's not like, you know, we're all in the middle of the
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.840]   universe, and the universe is moving away from us. It's that
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.680]   the entire entirety of space is expanding itself. And so
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.560]   everything is moving away from everything else. The challenge
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.520]   in the data was that recently, we saw that different types of
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:49.120]   stars that were observed with the Hubble Space Telescope had
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.160]   actually a different rate of expansion of the universe than
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.120]   was previously thought from the supernova that we saw. And
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.760]   everyone thought there was something wrong with the Hubble
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.000]   Space Telescope data. So, you know, in a final print published
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.560]   last month, the James Webb Space Telescope, which showed much
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.920]   higher resolution of imaging, and as a result, much better
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.000]   data. Here's an image of it, you can just see the difference
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.320]   between what came out of James Webb, and what was used in
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.440]   Hubble. So that shows one star that was used to calculate the
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.600]   rate of expansion of the universe. And what the star
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.240]   showed is that the rate of expansion of the universe as
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.440]   measured across 1000 of these stars called Cepheid stars in
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.920]   five different galaxies, had a value that didn't match the
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.440]   value that we see when we look at exploding stars very far
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.600]   away. And so it once again, confirms what the original
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.560]   Hubble data showed, which is that the universe is expanding
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.520]   at different rates in different parts of the universe, which
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.480]   totally doesn't make sense. And there's no really clear answer
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.760]   as to the physics of why, if there was a Big Bang, and the
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.320]   universe started to expand, it should be expanding the same
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.600]   everywhere. There's no reason that different parts of the
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.200]   universe should be expanding at a different rate than other
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.520]   parts of the universe that there's differential expansion
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.680]   happening across the universe. And it really tells us that
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.840]   there's very little we know or understand about this large
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.280]   scale structure of the universe and why these things are
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.760]   happening. There was one group that put out a theory where they
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.800]   said that the local universe where we see these Cepheid stars
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.560]   that this data is based on, there's almost like a little
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:28.160]   bubble. And on the outside of the bubble, there's galaxies,
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.680]   and they're pulling stuff out faster than what's happening
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.880]   where there's not as much density. So there's a lot of
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.760]   different reasons and explanations for why this might
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.240]   be happening. But it's kind of a big story, because it basically
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.760]   confirms that we see a lot of differential expansion happening
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.680]   across the universe. And we don't know why. Just another big
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.200]   mystery of the universe. So super kind of interesting
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.600]   confirmatory data from James Webb this week. Do you want to
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.640]   talk about the, the pig kidney?
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.280]   I mean, I think it's, it's really incredible. They took a
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.880]   kidney from a pig, and then they use CRISPR cas nine to edit out
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.080]   the certain subset of the pig genes and edit in a certain
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:11.040]   useful subset of human genes. And then they transplanted that
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:16.440]   kidney into a 64 year old man. I said, and he apparently seems to
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.880]   be doing well. It's really incredible. And this is a guy
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:24.160]   that was at end stage kidney disease. And my father went
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.400]   through this. But when you're at that end stage renal disease,
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:32.320]   you're getting dialyzed every three days, for up to four or
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:36.200]   five, six hours, trying to basically have a machine that
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.520]   does the job the kidneys for you to keep your blood clean. But
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.160]   it's just it's kind of a death sentence. And it's like a slow
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.120]   moving death sentence at that. So the idea that you could now
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:55.200]   use this effectively infinite source of organs seems really
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.400]   compelling. Pretty amazing. I don't know what do you think?
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:06.360]   Definitely where we're headed. I don't even see. Yeah. Speaking
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.880]   of medical breakthroughs. Did you guys see the guy who got the
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:16.120]   neural link chip with his brain? He's using the force. Yeah. That
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.400]   was also the force. Yeah, he described it as he was playing
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.400]   chess. And he said, like, I love playing chess. And I've learned
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.960]   to use my mind to move pieces around. And he said, like, it's
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:29.920]   like having the force. I mean, wow, amazing. I watched the live
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.440]   stream. And he said that he was a quadriplegic from the
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.960]   shoulders down. But he loves chess. He wasn't able to play
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.800]   chess. Now he's able to play chess. He was able to play
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:42.320]   civilization, the game, which I guess was really hard. In the
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.800]   absence of having this, this chip, and now he can do that.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.600]   It's incredible. I mean, it's really cool that they kind of
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.560]   went public with it. Or I mean, obviously, he agreed to go
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.680]   public with it. I think Trevor was his name. It's pretty
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.200]   amazing. And there's more amazing stuff coming. They're
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.800]   making significant progress over there. I was talking to somebody
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:05.160]   who works there. And, you know, it's, it's, it's going to be.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:10.240]   Yeah, it's going to be a process, but they're making
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.280]   significant progress, and they're going to have, I think,
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.800]   even bigger announcements in the coming year. They're getting it
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.120]   done.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.960]   My kids were really blown away by it. You know, it's, it's
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.360]   interesting to me what like penetrates their cynicism bubble
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.000]   and like what they get actually impressed or excited by and they
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.120]   thought this was really cool.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:33.000]   You know, it's so funny. It's like people are breathlessly
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.520]   like, looking at the Elon Don Lemon video, and they're trying
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.280]   to opine whether he had a good interview or a bad interview.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.840]   And it's like, he actually had one of the best weeks of his
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.720]   life. Yeah, Starship three made it up. Yeah, Starship had an
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:52.360]   incredible performance last week. And then this thing this
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.960]   week. I mean, what an incredible seven day run. It's more than
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.680]   most of us will have in our lifetime. It's also not so
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.520]   crazy. That Don Lemon interview, like there was actually some
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.240]   really interesting topics discussed. But I felt like this
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.280]   was like, this was the perfect like, baton passing between old
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:12.240]   media and new media where he was constantly trying to do a gotcha
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.600]   journalism thing. And you know, I was trying to engage in good
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.320]   faith and like an interesting discussion. And then every time
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.160]   the discussion got interesting. He kept trying to go back to
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.560]   like, sensational gotcha journalism, and it was a totally
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.000]   wasted opportunity if he had just gone lemon, I just stayed
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.600]   in the moment. And like engaged in good faith, instead of trying
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.040]   to get this like, clip, it was a really bad performance by Don
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.680]   Lemon, I thought it was really getting interesting at moments
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.280]   in time. He's obviously trying to get a job back at some
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:45.120]   mainstream media company. Maybe this is his. This is his resume.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.680]   If he can basically get some clip of Elon saying something
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.760]   that he can twist into something that it doesn't mean. And you
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.520]   can say I got Elon Musk, then he can get his job back at CNN or
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.480]   one of those paid out in full, like 20 30 million bucks. And by
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.840]   the way, those jobs are not they don't exist anymore. Like Tucker
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.480]   and him were like the last of that generation to get those
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.680]   huge paydays. Don Lemon got paid $30 million by whom? I think
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.240]   CNN, the report was CNN paid out his full contract. The same
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.320]   thing happened, I think with Tucker, they both got paid their
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.880]   full contracts, whoever negotiates those contracts with
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:23.840]   the networks over the last couple of decades is awesome,
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:28.600]   because it's pay, it's pay for play, like, whether you are on
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.520]   air or not, you get paid. And the and then they don't let you
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:34.560]   go to a competitor. That's why both of them are doing internet
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.960]   stuff. x or whatever carved out stuff. Just wanted to give a
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.560]   shout out here at the end of the pod for the guys that all in
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:44.760]   talk, Chris and Spencer did an amazing job the team over there
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.280]   from good future media of creating just that amazing fan
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.360]   account. Now that we're growing up here over at all in and we'll
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.320]   have a CEO announcement at some point. We have taken over the
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:58.320]   accounts and we're starting to make our own clips. So thanks to

[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.880]   Love you boys, world's greatest moderator. You forgot your
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.400]   timeline.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.240]   And the host of This Week in Startups. So search for my
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.640]   podcast, This Week in Startups, where I interview startup
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.680]   founders. Gotta get a plug in for that. No, some people don't
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.320]   know I have another podcast. So please search for This Week in
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.000]   Startups and subscribe to that as well. We'll see you all next
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:18.880]   time. Bye bye.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:19.560]   Love you boys.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.320]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.160]   Rain Man, David Sachs.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:31.800]   We open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.000]   it.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.040]   Love you, Wesley.
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.480]   Queen of Kinwa.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:42.240]   Besties are gone.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:46.400]   That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway, Sachs.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.600]   Oh, man.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.240]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.080]   because they're all just useless. It's like this like
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.320]   sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:03.160]   Wet your BB. Wet your BB.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.000]   We need to get merch.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:06.520]   Besties are gone.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.120]   I'm doing all in.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:16.120]   I'm doing all in.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.700]   (upbeat music)
