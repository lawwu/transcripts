[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.740]   - Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.300]   This episode was hosted by
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.840]   the Pre and Early Retirement Life Stage Chapter
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.520]   and recorded on December 13th, 2023.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.280]   The session features Lonnie Thibodeau
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.160]   reviewing Medicare basics, followed by a Q&A session.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.860]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.400]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.820]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.900]   and should not be construed
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.860]   as personalized investment advice.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.220]   Could you walk us through how you initially
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.680]   entered the business of Medicare insurance
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.260]   after having worked in aviation?
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.640]   What inspired you to pursue this field?
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.400]   And were there any specific experiences or individuals
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.320]   that played a significant role
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.240]   in guiding you along the way?
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.480]   - Well, first, thanks for having me back again.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.480]   I'm honored to be here.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.680]   Thanks for the question.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.280]   Yeah, I'd spent about 17, 18 years
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.560]   in the corporate aviation business in a sales role
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.500]   of different capacities.
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.800]   And September 1, 2011 happened.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.800]   I'd been working on a special project
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.320]   for the company that employed me.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.920]   And that project included contacting people
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.840]   in countries like Japan, Australia, Europe, South America.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.260]   We were starting to develop a market
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.920]   for some of the things that we did.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.080]   And my boss came to me one day and said,
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.280]   "Hey, you and I need to get on the road."
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.120]   I said, "Where are we going?"
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.080]   He said, "Well, Japan, Australia, South America, Europe."
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.480]   And I said, "Bill, love you like a brother,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.720]   knowing you a long time, but not going over there."
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.960]   So I came home that evening and I told my wife,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.920]   "I need to find something else to do for a living."
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.040]   I was kind of tired of being a road warrior anyway.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.800]   So she said, "What do you want to do?"
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.440]   I said, "You know, back very early in our married life,
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.480]   I'd been laid off from an aviation job.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.840]   I was down in South Louisiana
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.200]   where the oil industry was collapsing.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.000]   And I did insurance just on a whim for a couple of years
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.800]   just to pay the bills."
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.640]   And so I said, "You know, I don't think I gave it
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.600]   a fair shake at that time.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.680]   So I'm going to try that again."
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.400]   So I got licensed in the state of Texas where I now live
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.260]   and started selling some things, health insurance primarily.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.880]   Ended up meeting a gentleman who was a rep for a company
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.920]   who trained agents to sell their product.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.560]   And he said, "Hey, I'm currently under consideration
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.440]   for a promotion.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.760]   If I were to get that promotion,
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.160]   would you have interest in doing my job?"
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.320]   I said, "Certainly, give me a call if that happens."
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.560]   So three or four weeks later, he calls,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.680]   interviewed for the job, took the job,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.240]   and worked for that company for just about five years.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.320]   And when a couple who owned this insurance agency
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.000]   was about ready to retire,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.080]   and they approached me about purchasing their business.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.960]   So that happened in March of 2007.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.080]   And we've been doing this ever since.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.600]   And I think my real interest in Medicare products
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.040]   was because as a kid,
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.240]   I spent a great deal of time with my grandparents.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.040]   So I spoke old long before I was old.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.560]   My wife has told me many times,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.380]   she says, "You were old before your time."
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.080]   And I am guilty as charged.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.000]   - Got it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.760]   Excellent, thanks for sharing that.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.200]   I'll also add, Lonnie's kind enough to agree
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.800]   to a part two session,
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.320]   since it's unlikely that we'll get to all of the questions.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.720]   So more to come on that,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.440]   it may be in a month or two or three,
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.400]   and it'll be announced on the forum
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.720]   and other channels as we typically do.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.520]   So again, Lonnie, thanks for that background.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.680]   Next question, "Can you share with us
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.560]   what you enjoy most about your role
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.400]   in selling and recommending Medicare insurance products?
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.060]   Can you relate and experience
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.960]   where you feel your recommendations
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.840]   really help somebody avoid a mistake?"
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   - Well, first of all, I just help,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.120]   I like helping people solve the problems
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.800]   or answering the questions.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.520]   In essence, finding the solution
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.500]   that fits their situation exactly.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.160]   And as far as avoiding a mistake,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.640]   I'm not sure this is a direct answer to your question,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.920]   but I have to share an experience with you.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.520]   This past July, I had a gentleman come in
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.900]   and I shared with him how Medicare works
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.480]   answered his questions,
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.320]   explained that there's two major ways
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.460]   to get his Medicare benefits,
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.700]   either through original Medicare with a supplement
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.200]   or Medicare Advantage plan.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.640]   And after the presentation
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.880]   and answering all his questions,
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   he looked and he said,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.600]   "Well, I want a Medicare supplement plan.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.000]   Why would anybody want Medicare Advantage?"
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.040]   And I said, "Great."
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.720]   So we got him enrolled.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.120]   The very next day, I had a Denver gentleman,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.820]   exact same situation, about to turn 65, enroll in Medicare,
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.240]   gave the same presentation, answered all his questions.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.960]   And at the end of it, almost word for word,
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.360]   he said the same thing the prior gentleman said,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.880]   "Well, I want Medicare Advantage.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.080]   Why would anybody want Medicare supplement?"
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.820]   So my point being,
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.200]   we all have different wants, needs, priorities,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.400]   and those kinds of things.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.020]   And it's all about helping people get into the plan
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.780]   that fits their situation for them.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.840]   - Okay, great, thank you.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.080]   Next question.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.640]   Can you tell us about the book "Medicare and You"
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.680]   that you recommended last year?
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.080]   And by the way, for the audience,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.640]   a link to that PDF will be put in the chat.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.960]   - Yeah, so "Medicare and You" is typically mailed
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.600]   to anybody who's on Medicare once a year,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.840]   and it updates you with all the Medicare Part A,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.440]   Part B deductibles, premiums, those kinds of things.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.720]   And it is the Bible of Medicare.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.120]   If you will read that book from cover to cover,
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.600]   it will do two things for you.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.520]   It will give you a pretty clear understanding of Medicare,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.360]   and it will probably cure insomnia.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.240]   - Fantastic.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.300]   With that, Miriam, do you want to start us
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.140]   with a question from the RSVP or chat?
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.960]   - Yes, actually, the first question is my question.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.580]   And along with what Lonnie just said,
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.760]   Medicare Advantage, Medicare supplement,
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.760]   my question is, why would somebody wish traditional Medicare
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.880]   or original Medicare rather than the supplement
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.080]   or the Advantage plan?
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.200]   What is the advantage of, or what is the,
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.640]   why is original Medicare good for some people?
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.280]   - Okay. - What's the advantage?
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.760]   - Yep, great question.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.700]   So with original Medicare,
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.320]   there are no networks of doctors or hospitals
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.240]   to be concerned with.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.360]   You can go to any medical provider
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   anywhere in the United States who accepts Medicare.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.240]   And if you have a Medicare supplement plan along with that,
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.600]   then the same is true of your Medicare supplement plan.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.520]   So for people who might travel a lot
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.280]   or people who want extreme flexibility
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.720]   in using the Mayo Clinic versus using a hospital in Houston
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.240]   versus using somebody in Florida,
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.720]   Medicare along with a supplement
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.560]   is probably the right answer for you.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.520]   - That would be the primary reason for original Medicare
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.880]   or traditional Medicare.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.000]   - Correct. - Right.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.240]   The availability of doctors and networks and hospitals
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.400]   and that you can go to.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.800]   - That's exactly right.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.120]   - Okay, I might just mention
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.280]   that I do have traditional Medicare and the,
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.360]   which pays for 80%.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.080]   And then the other 20% that we use came from our employer.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   So we have employer retiree insurance for the other 20%.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.680]   - Very good.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.880]   - Is that considered,
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.880]   so I just might point out that people should look
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.720]   for their employer retiree insurance
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.800]   that many employers may offer it.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.560]   And for us, it was a good idea.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.080]   Is it called traditional Medicare or original?
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.320]   What is the correct word there?
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.280]   - Well, thanks for the question.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.840]   I oftentimes refer to it as traditional Medicare
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.880]   but it is technically correct to say original Medicare.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.840]   - Thank you.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.680]   Okay, Gorrie.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.080]   - Great, thanks Miriam and Lonnie.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.080]   Next question.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.080]   Let's say I chose the wrong plans for my situation.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.640]   When can I change?
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.800]   Say I'm not happy with the network provided
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   in my Medicare Advantage plan.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.280]   Let's say I'm healthy
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.920]   and chose an inexpensive Medicare Advantage
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.840]   and developed cancer.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.440]   What are my options?
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.640]   What personal experiences can you mention about this?
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.040]   For example, the story about your client
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.920]   that had MA for many years and then developed cancer.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.440]   - Yeah, so a great question.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.000]   And I'll provide maybe a scenario.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.240]   Let's say someone has turned 65 recently.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.760]   They've enrolled in Medicare part A, part B,
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.720]   the first of the month that they turned 65
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.480]   and they've chosen a Medicare Advantage plan.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.120]   So if you choose that route initially,
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.880]   then you have what's called a 12-month trial period.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.480]   And what that means to you is,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.400]   if at any time in that 12 months you decide,
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.480]   I've made a mistake in selecting a Medicare Advantage plan,
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.160]   I wish I'd chosen Medicare along with a supplement plan.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.600]   Well, during the trial period,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.360]   you can choose original Medicare
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.920]   along with a supplement plan
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.400]   and get what's called guaranteed issue.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.720]   And you would be able to choose
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.960]   from a number of standardized Medicare supplement plans
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.600]   issued or offered by any company
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.160]   that offers them in the zip code that you reside in.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.240]   Now, if on the other hand,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.880]   you chose Medicare supplement
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.960]   when you first enrolled in Medicare
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.560]   and then subsequently decided,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.680]   oh, I think I would rather have a Medicare Advantage plan,
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.120]   then in all likelihood,
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.280]   you will probably have to wait
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.640]   until the next annual enrollment period.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.080]   And that enrollment period runs from October 15
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.360]   through December 7, every calendar year.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.400]   Does that answer the question?
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.240]   - I believe so.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.480]   And then the personal example?
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.120]   - Yeah, so we,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.080]   my memory's foggy,
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.720]   but we've had a client or have a client
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.240]   who was enrolled in a Medicare supplement plan
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.120]   and the supplement plan premiums were getting really high.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.480]   And she came to me during the enrollment period and said,
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.840]   I don't think I can afford to pay these premiums any longer.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.480]   What are my options?
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.480]   So we talked about Medicare Advantage,
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.720]   the pros and the cons.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   And she said, well, are my doctors in network?
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.080]   So we confirmed that the doctors
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.120]   she wanted to see are indeed in network.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.520]   But she was concerned then about the co-pays
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.040]   and potential out-of-pocket maximums.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.560]   Well, it turns out in our area,
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.960]   we have a Medicare Advantage plan
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.200]   that has approximately $195 monthly premium,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.920]   but the co-pays for all your medical care are zero.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.600]   So it's a Medicare Advantage plan that does have a network,
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.360]   but from a coverage standpoint,
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.160]   it behaves more like a Medicare supplement plan.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.880]   And the premium she's paying for that
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.080]   ended up being about half what she was paying
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.480]   on her Medicare supplement plan.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.560]   So it turned out to be a great solution for her.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.440]   She's been enrolled in that plan now about four years
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.440]   and at the last review
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.040]   during this most recent enrollment period,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.760]   it still seems to be something that's working well for her.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.920]   - Great, thank you.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.440]   So the next question, and I'll add to it.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.600]   So the first part is,
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.240]   what are the most asked questions by your clients?
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.840]   And I'll add to it, what do clients find most confusing?
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.280]   I know there's a tremendous volume of information,
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.000]   a lot of it's confusing.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.680]   So if you can highlight what's most confusing
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.040]   and supplemental to that,
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.960]   what helps clarify most effectively
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   those most confusing things?
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.800]   - Yeah, good question.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.160]   So we've had a number of clients come in
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.560]   this past enrollment period
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.760]   and with a smirkish smile on their faces ask,
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.840]   am I getting all the benefits that I'm entitled to?
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.320]   And that's being driven by all the advertising
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.800]   for Medicare Advantage plans,
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.240]   because that's one of the taglines
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.560]   of one of the nationwide commercials, I think.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.520]   So jokingly, that's it.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.200]   What's one of the most confusing things,
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.120]   I think is the enrollment periods,
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.320]   because the annual enrollment period
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   that I just talked about,
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.760]   that runs from October 15th through December 7th,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.640]   applies to Medicare prescription drug plans
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.320]   and to Medicare Advantage plans,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.840]   but it does not apply to Medicare supplement plans.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.120]   In addition to that, we have another enrollment period
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.360]   we're about to approach,
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.280]   and it runs from January 1 to March the 31st.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   And that enrollment period
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.880]   is called the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.440]   And it only applies to people
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.000]   who are currently enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.280]   But that enrollment period allows them to change
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.680]   from one Medicare Advantage plan to another,
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.240]   or allows them to go back to original Medicare,
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.160]   select a Medicare supplement plan,
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.640]   and then select a Medicare prescription drug plan.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.000]   So the other thing we have are special enrollment periods.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.120]   So if you moved out of a service area
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.760]   for the plan you're currently enrolled in,
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.760]   oftentimes that opens up a special enrollment period for you
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.680]   based on your particular situation.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.800]   So just keeping the enrollment periods,
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.160]   I guess all straight,
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.200]   seems to be the most confusing thing for most people
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.920]   because there are a lot of moving parts, I think.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.560]   - Got it, okay, that was helpful.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.720]   Here's an interesting one.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.480]   I just started kindergarten.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.800]   Is it too early to start learning about Medicare?
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.680]   I made that up.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.400]   Okay, next real question.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.760]   I've had significant illnesses.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.600]   Are there any preexisting conditions or limits
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.040]   on any of the plans you'll be discussing?
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.560]   - Okay, so for Medicare Advantage plans,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.280]   they cannot eliminate coverage
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.000]   or charge you any higher premiums
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.760]   or fail to offer you coverage
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.520]   for any Medicare Advantage plan nationwide.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.240]   On Medicare supplement plans,
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.040]   when you're in your Medicare supplement
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.520]   open enrollment period, and let me explain,
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.000]   that happens the first of the month that you turn 65,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.600]   or let me back up.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.760]   Technically it happens
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.080]   when you first enroll in Medicare Part B,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.680]   and that gives you a six-month
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.320]   Medicare supplement open enrollment period.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.760]   And that means that you can apply
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.240]   for any Medicare supplement plan
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.280]   that's offered in the zip code that you reside in.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.040]   Now, there are some Medicare supplement plans
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.400]   that have what's called a preexisting condition clause.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.800]   And what that means is,
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.960]   is that they won't cover a preexisting medical condition
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.360]   for the first six months you're covered in the plan
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.880]   unless you had creditable health insurance coverage
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.760]   prior to enrolling in that Medicare supplement plan.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.680]   Now, most Medicare supplement plans
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.960]   have done away with that preexisting condition clause,
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.360]   but there are still some states,
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.440]   Texas being one of those,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.040]   where companies can have that clause
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.520]   as a part of their contract.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.720]   So just be sure you ask the question,
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.200]   especially if you don't currently have health insurance
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.880]   and you're enrolling in a Medicare supplement plan
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.960]   for the first time.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.320]   And again, in summary, Medicare Advantage plans,
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.600]   that's never an issue.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   Supplement plans, it may or may not be.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.880]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.240]   So I'll ask another one,
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   and then Miriam, after this one,
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.360]   I'll switch back to you for an RSVP
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.480]   or question from the chat.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.920]   So Lonnie, tell us about who's eligible for Medicare,
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.560]   who isn't, when you can sign up,
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.680]   and when is it effective?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.000]   - Okay, very good.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.480]   So for people that are, we call it aging into Medicare,
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.640]   your Medicare will begin the first day of the month
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.000]   that you turn 65.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.320]   And you can sign up or process that paperwork,
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.440]   if you will, up to 90 days in advance
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.400]   of your Medicare effective date.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.720]   Oh, by the way, if your birthday
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.360]   is on the first day of the month
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.080]   and your Medicare is actually effective
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.440]   the first of the month prior to your birthday.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:21.520]   Other people might get on Medicare due to a disability.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.280]   So people that are qualified
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.040]   for social security disability benefits
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.280]   typically are eligible for Medicare 25 months
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.720]   after their social security disability benefits begin.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.200]   And they are eligible to enroll in Medicare Part A
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.880]   and Part B, just like someone turning 65 would be as well.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.240]   Now, the question for a lot of people,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.720]   and we get asked this on a regular basis is,
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.840]   what if I'm still working or my spouse is still working,
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.800]   and we're getting health insurance benefits
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.200]   through mine or my spouse's employer?
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.800]   And for those people, you might want to delay enrollment
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.440]   in Medicare Part B.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.560]   You will automatically be enrolled into Medicare Part A
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.200]   based on when you turn 65.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.840]   But Medicare Part A for most people
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.360]   doesn't have a monthly premium.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.680]   So there's no downside for you to be enrolled in Part A.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.280]   If you have health insurance
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.240]   through yours or your spouse's employer,
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.000]   delaying enrollment in Medicare Part B
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.400]   simply means you won't be paying a premium for Part B
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.320]   until you actually enroll.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.720]   Now, a lot of people get concerned
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.640]   about a late enrollment penalty
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.360]   for delaying enrollment in Medicare Part B.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.880]   But as long as you're covered on a group health plan
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.920]   through you or your spouse,
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.960]   there will be no late enrollment penalty charge
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.000]   for deferring your enrollment in Medicare Part B.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.440]   - Okay, thanks.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.040]   Miriam?
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.920]   - Yes, Lonnie, it sounds like what is the best choice
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.520]   for an individual depends on where they live
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.480]   and what zip code they're in.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.760]   And we do have a question on moving states.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.880]   When you move states and you have your insurance
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.080]   and you need to choose a new Medicare Advantage
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.920]   or Medigap plan,
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.840]   can you do that?
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.200]   How do you do that?
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.160]   Is medical underwriting required?
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.920]   And then also, you haven't mentioned Medigap yet.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.040]   And this question also involves Medigap.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.360]   What is Medigap?
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.360]   And then, you know, moving states and medical underwriting.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.280]   - Okay, well, Miriam, I'll try to remember
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.480]   all the things that make up that question.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.600]   And if I forget any, just remind me at the end.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.560]   All right, so the first thing I'd like to address is,
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   is if I move from one state to another, what are my options?
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.720]   Well, if you're enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan,
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.480]   then when you move to a new location,
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.000]   you will get the opportunity,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.240]   no matter what time of the year,
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.600]   to enroll in a different Medicare Advantage plan
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.680]   in the state that you move to.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.920]   If you choose, you can also enroll
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.640]   in a Medicare Supplement plan,
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.120]   and you can do that without any medical underwriting.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.120]   Excuse me, meaning that you fill out the application
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.680]   and they must take you.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.480]   Now, if you're enrolled in a Medicare Supplement plan
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.840]   and you move to a different state,
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.360]   in most cases, the vast majority of cases,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.040]   you'll be able to keep the same Medicare Supplement plan
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.760]   you're enrolled in.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.000]   A prime example, we have a couple who recently moved
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.680]   from Texas to Idaho, and they communicated with me
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.600]   during the process of the move,
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   because they had exactly these kinds of questions.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.520]   They're enrolled in a Medicare Supplement plan,
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.240]   and they will remain enrolled
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.240]   in that particular Medicare Supplement plan.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.920]   Now, one thing that will happen is there will be
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.440]   an adjustment in the premium that they pay
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.160]   on that Medicare Supplement plan,
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.520]   because here in Texas, they were paying
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.120]   about $115, $118 a month each
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.960]   for their Medicare Supplement plan.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.160]   Going to Idaho, it looks like they're gonna be paying
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.000]   about $160 to $165 a month each
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.960]   for their Medicare Supplement plan.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.840]   The primary reason for that is the state of Idaho
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.440]   uses something called community rating,
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.520]   where a Medicare Supplement company,
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.240]   or let's say Plan G, which is the most popular out there,
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.360]   they have to charge everybody the same rate,
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.400]   regardless of whether they're 65 years of age
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.600]   or 95 years of age.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.000]   That's community rating.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.600]   And so for these people who are only 66, 67 years of age,
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.560]   it means an increased premium for them.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.080]   Medicare Supplement versus Medigap.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.720]   Most people in the industry refer
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.640]   to these Medicare plans that go along
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.920]   with the original Medicare as Medicare Supplement plans.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.560]   When you talk to anybody that's part
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.640]   of the federal government or the Center for Medicare
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.160]   and Medicaid Services,
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.880]   they refer to those same plans as Medigap.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.880]   So Medicare Supplement, Medigap,
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.000]   the same terms, just used interchangeably.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.080]   - So that pays for the 20% that Medicare does not pay for?
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.680]   - That's exactly correct.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.160]   - Okay.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.480]   And one other thing, we have another question.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.480]   It says, "If after initially enrolling in a Medigap plan,
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   "like N, can you eventually switch to another plan like G,
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.920]   "if you later find it more suitable?
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.360]   "And what about the underwriting?"
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.760]   - Good question.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.000]   So in the vast majority of states,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.800]   if you wanna move from any Medicare Supplement plan
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.000]   to any other Medicare Supplement plan,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.120]   even if it's the same letter designation,
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.720]   but with a different company,
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.520]   you're gonna have to submit an application
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.840]   and it will be subject to underwriting.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.600]   Now, something I just learned recently
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.720]   is I'm licensed in the state of Oklahoma.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.600]   We have 25 or 30 clients up there.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.560]   And one of your Boglehead members, as a matter of fact,
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.520]   called me to get help with her mother
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.120]   who lives in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.840]   And she informed me that Oklahoma just this year
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.280]   passed a law that provides for a Medicare Supplement,
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.280]   Medigap, open enrollment period every year on your birthday.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.800]   And it's a 60-day window that begins on your birthday.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.120]   So thank you for the Boglehead member
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.240]   who informed me of that.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.400]   I went and researched it, found that's absolutely the case.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.120]   So I think that's something that's done
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.400]   in about seven or eight states across the country now.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.800]   I think in general terms, that's probably an excellent idea.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.840]   And I would kind of like to see that adopted
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.560]   by more states across the country.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.680]   Does that answer your question, Harriet?
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.800]   - Yes, thank you.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.040]   Corey?
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.240]   - Thank you.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.280]   Next question.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.440]   My partner or I may plan to work after age 65
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.520]   and will be covered by an employer plan.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.960]   What do I have to do?
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.920]   What does COBRA affect?
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.080]   I'm sorry, how does COBRA affect this
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.280]   if my younger partner won't have insurance
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.960]   if I go on Medicare?
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.080]   - Great question.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.360]   Yeah, so if one of you is aging into Medicare
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.920]   and you're the employee
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.040]   who the health insurance is coming through,
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.920]   one of the things to know is under normal situations,
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.760]   you have the option to exercise COBRA for 18 months.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.280]   In a scenario like we've just described,
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.120]   that COBRA option is actually extended out to 36 months.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.440]   So that helps a lot of people with an age gap
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.880]   between the two spouses.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.360]   If that's not enough for you,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.400]   then the other option is the older spouse
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.800]   go ahead and get on Medicare
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.000]   and the other spouse get an individual health plan
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.640]   through the Affordable Care Act, et cetera,
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.720]   and something like that.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.240]   Was there another part to that question, Corey?
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   - I think, I'll read it again.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.080]   I think you covered it,
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.320]   but my partner or I may plan to work after age 65,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.760]   will be covered by an employer plan.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.880]   How does COBRA affect this
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.880]   if my younger partner won't have insurance
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.440]   if I go on Medicare?
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.000]   - Okay.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.280]   Yeah, and the other thing to remember
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.840]   is just simply that if one of the spouses
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.920]   is already getting social security retirement benefits,
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.320]   then they may automatically,
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.000]   Medicare may automatically enroll that spouse
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.240]   in Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.160]   And if you're in a scenario
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.720]   where you don't want Medicare Part B,
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.080]   as soon as you get that card,
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.720]   just give them a call and let them know
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.760]   that you do not want to be enrolled
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.640]   and they will correct that and send you a new card.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   - Okay.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.840]   Great to know.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.920]   Next question.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.920]   Let's say I'm a procrastinator.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.280]   I was even going to put off asking this question.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.880]   What happens if I don't sign up
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.440]   or don't do anything regarding Medicare?
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.280]   - All right.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:48.160]   So if you're no longer employed
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.520]   or your spouse is no longer employed,
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.280]   you don't have group health insurance
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.880]   and you fail to enroll in Medicare Part B
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.320]   at the time that you're eligible to do that,
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.120]   then your next opportunity to enroll
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.120]   is going to be during something called
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.080]   the general enrollment period.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.200]   And that happens from January 1
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.480]   through March 31 every year as well.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.240]   And the effective date of your enrollment
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.880]   will be the first day of the month
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.920]   after the date that you enroll.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:19.920]   Now, for every 12 months after you turn 65
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.960]   that you were eligible to be enrolled in Medicare
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.640]   and you did not enroll,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.960]   when you subsequently do enroll in Medicare Part B,
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.360]   there's going to be a 10% penalty.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.880]   So if you're 12 months to, I guess, 23 months
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.120]   past that enrollment date,
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.720]   it's a 10% penalty, 24 months, et cetera,
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.120]   it'll be a 20% penalty and on that road.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.160]   And that penalty stays with you for as long as you live.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.240]   So don't procrastinate.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   - Does it accrue interest?
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.560]   - It does not accrue interest.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.400]   - Okay.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.640]   - Wait, it's a penalty per month, per annual?
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.360]   - Well, it's...
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.800]   So right now the standard Medicare Part B premium
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.760]   is $174.70 a month.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.720]   So somebody who is facing a 10% penalty
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.440]   would pay that plus $17.74.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.120]   Does that answer your question, Miriam?
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.320]   - Forever.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.560]   - Forever, that's right.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.080]   - Okay.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:23.160]   - Okay, so the next set of questions
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.440]   are divided into Parts A, B, and D.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.880]   So we'll go through those three very separately
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.960]   so as to not overlap the content.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.640]   And then following those three categories of questions,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.080]   Miriam, we'll go back to you.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.640]   So the first one, tell us about Part A Medicare,
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.320]   imprints costs, restrictions, coverage,
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.000]   with some examples of what would be covered
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.040]   under Part B versus not covered.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.120]   Oh, this is...
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.960]   Okay, yeah.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.240]   - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.520]   Is that the question?
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.560]   - Yeah, I just wanted to make sure
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.240]   the covered under Part B versus not covered is intentional.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.960]   Did the question asker mean Part A?
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.400]   Tell us about Part A Medicare,
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.440]   costs, restrictions, coverage,
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.480]   with some examples of what would be covered under...
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.680]   Maybe it's Part A versus not covered.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.640]   - Okay, I think I understand the gist of the question.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.760]   So Medicare Part A is referred to as hospital insurance,
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.480]   and that's primarily what it is.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.600]   And it comes into play when you've been admitted
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.160]   into a hospital as an inpatient.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.520]   And I emphasize that because if you were in a hospital
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.040]   on an outpatient setting, day surgery, for instance,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.680]   that's all gonna be covered by Part B of Medicare,
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.400]   not Part A.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.240]   Part A also handles hospice,
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.760]   if you ever need that kind of service
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.080]   near end of life type thing.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.960]   And it also handles skilled nursing care.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.640]   So those are primarily the three things
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.880]   that Medicare Part A is responsible for covering.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.280]   Skilled nursing care typically comes into play
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.920]   if you've been admitted into a hospital as an inpatient.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.960]   And then you're, the way I describe it is
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.520]   you're not sick enough to stay in the hospital
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.160]   any longer, but you're not well enough
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.120]   or strong enough to go home and take care of yourself.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.640]   So some certain number of days might be ordered
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.240]   by your doctor for skilled nursing care
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:16.040]   so that you can continue to be monitored by medical staff.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.000]   That's Part A.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.880]   Medicare Part B called medical insurance
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.160]   is basically everything else medical related.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.280]   So that's your preventive care, treatments, diagnostics,
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.160]   lab work, x-rays, all those kinds of things.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.760]   - Okay.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.360]   So a follow-up question to the Part B part is,
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.560]   I've heard about Medicare Advantage programs
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.760]   and Medicare supplements.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.240]   You touched on Medigap earlier,
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.720]   but I'm not sure about Medicare Advantage.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.880]   How do those plans affect whether I need Part A
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.720]   and/or Part B?
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.200]   - Yeah, great question.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.600]   So before anybody can enroll
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.280]   in either a Medicare supplement/Medigap plan
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.240]   or a Medicare Advantage plan,
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:05.040]   you must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.120]   The way I describe it is Medicare Part A and Part B
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.200]   serve as the foundation of your health insurance
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.920]   from the time that you turn 65 in general
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.560]   to the time that you pass away.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.800]   And so for the vast majority of people,
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.440]   when you're either gonna get Medicare with a supplement plan
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.240]   or a Medicare Advantage plan.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.720]   So sometimes people come into the office
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.560]   and they're concerned
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.360]   about this Medicare Part A hospital deductible
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.320]   that's what's called a per benefit period deductible.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.280]   And in 2024, it's about $1,620.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.000]   But if you have a Medicare supplement plan,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.520]   you won't be responsible for that.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.160]   So you don't have to worry about it.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.600]   And if you have a Medicare Advantage plan,
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.280]   then the typical Medicare Part A,
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.240]   Medicare Part B deductibles and coinsurance
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.120]   don't apply to you either.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.000]   What you need to concern yourself with
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.640]   is what does my Medicare Advantage plan prescribe
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.120]   that I will have co-pays for, co-insurance for
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.640]   as I use the plan and use other medical services.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.080]   - Great, thank you.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.760]   So we'll move to the Part D part.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.200]   Tell us about Part D Medicare drug plans
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.600]   with some examples of what would be covered
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   under Part D versus not covered.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.240]   I currently take three different prescriptions
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.280]   and one is very expensive and no generic is available.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.440]   How can I find out
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.320]   what my lowest out-of-pocket cost would be?
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.640]   - Okay, great question.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.600]   So Medicare Part D, Medicare prescription drug plans,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.040]   these are plans that are authorized by
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.120]   and meet requirements that Medicare prescribes
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.280]   for prescription drug coverage.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.720]   And if you want to find which plan will provide
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.240]   the total lowest overall out-of-pocket cost for you,
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.160]   you can go to medicare.gov.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.920]   You can input your prescription information
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.520]   and it will show you every prescription drug plan
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.400]   that's available to you based on the county
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.120]   that you reside in.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.640]   And then it will default to sorting those plans
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.360]   with the sort being the lowest total out-of-pocket cost.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.720]   And by that, I mean, it will add up
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.320]   what the annual premium is for the plan
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.040]   and any co-pays that you're responsible for.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.120]   And oh, by the way, you can select the pharmacy
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.560]   or pharmacies that you might want to use in your local area
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.240]   and it will give you pricing for the prescriptions
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.200]   based on the drug plan selection and the pharmacy selection.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.080]   In addition to that, a lot of these plans
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.600]   might have mail-order coverage available.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.760]   And in a lot of cases, that can save you money.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.800]   In some cases, it doesn't save you any money,
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.600]   but that tool at medicare.gov can tell you that as well.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.480]   Now, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.360]   -I just put into the chat a calculator
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.320]   that you previously mentioned.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.640]   -Awesome. -Back to you.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:02.560]   -One other thing that I will add is we have had some folks,
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.680]   well, who take sometimes relatively expensive drugs
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   and can't find what they consider to be ample coverage
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.160]   in any Medicare prescription drug plan.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.920]   So a couple of resources that we share with our clients
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.440]   is goodrx.com.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.400]   It's just a discount program.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.440]   They have a free version and they have a paid version.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.560]   And they really can help sometimes with generic drugs
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.520]   that oftentimes would be considered tier-two drugs.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.280]   So you might have a co-pay on a prescription drug plan
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.480]   and you might enjoy a lower co-pay
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.120]   using a discount program like goodrx.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.720]   Another source, and this would be more
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.400]   for your more expensive brand-name drugs,
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.800]   is a website called costplusdrugs.com.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.480]   Those of us who live here in Texas
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.240]   are very familiar with Mark Cuban.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.720]   He's the billionaire that owns a majority stake
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.880]   in the Dallas Mavericks, and this is his company.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.600]   And he started it out of frustration with drug pricing
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.320]   and how the industry works, and it's his hope
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.040]   that he's gonna help bring some solution to that.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.800]   And then finally, we have some clients,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.520]   in fact, I've had clients share this with me,
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.360]   that use Canadian pharmacies.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.680]   And in certain cases, they found that those Canadian pharmacies
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.320]   can get them prescription drugs for less than the co-pay
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.200]   would be on a Medicare prescription drug plan.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.440]   So all things that you can check out,
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.600]   especially if you're taking more expensive drugs.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.360]   - Thank you, Lonnie, great resources to know about.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   Miriam?
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:46.240]   - Yes, along the Part D drug plans,
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.000]   we have a question about the coverage gap.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.440]   - Right. - And whether or not,
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.400]   could you explain what the coverage gap is?
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:00.360]   And the question actually has to do with when you have,
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.440]   what can be included in determining the coverage gap?
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.480]   - Okay, it's a great question,
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   and it's a bit of a complex answer, but I'll do my best.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.800]   So when Medicare prescription drug plans
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.040]   first came out in 2006, one side of the political aisle said,
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.040]   we want all the coverage to be on the front end
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.760]   or the most comprehensive coverage.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.400]   And the other side of the political aisle said,
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.280]   well, we want the most comprehensive part of the coverage
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.720]   to be on the back end.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.160]   So it was literally designed by committee.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.120]   And we got this thing where you had co-pays
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.720]   for most prescriptions up front,
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.880]   then you had this coverage gap in the middle,
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.840]   and then you had some more comprehensive coverage
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.680]   on the back end.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:45.000]   When prescription plans for drug plans first came out,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.880]   when you entered the coverage gap,
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.320]   you were paying 100% of the cost of the drug yourself.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.000]   That has since been modified so that today,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.320]   when you enter the coverage gap,
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.280]   you're paying 25% of the cost of the drug yourself.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.640]   The 75% is provided by discount from the drug manufacturer
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.480]   and some coverage from your prescription drug plan.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.440]   Now, what gets you into the coverage gap
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.520]   is how much you're spending on prescription drugs.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.680]   The number changes a little bit each year
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.400]   to adjust for inflation, but I think in 2024,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.400]   when you spent approximately $2,300, $2,400 on prescriptions
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.120]   and that includes the full cost of the drug,
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.840]   so that's what you paid in co-pays
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.120]   plus what the insurance company is paying,
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:33.120]   when that number in a calendar year reaches say 2,400 bucks,
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.440]   then you go from what they call the initial coverage level
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.600]   into the coverage gap.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.440]   And at that point,
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.200]   you're paying 25% of the cost of the drug.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.800]   Then to get moved from the coverage gap
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.920]   to an area they call catastrophic coverage
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.440]   is another even more complex calculation
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.920]   that includes a whole lot of things,
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.520]   but suffice it to say,
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.640]   any prescription drug plan that you're involved with
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.200]   will keep you informed as to how much you have to go
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.440]   before you get out of the coverage gap
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.120]   into catastrophic coverage.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.880]   Once you move to catastrophic coverage,
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.560]   worst case scenario, you'll pay 5% of the retail costs
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.040]   and in many cases, you'll pay zero
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.600]   based on some calculations.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.560]   - Okay, the question here is,
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.320]   if you fill a prescription that is not covered
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.800]   by your particular Part D plan,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.120]   after making all the calculations
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.600]   that you have the right plan,
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.680]   is there any way for those costs to be included
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:37.240]   in your total costs for being out of the coverage gap?
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:43.280]   - All right, so give you a typical scenario
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.480]   where this might apply.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:49.280]   Client comes in, they tell me what prescriptions they take
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.600]   and we advise them to enroll in a particular plan
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.320]   based on those prescriptions and the plan
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.680]   that'll provide the best coverage in our estimation
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.520]   using the medicare.gov tool.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.720]   February, March, April, sometime during the next year,
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.640]   they get prescribed a new drug
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.800]   and that drug is not on the formulary
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.440]   for their particular prescription plan.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.040]   And that typically creates anxiety.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.560]   So one of the things that can oftentimes be done
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.720]   is if you will have your doctor or doctor's office
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.800]   write a letter to the prescription drug plan
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.960]   and ask for a formulary exception,
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.560]   then in most cases, those things get granted.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.040]   Now, the exception might be
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.440]   that you're gonna have it covered at a tier three level,
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.960]   which means you're still gonna have substantial co-pay,
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.920]   but at least you have coverage for the drug.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.600]   And I'm sorry, Miriam, was there a second part of that?
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.360]   - I think you answered the question.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.000]   - Okay, very good.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.400]   Lori, before we move on,
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.520]   I'm gonna ask two more questions
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.720]   based basically on this particular subject,
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.800]   but there is another question in the chat
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.080]   that we should approach later, okay?
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:00.920]   - Sure.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.160]   - Okay, Lonnie, what about,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.760]   we have a question on a disabled veteran.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.520]   I like the idea of original Medicare,
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.160]   but for a disabled veteran who has healthcare
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.920]   through the VA, including dental, vision, and prescriptions,
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.200]   is it just money out the door
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   or is the lower or no cost of an Advantage plan enough?
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   - Okay, that's a difficult question to answer
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.520]   because it's gonna depend upon your particular situation.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:40.520]   We have a number of clients who are former military people,
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.120]   some who have VA benefits,
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:46.720]   some who have TRICARE benefits.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.480]   And I'm not an expert in the benefits
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.760]   that military folks get,
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.640]   but I do know that if you have TRICARE,
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.400]   it typically means that you were a career military,
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.680]   retired from the military,
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.640]   and you and your spouse enjoy this TRICARE benefit.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.560]   So if you have the TRICARE benefit,
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.080]   then you probably don't need to worry about anything else
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.640]   because it will cover all of your medical costs
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.040]   with very minimal out-of-pocket costs to you.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.240]   If, on the other hand, you have VA benefits,
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.760]   that can be a very different story.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:23.480]   And a lot of the answer as to whether you need to worry
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.000]   about getting an Advantage plan will depend upon,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.880]   do you have access to that VA care near where you live?
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.640]   Is the VA care near you satisfactory to you?
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.080]   We have some clients here who love the VA system
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.400]   here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.600]   and wouldn't go anywhere else.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.400]   And we have others that tell you,
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.120]   "I wouldn't go there, they'll kill you."
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.360]   So for some of those folks,
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.000]   we help them enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.560]   so that they can go outside the VA system should they choose,
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.280]   go to a doctor that's in the network
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.400]   for that particular plan
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.400]   and still have pretty comprehensive coverage.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.480]   And then they can choose to go inside the VA system
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.880]   when it suits them.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.120]   -Okay, thank you.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.000]   And then my last question is from the chat.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.480]   If I have a Kaiser as a supplement plan,
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.120]   if I have Kaiser as a supplement plan
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:22.040]   and I move to an area where there is no Kaiser,
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.800]   what should I do?
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.320]   -Okay, so my understanding of Kaiser
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.120]   is it wouldn't be a supplement plan,
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.560]   it would be a Medicare Advantage plan.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.240]   And if that's the case,
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.080]   if you move outside the service area for Kaiser,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.600]   you're going to have to select a different Medicare plan,
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.960]   whether that's Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.440]   But with those kinds of plans,
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.760]   you have to live in their service area.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.800]   -Thank you.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.320]   Cory? -Miriam, you mentioned
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.920]   you had another one from the chat.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.560]   Do you want to cover that now to make sure we get to it?
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.720]   -Sure. Ed asked a question.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.720]   It is a long question, but he wanted, Lonnie,
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.840]   if he could speak to this.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:15.840]   And apparently, Ed said that he negotiated in his job
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.240]   hundreds of managed-care contracts
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.800]   through 30 years in healthcare administration
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.760]   for the 17 cancer centers I managed.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.440]   I escorted several Medicare Advantage insurers
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.800]   like Humana and WellCare, now Centene,
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:40.280]   out of my cancer centers for wanting to take reimbursements
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:45.800]   at less than Medicare traditional payment rates.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.200]   If you can afford a supplement,
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.720]   I highly recommend enrolling and keeping it
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.920]   as long as you can afford it to keep great providers.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.520]   And the first part of the question was,
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.800]   be aware that Medicare Advantage plans
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.920]   negotiate with providers for a reduced reimbursement rate.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.880]   This is how they can offer perks such as gym memberships,
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.640]   Visa cards for groceries, dental, pet cares, et cetera,
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.400]   and this greatly reduces your provider network
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.160]   and quality of providers.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.880]   And what's the question?
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.000]   -Can you speak to this?
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.280]   And I think the question actually is
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.520]   that if you can afford a supplement,
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.160]   he recommends enrolling and keeping it
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.720]   as long as you can afford it to keep your great providers.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.160]   -Okay.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.280]   So this is a discussion that comes up
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.560]   from at least 10 or 15 people
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.400]   every enrollment period in our office around the fall.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:04.240]   So going back to, I think, a discussion we had previously,
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.760]   if having access to all the possible providers
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.960]   you could have access to is important to you,
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.280]   then there's no question that having original Medicare
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.920]   and a supplement plan is probably the right answer
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.480]   for you.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.520]   And I would further tell you that if Medicare Advantage
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.080]   is something that you're interested in,
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.080]   the kind of Medicare Advantage plan you're going to find
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.360]   will be largely dictated by where you live.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.200]   For instance, we're just outside the Dallas-Fort Worth area,
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.080]   large metropolitan area.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.560]   There are a number of what I would consider
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.680]   to be very comprehensive Medicare Advantage plans
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.760]   who have very broad networks of hospitals,
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.440]   medical providers of all kinds, et cetera.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.760]   But if you get into a more rural area,
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.680]   you're going to find that that's not necessarily the case.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.360]   You'll find there's less competition.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.360]   You'll find that there are smaller networks,
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.800]   and you will definitely find that your annual
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.560]   out-of-pocket maximums along with your co-pays
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.400]   for medical care are going to be higher
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.920]   than they will be in a more populated area.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.200]   So I would say that it depends on,
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.760]   one, what's important to you,
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.680]   and, two, what options do you have in Medicare Advantage plans?
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.800]   And then maybe another consideration --
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.680]   well, definitely another consideration is,
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.760]   what's the premium you're going to pay for a supplement plan?
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.360]   Because that's always got to be a part of the equation.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.680]   -Okay.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.040]   Thank you.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.200]   Next question, does Part A or Part B cover dental or eye care?
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.920]   How do I get dental or eye care?
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.080]   -All right, great question.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:51.360]   Medicare Part A and Part B don't cover vision or dental
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.280]   or any other what Medicare Advantage plans
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.200]   call "extra benefits."
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.280]   Now, I'm going to say something
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.520]   that may be a little bit controversial.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.800]   There are individual dental and vision plans
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.400]   available for purchase,
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:13.880]   but in my humble opinion, I'm not a big fan.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.880]   At least here in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.600]   where we have a number of clients,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.520]   I've researched a number of dental plans,
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:25.560]   and I just not found any that, in my estimation,
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.240]   deliver enough value to warrant paying a premium for those plans.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.840]   So when people come to us and ask about dental coverage,
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.000]   I typically say, "Just go to your dentist,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.080]   see if maybe they offer some kind of a discount program
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.680]   that you can purchase or a real insurance program
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.720]   you can purchase, but what I have to offer you
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.080]   is not going to provide great value."
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.240]   Dental, vision, over-the-counter benefits,
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.760]   those are the kinds of things that are offered
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.680]   along with Medicare Advantage plans,
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.440]   not Medicare Supplement plans, or Medicare Part A and Part B.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.480]   -Okay, thanks.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.040]   I'm going to slip in a question
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.480]   that relates to what Miriam asked earlier from the chat.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.000]   You'll forgive me if it's insensitive,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.800]   and you'll navigate, you know, the kind of political
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.400]   or controversial aspect of it,
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.480]   but I think it may resonate with a lot of the crowd,
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.760]   so I'm going to ask it.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.960]   What's Medicare's general reputation
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.600]   for fairly and timely compensating physicians
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.280]   who accept Medicare?
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:29.400]   -In general, I don't know.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.600]   I don't ever see that side of things.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.080]   I don't hear complaints from the medical providers that I know,
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.560]   which is only a handful of people, about Medicare.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.520]   Well, the complaint I hear is about the reimbursement rate.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.840]   They're not crazy about that,
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.440]   but I don't hear them complain
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.600]   about the time it takes for Medicare to reimburse them.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.320]   -Okay, good to know.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.920]   Next question.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.840]   Tell us about Part C Medicare plans
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.040]   with some examples of what would be covered
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.640]   under Part C versus not covered.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.160]   -This area is confusing to me
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.440]   since I see a lot of commercials and ads
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.960]   saying they include things like dental, eye care,
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.400]   gym membership, over-the-counter drugs, et cetera.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.720]   I really like my doctor and university teaching hospital
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.800]   that I used during employer health insurance.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.720]   Can I continue to go to that doctor?
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:25.280]   What if I must go to an out-of-network hospital
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.080]   or doctor?
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.640]   -Okay.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.080]   All good questions.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.040]   So, first of all, Medicare Part C,
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.480]   a.k.a. Medicare Advantage plans,
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.960]   when you enroll in one of those plans,
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.760]   what it means is you're getting your Medicare Part A
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.840]   and Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D,
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:49.160]   prescription drug benefits, all from one plan.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.400]   It's all combined together, much like health insurance
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.400]   you might get from an employer.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.800]   Now, the question of whether you can continue
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.240]   to use your teaching hospital,
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.360]   you just need to check with the plan
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.360]   and see whether the hospital is in network for that plan
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.400]   and whether their associated clinics are
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.320]   and doctors that have admitting rights
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.000]   in the hospital are, et cetera.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.360]   And as far as the extra benefits --
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.960]   Excuse me for a second.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:23.760]   Most Medicare Advantage plans include those extra benefits,
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:28.400]   like vision, dental, a fitness benefit,
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.400]   oftentimes referred to as silver sneakers,
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.160]   an over-the-counter benefit,
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.600]   and a lot of them provide benefits
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.400]   for hearing aids, et cetera.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.560]   And the way they can provide those benefits
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.400]   is for every county across the country,
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.360]   Medicare tells Medicare Advantage plans,
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.640]   "We're going to reimburse you X dollars per month
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.000]   for every member that you have enrolled."
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.080]   And so the health insurance company takes that number
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.280]   and determines that.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.920]   We can design a plan with these Medicare Part A,
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.320]   Part B, and drug benefits
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.400]   in addition to these extra benefits
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.600]   for the money that Medicare is allowing for us
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.200]   for each member involved.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.480]   And so they just try to get that as competitive as they can
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.160]   so they can get more membership
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.880]   versus other health insurance companies.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.280]   -Okay. Next question's about Medigap.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.680]   You may have covered it already.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.680]   I'll ask it quickly to see if there's anything
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.120]   you want to add to it
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.880]   and then just to tee up what to expect
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.720]   for the rest of the hour as we're 7 minutes to 9.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.960]   Miriam, I'll ask three quick questions
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.640]   that relate to Medicare Advantage
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.200]   and then switch it back to you
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.720]   if there's time for RSVP or chat.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.520]   So this one that you may have covered already,
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.840]   "Tell us about Medigap supplemental plans.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.240]   What are the gaps that I would have to pay for
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.520]   depending on what plan I choose?"
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.520]   And if you've answered it fully already, we can move on.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.840]   -No, we'll get into that a little bit.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.120]   So in most states, Medigap plans are standardized,
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.480]   and that means that they have a letter designation,
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   A through N, and that letter designation
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.520]   tells you exactly what coverage you get.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.440]   So whether you buy a plan from Humana, UnitedHealthcare,
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.920]   or any other health insurance company out there,
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.840]   the most popular plan sold today
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.440]   is Medicare Supplement Plan G or Medigap Plan G.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.040]   With Medigap Plan G,
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.480]   the only out-of-pocket exposure you have
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:24.040]   is to satisfy the Medicare Part B annual deductible.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.840]   And in 2024, that deductible amount will be $240.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.840]   So once you've done that,
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.920]   no further out-of-pocket expenses with the Plan G.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.840]   Now, another very popular plan
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.600]   is Medicare Supplement Plan N.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.240]   And with the Plan N,
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.960]   your only out-of-pocket exposure, again,
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.760]   is that Medicare Part B annual deductible.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:48.240]   And then there's a $20 copay for every doctor office visit
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:52.080]   and a $50 copay should you use a hospital emergency room.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.440]   Now, one other thing to note is,
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.680]   with Medicare Supplement Plan N,
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.280]   it states that you're also subject
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.480]   to paying the Medicare Part B excess charges.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.280]   We haven't talked about that yet, so let me address that.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.560]   In the medical world, if a medical provider says,
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.360]   "I accept Medicare assignment,"
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.680]   that means that they're accepting the Medicare fee schedule.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.400]   But a medical provider can choose to treat Medicare patients
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.520]   and not accept the Medicare fee schedule.
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.240]   And in that scenario, that provider can charge
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.080]   as much as 15% more than the Medicare fee schedule.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.800]   And that's called the Medicare Part B excess charges.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.600]   So if you have a supplement plan like Plan G
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.840]   and you go to a provider
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.760]   who charges those Medicare Part B excess charges,
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.040]   you're not responsible for paying those.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.120]   But if you choose a Plan N,
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.680]   because it's got a lower premium
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.760]   and you use a provider who charges those excess charges,
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.800]   then you're subject to paying
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.080]   that extra 15% out of your pocket.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.440]   Now, this, I think years ago,
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.160]   was a bigger issue than it is today.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.600]   The last numbers I saw from Medicare,
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.160]   and I researched this about a year and a half ago,
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.600]   is that some 94, 95% of medical providers out there
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.360]   who treat Medicare patients
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.760]   do not charge Medicare Part B excess charges.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:16.480]   So this would only come into play for very few people.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.120]   - Okay.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:23.400]   Next question relates to Medicare Advantage.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.240]   What would happen if I picked neither a supplement
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.760]   nor a Medicare Advantage plan,
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.960]   and I contracted a disease or chronic illness
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.840]   that requires 20 days of hospital care,
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.400]   and then an ongoing outpatient treatment weekly
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.840]   with a list price of $5,000 per week for a year?
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.360]   What could that cost me?
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.440]   - Okay.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.480]   So with Medicare Part A,
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:49.920]   if you're admitted into a hospital,
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:53.600]   you first have a Medicare Part A hospital deductible,
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.840]   and it's a per-benefit period deductible.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:01.840]   And in 2024, that number's approximately $1,620.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:06.040]   So your hospital bill for up to 60 days in the hospital
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.560]   is $1,620.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:10.120]   And per-benefit period means
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.320]   that once you're admitted to the hospital,
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.360]   or I should say, once you're discharged from the hospital,
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.640]   that will count 60 calendar days.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.560]   If you're readmitted into the hospital in that window,
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.440]   then you're considered to be in the same benefit period,
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.080]   and you would not be subject to paying
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.680]   the Part A hospital deductible again.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.840]   But if you're discharged from a hospital
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.640]   and more than 60 days has passed
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.600]   and you're readmitted to the hospital,
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.600]   then you're subject to paying
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.640]   that hospital deductible again.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.440]   Now, again, that covers you
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.240]   for up to 60 days in the hospital.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.960]   If you're there beyond 60 days,
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.560]   then you have a daily copay
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.000]   beyond that Part A hospital deductible.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.840]   And that information's somewhere in the document
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:54.080]   that I have provided, but I don't see it right now.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.880]   Now, for Medicare Part B,
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.360]   so this is your medical coverage,
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.920]   so everything outside the hospital.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:03.560]   And by the way, even if you're an inpatient in the hospital
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.000]   and you're there for surgery, as an example,
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.520]   the hospital bill is covered by Part A
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.760]   for what we just talked about.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:15.240]   But if your surgeon is still gonna be covered by Part B,
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.880]   along with the anesthesiologist
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.120]   and other medical professionals
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.080]   that are involved in your care.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.160]   So for Part B, you have an annual deductible.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.800]   In 2024, that's $240.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.720]   Once you satisfy that deductible,
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.800]   then you're subject to 20% coinsurance.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.640]   And the risk for people is that 20% coinsurance
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.360]   doesn't have a cap on it.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:39.040]   So God forbid, if you had a half million dollar Part B bill
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:39.920]   in the course of a year,
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.720]   then your 20% comes to $100,000.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.640]   Does that answer your question?
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.360]   - I believe so.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.320]   It reminds me of one of the,
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.440]   it was someone from the Fed or a treasury secretary said,
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.520]   "If that made sense to you, you've misunderstood me."
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.840]   (laughing)
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.920]   So two more, and then I realize we'll go past nine,
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.360]   but Lonnie was kind enough to say
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.120]   we can have him for longer.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.440]   So I do wanna flip to Miriam,
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.680]   but I also wanna close out
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.600]   these few Medicare Advantage questions.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.160]   So the next one is,
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.520]   I've heard stories about Medicare Advantage
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.800]   having pre-approvals, delaying approvals,
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.360]   arguing with doctors on treatment plans.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.320]   I went through that with my bad employer insurance,
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:27.240]   and I don't wanna argue about issues like this.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.000]   What do you recommend?
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.040]   - Okay.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   So I will tell you that with Medicare Part A, Part B,
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.520]   and a Medicare Supplement Plan,
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.920]   I have never heard of those kinds of things happening.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.160]   Compare that to Medicare Advantage,
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.680]   and I will say that, again,
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:50.320]   I started doing this in 2007.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:54.840]   And for all those years up until about 2021, 2022,
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:58.720]   we have had a number of people
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:01.200]   enroll in Medicare Advantage plans.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.320]   And we might've had one that I know of
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.320]   that was faced with a situation
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:11.120]   where they were trying to get preauthorized
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.200]   for some kind of medical test or procedure,
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.760]   and the insurance company said no.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:20.200]   Well, in 2023, I had three clients face that scenario.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:24.400]   So this is becoming a little more prevalent.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.120]   However, in all three of those situations
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.280]   that I'm aware of, understand that
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.200]   with every Medicare Advantage plan,
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.960]   you have an appeals process.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.720]   And with every Medicare Advantage plan,
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:40.040]   you have something called a FAST appeal.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.760]   And FAST appeal means they must provide you an answer
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:44.360]   within 48 hours.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:48.880]   So let me take the liberty of a story.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.080]   - And I'm sorry, is it 48 calendar hours?
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.600]   So if it's asked on a Friday,
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.640]   is it next business day, like Monday, or?
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.200]   - No, it's 48 hours.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:02.080]   - So let's say someone asks late Friday night
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.200]   and the answer is due Sunday night?
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.040]   - Yep.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.120]   - Okay. - Correct.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:10.600]   I had a couple come in the annual enrollment period
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.920]   near the end of 2022.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.920]   And they had both been on Medicare for three or four years,
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.960]   and they had only Medicare Part A and Part B
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.400]   and never worried about anything else.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.960]   And that worked okay for them,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.200]   but they were both a little concerned
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.120]   about what their financial exposure might be
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.120]   if they developed a medical condition.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.320]   So they both enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.680]   She's had no problems at all, so she's great.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.840]   About March, April this year,
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.800]   I get a call from the husband and he says,
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.840]   "Hey, I've developed a back problem.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.800]   "My doctor says I need an MRI
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.480]   "and potential preparation for a surgical procedure."
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.560]   And the health insurance company said,
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.480]   "No, you need to go do some physical therapy
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.120]   "or something else first before we go that route."
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.560]   And he said, "I'm in a lot of pain.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.840]   "My doctor says that's a waste of time.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.240]   "What can I do?"
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.000]   And I said, "You can file an appeal."
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.440]   And he says, "Well, how do I do that?"
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.280]   I said, "I'm gonna find the phone number for you
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.360]   "and I'll call you right back."
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.880]   So I found the number, gave it to him,
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.680]   and he texted me the very next day,
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.840]   I think by 11 o'clock, 11.30 in the morning,
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.040]   and said, "Thanks for the help.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.240]   "I just received a text from the insurance company.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.080]   "It's been approved.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.160]   "We're going forward with the MRI in a couple of days."
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.880]   In every other scenario, the two others that I'm aware of,
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.160]   probably took just a little bit longer than that.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.720]   But here's what I would say.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.120]   Is it possible for those kinds of things to happen?
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:32.960]   Absolutely.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:37.440]   But with every insurance company, Medicare dictates
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.480]   there must be an appeals process.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.240]   And the first level of appeal is with the insurance company.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.360]   The second level of appeal
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.720]   is even with the insurance company.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.120]   But if it goes to a third level of appeal,
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.400]   then it's with a committee outside the insurance company.
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:55.480]   And I mean, in all the years I've done this,
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.480]   including those three,
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.720]   I think I've had maybe three others
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.640]   that had to file an appeal for something like that.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:06.480]   And in every scenario at the first level of appeal,
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.560]   it was all approved and they got their stuff done
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.400]   as they wanted or needed to get done.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.920]   - Okay, great.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:17.080]   So last Medicare Advantage question for now.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:20.040]   My doctor says I need to have my husband removed.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.120]   Does Medicare Advantage cover that?
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.040]   I made that up.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:25.880]   Okay.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.400]   Who best fits a Medigap supplement plan?
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.400]   Who best fits a Medicare Advantage?
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:36.600]   - Oh, wow.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.640]   Well, I guess first of all,
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.360]   if we may have covered this before,
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.680]   if it's absolutely imperative to you
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.600]   that you be able to see any doctor or any medical provider
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:49.200]   you wanna see anywhere in the country,
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.440]   then Medicare with a supplement plan is the obvious choice.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:57.160]   Or if you're concerned about,
[00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.160]   well, I have treatments going on
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.160]   and if I had a Medicare Advantage plan,
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.760]   I might reach the annual out-of-pocket maximum,
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.680]   which might be three or $4,000 or more.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:11.200]   And I don't wanna face that potential out-of-pocket maximum.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.480]   Then in your scenario,
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.320]   then you'd probably be better off
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.920]   with a Medicare supplement plan as well.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.040]   Conversely, we have people that walk in and say,
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.040]   hey, I've been on a Medicare supplement plan
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.640]   for fill in the blank, two years, 10 years, 20 years.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.200]   I go to the doctor once a year.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.120]   I go to the doctor once every 10 years,
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.520]   whether I need to or not.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.840]   I'm paying all this premium.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.400]   I don't see the value in it.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.400]   Tell me about these Medicare Advantage plans.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.400]   So a lot of the decision is driven by us trying to forecast
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.440]   how are you, where are you gonna be less out-of-pocket
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.960]   money-wise, okay?
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.400]   And if we find that that's gonna be
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.040]   with Medicare Advantage, we recommend that.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.720]   If we find it's gonna be with Medicare supplement,
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.680]   we recommend that.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.600]   And of course, we have a number of customers
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.480]   who come in and say, I want a supplement.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.040]   Okay, we'll help you with a supplement.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.680]   And conversely, some come in and say,
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.280]   I want a Medicare Advantage.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.720]   So it's just all about finding
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.240]   what the right fit is for the person.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.240]   - Okay, turn it over to Miriam for RSVP or chat questions.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.280]   - Yes, Lonnie, you scared me.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.240]   You scared me and I would suggest
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.920]   that if the procrastinator is here tonight,
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:27.920]   that they start to think about these medical decisions
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.560]   which plans, this is very difficult, complicated.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.600]   And Lonnie, one question is,
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.000]   in the Medicare book you're talking about,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.840]   and it is referenced here,
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.480]   are these answers to these questions also in that book?
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.360]   - Yeah, I would say if you read that book
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.680]   or if you have a question and go to that book,
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.120]   you can probably find answers
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.160]   to 95% of your questions about Medicare.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.880]   It really is a comprehensive guide
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.040]   to the way the program works.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.480]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.200]   We have many questions.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.360]   It's hard to, let me see.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.360]   There is one related to, there's one on the HSA.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.720]   Perhaps we could, let me ask that question
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.200]   since Rich has been waiting.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.040]   I have some money in an HSA,
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.440]   which is a health savings account.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.440]   Can I use this money to pay for Medicare Part B premiums
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.080]   and for the Supplement Plan G premiums?
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.280]   - Great question, and I'm glad I have the answer here
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.360]   on the document that I provided and it's in front of me.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.160]   So first, you probably know this, but I'll mention it.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.080]   You must stop making contributions
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.400]   into your health savings account
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.160]   because you're no longer gonna be enrolled
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.560]   in what's called a high-deductible health plan.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.720]   You can use the funds out of your HSA account
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:56.960]   to pay for Medicare Part B, Part C,
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.360]   which is Medicare Advantage,
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.640]   if you're enrolled in that, or Part D premiums.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.880]   You cannot use the HSA funds to pay for the Supplement Plan
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.040]   or the HSA funds to pay for Medicare Supplement
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.760]   or Medigap Plan premiums.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.160]   I'm not sure why they wrote the law that way, but they did.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.640]   And then of course, you can also use the funds to pay
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.640]   for any and all medical expenses that you might have,
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.120]   anything that the IRS deems medical expenses,
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.360]   just like you did before getting on Medicare.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.520]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.200]   The next question is following up on the Part D question,
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.240]   we're discussing buying your drugs
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.880]   through Wood Rx or Cost Plus,
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.400]   which could be a significant savings.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.880]   Is there a way to add those costs to the calculation
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.240]   to move out of the coverage gap?
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.880]   - That's the last part again?
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.880]   - Can you use, is there a way to add those costs?
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.160]   I think what is meant is what you've paid
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:09.160]   to the Good Rx or the Cost Plus to the calculation
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.800]   to move out of the coverage gap.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.640]   - Oh, sorry.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.240]   No, there is no way to do that.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.280]   If you're using one of the programs
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.760]   that we just talked about, then it's a drug,
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.760]   you're not using your Prescription Drug Plan
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.640]   to pay for those drugs
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.720]   and they will not be a part of that calculation.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.680]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.320]   Let me see.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.400]   Let me do one more question here.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.960]   "You may have covered this, but I want to confirm.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:42.160]   "If I turn 65 and I'm still working,
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.240]   "I only need to sign up for Part A
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.800]   "and use my employer health benefits.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.400]   "I only sign up," in other words, is it so,
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.680]   "that I only sign up for Part B and D
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:01.680]   "and get Medicare Advantage after I leave my employer?"
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.640]   - Yeah, so I'm glad you asked the question
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.640]   because what I didn't say is you have the option.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.600]   So you're going to be automatically enrolled
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.080]   in Medicare Part A.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.440]   You can defer enrollment without penalty
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.280]   in Medicare Part B and keep your employer's health plan.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.720]   But you might work for an employer
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.480]   who charges a relatively high premium
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.800]   that's coming out of your paycheck
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.520]   to pay for that health plan.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.920]   Financially speaking, it might be to your benefit
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.320]   to go ahead and enroll in Medicare Part B
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.040]   and then get either a supplement plan
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.720]   or Medicare Advantage plan.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.720]   So you do what's in your best interest.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.920]   The option is entirely up to you.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.120]   And let me add one other thing to that discussion as well.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.800]   I found this out the hard way.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.880]   As long as you're on your employer's insurance
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.320]   and you delay enrollment in Medicare Part B,
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.480]   there will be no late enrollment penalty.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.720]   However, I had a client come to me
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   and he was offered a buyout package from his employer.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.240]   And a part of the buyout package was
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.640]   that the employer paid for his and his spouse's
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.200]   health insurance for a period of a year.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.720]   Well, right near the time that he was offered
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.800]   this buyout package, he turned 65,
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.440]   but didn't worry about enrolling in Medicare Part B
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.120]   because he had this health insurance from his employer.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.600]   When he got ready to enroll in Medicare Part B,
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:32.000]   then Medicare charged him a 10% late enrollment penalty.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.240]   Even though it was group health insurance,
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.200]   it was considered COBRA health insurance,
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.200]   not employer health insurance.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.760]   And because he wasn't gainfully employed by the employer
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.960]   or his spouse wasn't employed by the employer
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.120]   providing the health insurance,
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.760]   it doesn't qualify for deferring
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:53.160]   that Medicare Part B late enrollment.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.440]   So just be very careful of that.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.040]   - They were not considered employed
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.480]   because it was a buyout package
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.680]   and they were no longer actually working.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.120]   - That's correct.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.440]   - Okay.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:08.000]   I believe when I was working and I turned 65,
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.960]   I signed up for Part A, I did not sign up for Part B,
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.320]   but I did have to do something with Medicare.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.440]   I had to like fill out a form or let them know
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:21.960]   that I was still working and I was on employer insurance.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.560]   Therefore, hold off on the Part B,
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.720]   I'm putting it on the back burner.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.160]   - Right.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.960]   Yeah, you may indeed have to communicate that with them.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.480]   - With Medicare?
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.520]   - Yes, correct.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.840]   - Yes.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.320]   And I believe that I have a friend that I worked with,
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.800]   who I worked with, who did not.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.640]   And he then got into trouble with Medicare with that.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.720]   He did not tell them.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.560]   - Interesting.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:56.400]   - Okay, Laurie, why not open for a raise hand?
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.360]   - Sure, yeah, we'll turn, yeah, great.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.440]   Let's turn it over to the audience for live questions.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.720]   Again, feel free to continue submitting questions
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.360]   to the chat, but if you'd like to ask a question
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.720]   to Lonnie verbally directly,
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.520]   please raise your hand with the hand raise function on Zoom.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.440]   And absent that, I have some great questions
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.400]   to continue with that I'm sure will resonate
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.240]   with the audience.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:26.520]   So absent audience questions, I'll proceed.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.280]   Next question, I have a large 401(k)
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.360]   and other pre-tax savings accounts,
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:36.200]   and I expect a very large, around $200,000 RMD,
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.160]   required minimum distribution.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.840]   As we say, a good problem to have.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.080]   How does this affect my life?
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.480]   What is the most IRMA premium I could pay?
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.520]   - Great question.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:54.920]   So for 2024, the highest Medicare Part B IRMA premium
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.040]   is $594 per month.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.680]   If you're married, that would apply
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.720]   to both you and your spouse.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.600]   And if you're subject to Medicare Part B IRMA,
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.560]   then you're also subject to Medicare Part D,
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.160]   as in dog IRMA.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.360]   So if you have a standalone prescription drug plan,
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.640]   or if you're enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.680]   that includes prescription drug coverage,
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.560]   then you would be subject to that.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:25.560]   And the highest Part D IRMA premium is $81 per month.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.680]   So that means if you're enrolled
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.200]   in a Medicare prescription drug plan that has a premium,
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.600]   you're gonna pay the plan premium
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.240]   plus the $81 per month Part D IRMA.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.440]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.680]   Another great question.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.000]   I plan on traveling to all the states in the U.S.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.480]   during my retirement in an RV
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.640]   or spending significant time outside of the U.S.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.600]   What considerations should I make?
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.600]   - Okay, so as far as Medicare coverage is concerned,
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.160]   it's in the U.S. only, not outside the U.S.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.520]   So let me address that first.
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.240]   We have a number of countries in the U.S.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.760]   who do travel internationally
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.640]   and you can purchase international health insurance coverage
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.280]   for, I'll say, very cheaply.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.680]   If you're gonna be gone for two weeks, a month,
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.120]   you can get probably a million dollars worth
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.600]   of health coverage for you and a spouse
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.600]   for probably, I don't know, $120, $150
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.960]   for a two-week trip, let's say.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:33.080]   And that's good for just most countries in the world.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.320]   - And more specifically, does that mean
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.080]   you pay fully out-of-pocket
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.120]   and then expect a good percentage reimbursement?
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:44.080]   - Well, it depends on the company that you're dealing with,
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.600]   but in most cases, no.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.200]   It will act pretty much like health insurance
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.280]   here in the United States
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:52.400]   where it might be 80/20 co-insurance
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.440]   and they'll charge you the 20%
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.440]   and then the insurance company handles the 80% of the cost.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.480]   The insurance company handles the 80% on the back end.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.760]   - So that means the medical provider abroad
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.320]   would accept that insurance if that's, okay.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.240]   - Correct.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:13.000]   Now, Medicare supplement plans
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.480]   do have limited international coverage.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.240]   I think it's 25,000 or 50,000.
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.320]   I don't remember the number now.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.080]   And many Medicare Advantage plans
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.800]   also have a similar level of international health coverage.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.720]   And typically, that's 80/20 co-insurance as well,
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.280]   up to the maximum.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.920]   Now, that doesn't sound like a lot of coverage
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.080]   for us here in the United States,
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.240]   but remember, in most foreign countries,
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.520]   the cost of healthcare is a small fraction
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.040]   of what it is here.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.320]   In addition to that,
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.400]   check with the country that you're going to
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   because, for instance,
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.600]   we've had clients travel to England,
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.040]   have had to use a hospital emergency room
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.040]   for an accident or something like that,
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.920]   didn't have any international coverage,
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.280]   and it turns out they didn't get charged anything anyway
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.360]   because it's a nationalized healthcare.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.240]   I don't know if that would be true of everywhere,
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.280]   or, well, I know it wouldn't be true of everywhere,
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.880]   but I don't know if it would be true of everybody
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.760]   traveling to England,
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.200]   but that was their experience there.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.160]   Now, as far as traveling around the country in an RV,
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.680]   if you have Medicare and a supplement plan,
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.240]   obviously no problem in finding somebody
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.520]   where you can use your recovery.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.200]   If you have a Medicare Advantage plan,
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.560]   you always have access to a hospital emergency room
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.080]   or an urgent care center, regardless of network.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:32.360]   Now, if you're gonna go somewhere outside of your home area
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:36.480]   and you're gonna stay there for a period of months,
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.400]   and you're gonna be on a Medicare Advantage plan,
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.920]   then you might consider heavily a PPO plan
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.400]   versus an HMO plan.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.000]   The PPO plan so that you can use it
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.880]   without a network providers.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.760]   And in addition to that,
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.080]   and I'll just use a couple of names,
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.560]   Humana and UnitedHealthcare
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.720]   both have national Medicare Advantage PPO networks.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.760]   So for instance, we have clients here in Texas
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.720]   who are originally from Wisconsin.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.520]   They spend the summer in Wisconsin.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.320]   They have a Humana PPO plan
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.280]   and they can visit their doctor up in Wisconsin
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.040]   who is also an in-network provider
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.200]   and it's at their in-network copay.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.440]   And because it's a PPO,
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.720]   they don't have to have a referral
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.520]   from the primary care physician here in Texas
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.600]   or anything like that.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.400]   - Okay, great.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.720]   So I'm personally curious if you can elaborate more
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.920]   on how to choose a good international plan
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.760]   and is there an equivalent of in-network,
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.840]   out of network when you're abroad?
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.640]   Do you benefit from searching
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.800]   who will accept this international plan?
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.960]   And if it's an emergency,
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   maybe you're not equipped to take the time
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.280]   and resources that you would at home.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.240]   - Yeah, so we represent basically one company that does that
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.600]   and it's a company called IM Global.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.000]   And you can just go online and look them up.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.720]   IM Global Health Insurance.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.160]   And they specialize in international health insurance.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.280]   And yes, they use a PPO system
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.760]   and they have network providers
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:11.080]   in most countries across the world.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.240]   - Okay, and then would it be subject
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.680]   to pre-existing conditions, medical evaluation?
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:20.040]   How thorough is being accepted?
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.000]   - Yeah, good question.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.120]   They have different products.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.640]   Some of those are subject to pre-existing conditions
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.200]   but there are others that are not subject
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.120]   to pre-existing conditions.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.120]   They just have a little bit more limited coverage.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:31.960]   - Okay, great.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.800]   Thank you.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.840]   Switching back, checking in with the audience.
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.480]   I don't see raised hands, so I'll continue.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.920]   Miriam, you let me know if we have chat questions.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.760]   - Yes.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.360]   - M, Hallie, would you like to ask your question
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.920]   or would you like me to ask it?
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.240]   - I can.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.640]   - Okay, we have a raised hand, DeGore.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:04.840]   - Okay, I heard M Hallie for a second,
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.880]   but then the audio-
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.840]   - Can you hear me now?
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.680]   - Yes, clearly.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.680]   Thank you.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.880]   - Hi, I hope this question isn't too specific.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.960]   It's a great program.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.520]   I appreciate y'all doing this.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.120]   My sister just turned 65.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.760]   She works for a large employer
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:23.160]   and her manager told her that she needed to sign up
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.320]   for Medicare Parts A and B,
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.840]   but she does have good health insurance.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.920]   And she just had to have surgery and we got to talking
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.400]   and I said, are you sure you need to sign up for Medicare?
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.480]   Because if you've got good health insurance,
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.960]   you might not need to.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.880]   I said, you ought to double check with HR and make sure.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.880]   So she called HR and they said that,
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.120]   no, she didn't have to sign up for Medicare Part A and B.
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:52.480]   She is a low income earner.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.920]   And so the $172 is somewhat difficult for her.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:01.080]   So I thought maybe she ought to cancel the Part B,
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:06.840]   but I wasn't 100% sure if that was the right thing to do.
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.000]   And also I sort of feel that she was, I don't know,
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.560]   given misinformation and signed up
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.280]   for the Medicare by mistake.
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.680]   And does Medicare ever give refunds on premiums?
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.280]   - Great questions.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:30.040]   So at this point, wow.
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:35.400]   Yes, so I would suggest going back to HR,
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.480]   let them know that she was advised by her manager
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.680]   to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.000]   and have them help her determine
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.360]   which is in her best interest,
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.280]   either to stay on the company plan or to get on Medicare
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.640]   and get a supplement plan or an advantage plan.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.360]   Now, if she decides to stay on the company plan,
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.000]   she can contact technically
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.840]   the Social Security Administration
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:03.600]   and have them disenroll her for Medicare Part B.
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.240]   She'll have to provide the reason being
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.920]   that she's still on an employer's group health plan.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.560]   But to my knowledge, they will not reimburse her
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.000]   for premiums that's already been charged
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.080]   for Medicare Part B.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.480]   Now, I may be wrong about that.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.760]   I just never heard of that being done before.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:21.680]   - Yeah, that's what I thought I read on medicare.gov,
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.240]   but I just wanted to make sure.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.080]   Now, right now she's on medical leave after surgery.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.800]   And so that doesn't end until next month.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.800]   And I guess there's a possibility
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.560]   that her job might've been filled
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.000]   while she's on medical leave.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.120]   So if she canceled the Medicare Part B now,
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.040]   and then next month she finds out
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.600]   that she can't go back to work,
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.080]   would that be a big problem to sign back up for it?
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:54.160]   - No, it shouldn't because upon termination
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.520]   of her group health coverage,
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:58.640]   it will open up what's called a special enrollment period
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.040]   for her to get back on Medicare Part B.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.280]   - Right, that was my understanding.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.000]   But again, I don't wanna steer it wrong.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.120]   - Right.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.080]   - How long is that enrollment period,
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.040]   that special enrollment period for her to sign up?
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.480]   - How long is it?
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.520]   - Yes, is it like does it go from the point
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:23.360]   where she stopped working for how many months
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.040]   does she have to sign up?
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:25.960]   - Oh, good question.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.440]   So it's not when she stops working,
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.280]   from the time her group health insurance coverage ends
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.600]   is 62 days.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:39.880]   - Great.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.400]   - Thank you so much.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.240]   - Thank you.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.920]   - So Miriam, do you wanna continue?
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.680]   I have other questions, but-
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.120]   - Well, I would say do we have any
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.040]   more raised hand questions?
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.600]   Anybody from the audience who would like to raise your hand
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.600]   and ask a question?
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.760]   - Jen.
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.360]   - Jen, Mary.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.200]   Oh.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.360]   - Hi, thank you so much for this forum.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.480]   I just had a question.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:10.520]   So if my parents are planning to live six months
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.240]   of the year in Florida and six months of the year
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:16.200]   in Virginia, and they currently have Kaiser
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.200]   as their supplement or their medical advantage plan,
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.680]   and there's no Kaiser in Florida,
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.280]   do they, so will they have to sign up
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:32.880]   for another supplemental plan for when they live in Florida
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.000]   and then use the Kaiser plan
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   when they come back to Virginia?
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.520]   - Well, in general terms, no.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.280]   They will need to decide on a plan
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.520]   and probably keep that plan no matter where they're staying.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.400]   So, and the plan that they're eligible to enroll in
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.600]   is gonna be based on their permanent residence,
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.320]   at least the resident address that they have on file
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.200]   with the Social Security Administration and with Medicare.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:07.000]   Now, do you know if their plan with Kaiser
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.840]   is an HMO or a PPO?
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.880]   - I think it's an HMO.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.200]   - Okay.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:18.600]   So if it's an HMO, then when they go to Florida,
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.240]   in all likelihood, their access to medical care
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:24.880]   is gonna be limited to either a hospital emergency room
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.680]   or an urgent care center.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:30.120]   And that may be okay, I don't know,
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.920]   but they may also check with Kaiser
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.440]   and see if they have any PPO plans available,
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.240]   and they could switch over to a PPO plan,
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.920]   which would give them more flexibility
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.120]   when they're down in Florida.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:44.160]   And by the way, we talked about this a little bit earlier,
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.000]   because they're on a Medicare Advantage plan
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.240]   beginning January 1 and going through March 31,
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.160]   there's an enrollment period
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.920]   called the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:58.320]   So they would have the opportunity to actually change
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.040]   in the first quarter of next year.
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:05.800]   - Okay. - Okay, Scott, great.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:06.640]   Thank you so much.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.920]   I'm sorry, one other quick question.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.120]   If they decide to move to Florida permanently,
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.960]   then obviously, since Kaiser's not in Florida,
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.280]   they would just need to change their Medicare Advantage plan,
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.960]   like you said, to another Medicare Advantage plan
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.320]   that would potentially work in Florida.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.480]   - That's absolutely correct.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.760]   And of course, when they move,
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.760]   they would certainly get a special enrollment period
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.400]   to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan in Florida,
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.040]   or if they chose, they would have
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.000]   what's called a guaranteed issue scenario
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.800]   into a Medicare supplement plan down there.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.440]   So they'd have a lot of options available to them.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.560]   - Okay, and if you move states,
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.080]   do you have to re-enroll in Medicare Part AB,
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.280]   or no, you just, that foundation just stays,
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.000]   and then you just change your address
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.880]   and re-enroll in a new Medicare Advantage, right?
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.480]   - Right, so Medicare Part A and Part B
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:02.400]   being a federal program, once you're enrolled,
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.200]   as long as you take no action with that,
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:08.560]   which you shouldn't, you just stay enrolled.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.760]   Moving doesn't impact that at all.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.160]   - Okay, thank you so much.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.560]   - Sure.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.640]   - Great.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.440]   I saw a hand from Mary, but it's since disappeared.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.720]   So I'll ask this question
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.600]   'cause it dovetails with the prior.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.360]   When can I change my Part A, Part B, Part D,
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.480]   or Medicaid Advantage, Medicare Advantage, or Medigap?
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.200]   - Okay, Medicare Part A, Part B,
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.840]   for the vast majority of people,
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.000]   once you're enrolled,
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.800]   you typically won't change those things.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.360]   So that should not be an issue.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:45.240]   If you enroll in a Medicare supplement/Medigap plan,
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.720]   in the vast majority of states,
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:50.120]   you can change those any time of year that you choose.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.800]   Now, in most states,
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.120]   once you're outside of your Medicare supplement
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:56.040]   open enrollment period,
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.800]   there will be medical underwriting involved
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.520]   in changing from one supplement plan
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.400]   to another supplement plan.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:05.280]   On your Medicare prescription drug plans,
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.560]   you'll get what's called an initial enrollment period
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.600]   when you first enroll in Medicare.
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.400]   After that, you get the opportunity
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.080]   to change plans every year,
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.400]   but only during the Medicare annual enrollment period,
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.040]   October 15th through December the 7th.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.920]   And then Medicare Advantage, as we just said,
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.720]   same annual enrollment period,
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.560]   October 15th through December 7th.
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.000]   And then in addition to that,
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.800]   a Medicare Advantage open enrollment period,
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.120]   which runs from January 1 through March 31.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.280]   Did I cover all the bases, Gloria?
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.440]   - So Part A, Part B, Part D,
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.680]   Medicare Advantage, or Medigap?
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:42.040]   - Okay, I think so.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.040]   - Okay, great. - Thanks.
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:48.440]   - Mary, your hand was previously raised, but now-
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.720]   - I have your question here.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.720]   - Okay, great.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.400]   - In dealing with, she says,
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.240]   in dealing with a fairly complex medical care
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.120]   for a family member,
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:02.120]   I am often quoted Medicare rules for accessing care,
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:07.320]   such as cardiac rehab or skilled nursing facilities
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:11.040]   on the number of days and length of time.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:15.240]   Is there a publication to actually read the rules?
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:19.520]   - Well, Medicare and you will address,
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.280]   certainly skilled nursing care.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:25.200]   And I can just tell you that Medicare will allow
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.400]   up to a hundred days of skilled nursing care per year.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.440]   And understand skilled nursing care,
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.320]   while it may happen in a setting like a nursing home,
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:37.880]   is not long-term nursing home care.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.640]   Medicare doesn't cover any part of that.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.200]   As far as cardiac rehab,
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.160]   I'm kind of at a loss on that one.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.280]   That's not the kind of situation
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.400]   I normally get asked or address.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.840]   And don't know that Medicare and you
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.360]   is gonna go into address that question.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.000]   It may be something you'll just have to ask
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.400]   a medical provider about.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:03.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:11.360]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:18.960]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:23.720]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:29.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:36.640]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:42.320]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:46.380]   (upbeat music)
