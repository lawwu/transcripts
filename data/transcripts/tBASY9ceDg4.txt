[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   For a while, I've been fascinated by how our gut microbiome can have such a visible impact on our
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.160]   lives, affecting everything from energy to immunity to inflammation and even our mood.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.240]   But for all the buzz around gut health, it is still a black box for most of us,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.920]   and I wanted to go deeper. So today I'm talking with Dr. Robin Chutkin, a board-certified
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.800]   gastroenterologist, founder of the Digestive Center for Wellness, and author of several books
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.680]   on the microbiome. She's treated thousands of patients over three decades and brings a perspective
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.700]   that's both clinically grounded and refreshingly practical. As she puts it,
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.220]   There is no brain health, no immune health, no lung health without gut health.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.900]   In this episode, we're going to explore what your gut might be trying to tell you,
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.140]   from reflux or bloating to what your stool says about your health. We'll also cover how probiotics,
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.780]   fermented vegetables, hydration, fiber, and more actually impact your digestion,
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.160]   and whether washing your hands or sanitizing too much might be doing more harm than good.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.300]   I'm Chris Hutchins. If you enjoy this episode, please share it with a friend or leave a comment

[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.780]   Robin, why is gut health such a critical part of our health?
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.600]   Chris, I want you to look down at your belly and see where your gut is located. It is right in the
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.100]   center of your body. It is literally the engine for your entire body, for your brain to function,
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.740]   your kidneys, your lungs, your liver, your immune system. So if your gut health is off,
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.420]   it means your body is not functioning properly. Now, I know you went to Yale for pre-med,
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.840]   Columbia for med school. How much of your medical training and education even touched on the gut?
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:45.380]   Less than 1%. Less than 1%. And less than 0.01% of my training and education touched on what we
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.540]   should be eating and how we should be feeding this incredible engine that's fueling our entire body.
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.480]   And so what are some of the common myths or misconceptions that people might not
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.280]   be thinking correctly about their gut?
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.860]   The gut for most people is this black box. Like they don't understand it. They think,
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.160]   I'm just going to throw some stuff in there and hope that it works. So they don't understand this
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.520]   basic idea of input and output that you put in something at the top through your mouth and something
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.420]   comes out at the bottom through your anus. And everything that happens in between your mouth and
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.100]   your anus is dependent on the input. So the input really informs the output. And I think people are
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.740]   just guessing and they're just kind of throwing stuff against the wall of their gut and hoping for
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.200]   the best.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.920]   And what's actually going on inside the gut? How do we think about all the bacteria? And I guess like
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.780]   maybe a one-on-one, a one-on-one on gut health for people.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.660]   The first thing I want people to know is that the gut actually starts right at the top with the mouth.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.880]   And that's where digestion happens. And in fact, even before the food hits your mouth,
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.740]   you start digesting. The sight of food, the smell of food, sometimes even the thought of food can
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.560]   start to release enzymes from our salivary glands. So as soon as a food hits the mouth, it starts to
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.600]   get digested. And of course, we chew it up in our mouth and then it travels down the esophagus.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.280]   Food hits the stomach. It gets churned up into something called chyme. And again,
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.460]   more enzymes, gastrin, lots of different enzymes, hydrochloric acid. After the stomach,
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.340]   it goes into the small intestine. And then we get to the large intestine, sometimes called the colon.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.260]   And one of the interesting things is that even though it's one continuous tube from your mouth
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.120]   to your anus, all the different parts work completely differently. They have different
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.260]   lining, different epithelium. So for example, in the esophagus, you have a squamous lining,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.320]   which is very sensitive to acid because there's not supposed to be acid in your esophagus.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.040]   In the stomach, you have a columnar lining, which is resistant to acid. Different parts release
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.900]   different enzymes. Different parts can churn up food differently. So it's very specialized,
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.220]   even though it's all connected.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.000]   So what are some of the kind of main roles this entire gut system plays in maintaining our health?
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.740]   I'm sort of embarrassed to say that I had been a gastroenterologist about 15 years before I figured
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.240]   out this one simple, incredible thing. And that is that when something is in your GI tract,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.600]   it's not actually in your body. It's in this hollow tube that goes from your mouth to your anus and
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.740]   bisects your body. And so one of the main functions of the GI tract beyond digesting and absorbing the food,
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.600]   it's to keep things that get into our body through our mouth. So that could be pollen, it could be
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.580]   poison, it's bacteria, it's viruses, to keep those things in this hollow tube running the whole length
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.880]   of our body and to prevent them from getting absorbed through the gut lining into our body where they can
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.700]   get through our bloodstream to different organs. The lining is not just this passive thing. It's only
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.460]   one cell thick, but it's very active. And so it kind of knows what it should let through,
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.240]   what it shouldn't. The gut bacteria help with that. So that's one of the first things. It's a defense
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.860]   to prevent things from getting into the rest of our body. And then, of course, digestion, right? So
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.220]   the food gets churned up, enzymes get released, different macro and micronutrients get passed
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.920]   through the gut lining into the bloodstream where they feed all your other organs, your brain and your
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.700]   lungs and your immune system, et cetera. We also have stomach acid, which isn't just essential for
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.880]   digestion. Stomach acid literally kills pathogens. So there was a study that was done in 2021 and it
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.460]   showed that people who are blocking stomach acid with these potent drugs called proton pump
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:35.300]   inhibitors, those people had a two to four fold increased risk of getting sick with COVID when they
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.380]   were exposed to the virus. Because normally when you have intact stomach acid, you swallow SARS-CoV-2,
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.740]   you can breathe it in, but you can also swallow it. And then that stomach acid unravels a viral protein
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.940]   and inactivates it. And it does it for all kinds of different viruses. It can protect you from poliovirus
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.300]   and from different bacteria. And when I say protect, I mean lower incidence compared to not like I'm
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.340]   bulletproof. I have stomach acid. Viruses can't make me sick. So that's just a huge difference right
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.740]   there. But that wasn't really news, Chris, because we knew from decades ago from cruise ship outbreaks
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:17.160]   of norovirus and things like that, we could always predict who would get sick. And sure, older people,
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.340]   babies, but people who don't have stomach acid, people who are taking that Nexium and, you know,
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.860]   their Prevacid and thinking, this is fantastic. I can eat a cheeseburger at 10 o'clock and I don't have
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:36.300]   reflux. And yeah, that's true. But unfortunately, the flip side is that it makes you more vulnerable
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.320]   to pathogens, to bacteria, to viruses, to foodborne illnesses.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.780]   And so that's a little bit of the negative of an unhealthy gut. What are some of the positives of
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.620]   a really healthy gut that can impact your life or your health?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.160]   I think the gut immune connection is one of the most important. And because we are seeing such an
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.260]   epidemic of autoimmune disease, we are seeing that one in four Americans have an autoimmune disease.
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.700]   So things that affect our skin, like psoriasis and eczema, things that affect our gut, like Crohn's and
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.160]   ulcerative colitis and celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, which can affect the joints and the
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.260]   kidneys and the skin, MS. And it turns out that our gut health is really at the heart of that,
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:24.220]   of that explosion of autoimmune disease. And the story of how we figured that out really comes from
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:31.380]   something called the hygiene hypothesis. And if we go back a little bit to the 1950s in the United
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:37.720]   Kingdom, they were starting to see this explosion of autoimmune disease. So they had this epidemiologist
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.420]   from the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, Dr. David Straughan, and they asked him to do a
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.600]   study to figure out why they were seeing so much, they call it hay fever, but essentially asthma and
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:57.020]   eczema. And he did a 21-year study. He looked at 18,000 kids from birth to age 21. The first discovery
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:03.600]   was that kids who lived in large households with extended family, cousins, lots of other kids who
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.580]   were getting sick all the time, like your cousin sneezed on you and now you're sick or, you know,
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:14.620]   somebody gave you a virus. Those kids, they had much lower rates of autoimmune disease when they
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.360]   grew up. The immune system was being trained by these frequent illnesses. So that was the first
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.100]   surprising thing. The second surprising thing was that kids who were more affluent, who lived in houses
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.760]   with better access to showers and things like that, who were cleaner essentially, who were bathing all the
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.620]   time, those kids had much higher rates of autoimmune diseases as adults. So what the hygiene hypothesis
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.780]   told us, and it took us till the 1980s to figure this out from his study, is that exposure to childhood
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:48.280]   germs is important for creating a balanced immune response later on. That's not going to freak out
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:55.560]   and develop an autoimmune disease. And number two, that being super cleaned, being super sanitized
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:02.340]   is not good. It can also create a problem with the immune system. And the really interesting thing is
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.980]   that if we look at a map of the world today, we see high rates of autoimmune disease in the more
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:13.420]   developed countries like the U.S. and Canada and Western Europe and Australia. And we see really low
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:20.120]   rates in sub-Saharan Africa and India and Southeast Asia. But as countries become more industrialized,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.680]   as they get super clean and also eat more processed food, more medicines, etc., you start to see the rates
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.920]   of autoimmune disease rising. So we're seeing, for example, increasing rates of autoimmune diseases in
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.480]   India, in parts of the Middle East. And that it's due to a lot of things, but part of it, a huge part
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:45.000]   of it is this sort of super sanitation and people getting very clean and also sort of cleansing their
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.560]   bodies with all these personal care products and cleansing their homes with things that are removing a lot of the
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.240]   healthy microbes.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:57.060]   Okay, so I have a thousand questions, but I want to take a quick pause because we have two young kids at
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:02.920]   home. And I would say, you know, culturally in the States with young kids, it's like sanitize their hands
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.920]   all the time. They're always touching gross stuff. Just the other day, my daughter, you know, was in the
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.360]   bathroom dancing and fell on the floor and then just started rolling around in a public bathroom on the
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:19.600]   floor. You know, very rarely does it seem like kids are using public, even public water fountains.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.380]   They're all bringing water bottles. You know, where's the balance, right? I assume that if
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.960]   someone's rolling around on the floor of the bathroom, they should probably wash their hands,
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.640]   but maybe you don't need to sanitize their hands 15 times a day. And maybe they don't need to shower,
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.320]   you know, once or twice every single day. How do you strike that balance?
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:42.920]   Yeah, it's such an important balance. Generally now, I see these kids with a hand sanitizer hanging off
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.960]   their backpack and I'm like, oh no. First of all, there are things in some of these hand sanitizers,
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.380]   triclosan and other things that are endocrine disrupting chemicals. So I'd much rather take my
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:11:00.180]   chances with dirt than with triclosan for my kid, number one. And if you look at how young babies are,
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:05.040]   they put everything in their mouth. That is an instinct. That's not, oh, they're misbehaving or
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.980]   they didn't get the memo. They do that because that is how they're interacting with their environment.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.200]   They are putting things in their mouth to get microbes into their body. And that's an important
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.380]   part of childhood. But what do we do? We take it away and we sanitize it and we put chemicals all
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:26.980]   over it. And we're like, now you can touch it. So getting dirty is not only good, it's essential.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:32.460]   And there's a great book out there called Last Child in the Woods, Nature Deficit Disorder. I think
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.600]   it's by Richard Louvy. And, you know, we're all sort of focused on the screens and the kids are on
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.380]   computers too much of the time. And that's all true. But the bigger issue is they're not outside
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:47.800]   getting dirty, interacting with nature. Because after our initial journey through the birth canal,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.920]   those of us who are lucky enough to be born vaginally, that's when we get colonized with a
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.200]   mother's good bacteria. And that forms the beginnings of our foundational microbiome.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:05.620]   So after that, we then need to get those microbes from nature, from food, ideally that's grown in dirt,
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:11.600]   and from getting dirty ourselves, from, you know, being out there with grass and trees and all of
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.100]   it. And we see that kids who are born in the hospital via C-section, who don't get the benefit
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:24.780]   of coming through the birth canal, they are colonized with hospital-acquired staff instead of the mother's
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:31.240]   healthy bifidobacterium lactobacillus. And interestingly, Chris, for years after birth, they have higher rates
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:37.760]   of allergies, of asthma, of autoimmune disease, and of obesity. And if you add a kid who was born
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.780]   by C-section and then not nursed formula, you see all of those really go up.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:49.060]   This episode is brought to you by Quince. Father's Day is tough because my dad has good taste but seems

[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.480]   all over the internet, you really need to check out Delete Me this year. Unfortunately, there's hundreds
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.860]   of data brokers online that are constantly sharing and selling your personal info and keeping track of
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:17.060]   all of them is like playing whack-a-mole. But fortunately, if you go to them one by one, you can get them to
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:23.160]   remove your data. However, that process can take hours and hours to do yourself. I know I tried it
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.980]   two years ago. And after spending more than 10 hours and not even getting close to finishing,
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:33.620]   I gave up and started using Delete Me and I haven't looked back. Since then, I've signed up my entire
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:38.640]   family because Delete Me will not just find and remove your personal info from hundreds of data broker
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:44.620]   websites. They'll continuously scan for new data that shows up, which sadly happens all the time,
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:50.960]   and get that removed as well. On average, they find and remove over 2000 pieces of personal info for a
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.320]   customer in their first two years. And to date, they've done over 100 million data removals for

[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:18.420]   Okay. So I'm still thinking I've got these two kids and I'm going to ask one more follow up. So on
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:24.080]   one hand, you're touching dog poop. You're in the bathroom. Got to wash your hands. On the other hand,
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.800]   like you're playing in the dirt. Don't wash your hands. How do you feel about the middle ground? You
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:35.380]   know, riding public buses, you know, wiping down the seats and the tray tables on an airplane. Like
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:41.680]   where are the kind of public places like the, you know, the railing on the subway? How do you feel about
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.920]   those? Are those good germs?
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:49.120]   Those are fine. They're fine. I mean, I don't know that I can make a strong case that the germs on the
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.520]   railing on the subway are good for your child. But here's the thing. Your kids have a healthy immune
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.960]   system. I'm assuming that they don't have an immune deficiency syndrome or anything like that. And
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.320]   it's training the same way that we want our kids to learn grit and resilience socially.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:10.060]   It's important for them physically also. So when I see the parents hand sanitizer on the tray and all
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.400]   of that, that, I mean, I don't know what's going on with that kid. That kid could have a very serious
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.200]   immune deficiency syndrome or some other reason, but most of the time it's a terrible idea.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:27.340]   It's a terrible idea because the kid is not catching Ebola from the tray. And what we have,
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:35.500]   what we clearly know now is that being too clean is worse than being dirty by far, by far. So the
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:41.800]   bathing too, like your kids, um, you know, let them get dirty. It's great. Like a dog is a lot of work.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.920]   So I'm not advocating for a dog if you don't have one, but there's studies that show that households
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.580]   with children who have dogs, the kids end up on fewer antibiotics. They have fewer autoimmune diseases
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.320]   because a dog is bringing some dirt and some outdoors into your house.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:01.340]   So to circle back to the gut, we talked about a lot of the benefits of a healthy gut. How does someone
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.000]   even know if they have a healthy gut?
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.500]   There are some really important feedback loops in the body and the gut has a lot of them. So for example,
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.880]   I talked about reflux earlier on, if you are having heartburn, it is not because you're overproducing
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.520]   acid. That doesn't happen. Overproduction of acid is a very rare disorder called Zollinger-Ellison
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.540]   syndrome that occurs in about one in a million people, which means that maybe 380 people in the US have
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.780]   overproduction of acid for the other, you know, many millions who have heartburn. It's because they're
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.820]   having inappropriate opening of that lower esophageal sphincter. Why is it opening inappropriately?
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:44.260]   Eating too late at night, eating too much food, too much caffeine, too much alcohol. So overfilling
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:50.960]   the stomach causes a valve to pop open and things like caffeine and alcohol, nicotine also can make
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.940]   that valve open. But what do we do? We go out and we take these acid blockers instead of paying
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:02.100]   attention to that. When you have reflux, it's not because your body is not working. Your body is giving
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.040]   you really important feedback and saying, hey, that eight o'clock meal that you're having every night
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:12.560]   and then you're lying on the couch, not a great idea. Or that extra cup of coffee or the second
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:18.260]   glass of wine or whatever it is. So that's an important part of feedback higher up. Constipation
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:24.160]   is also really important feedback. Constipation on its own isn't a disease, it's a symptom. And it's a
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:31.180]   symptom that either you're not putting in the right output to get the desired output, you're not hydrating
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.800]   enough. So things are kind of getting stuck along the way. Maybe you're taking a medication that's
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:41.480]   slowing down your gut motility. Maybe your gut microbiome is off. Maybe you need more core
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   ab strength to really help push things along. Often it is a medicine cabinet. And so when somebody comes
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.200]   to see me with something like bloating and constipation, which are really common GI symptoms,
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:19:00.300]   irregularity, the first place I go is a medicine cabinet. Because, for example, a lot of vitamins can cause
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.560]   gut distress. They can slow down gut motility. Anything containing iron in it is going to slow
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:11.660]   down. Your gut motility can make you constipated. Calcium-containing supplements, et cetera, can also
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:17.380]   do that. Prescription medications, pain medications, of course, can slow down the gut. But even medications
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:22.100]   you might not think about, like antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, those often cause bloating
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:27.640]   and constipation. There are medications that people are on for high blood pressure that do it. So the list is
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:33.580]   really long. And we're just talking about causing constipation. If we look at now messing up the gut
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:39.400]   microbiome, there was a study that was published in the journal Nature, and they looked at 41 different
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:45.300]   medications, and they found that half of them were causing problems in the gut microbiome, including
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:50.860]   things like laxatives that, you know, you think, okay, I have a slow gut. I'm going to take a laxative. You
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:56.340]   don't think the laxative is actually messing up your microbiome. Artificial sweeteners, anti-anxiety
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.760]   drugs like Prozac. So the list is really long. So the medicine cabinet is one of the first places I go.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:07.900]   And then you have to think about, okay, hormonally, is there something going on? Is my thyroid underactive?
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.460]   And that's why my gut motility is slow. So it's always a good idea. Check your thyroid function.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:18.060]   If you are suddenly finding you're more constipated, things are slowed down. So could it be something
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:24.260]   hormonal like that? Could you be in perimenopause? Probably not you, Chris, but I certainly could.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:30.700]   So, you know, is there a change in your internal hormonal milieu that's causing your gut to behave
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:36.540]   differently? So is it something hormonal? Is it something physiological? Do you have a mass,
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.820]   a tumor or something that's pressing on your gut? Or it could be something more benign, like a uterine
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:46.420]   fibroid. So really important to play medical detective. I'm not saying don't go to the doctor and don't take a
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:52.880]   drug, but figure out what's causing it rather than I'm just going to take this, this thing. And my
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:21:01.160]   second book, no, my third book is called, uh, the bloat cure 101 things. And each one is a page and
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.120]   it's a disease. So a is like air aphasia, air swallowing that could be causing it, you know,
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.440]   and it goes through all these different causes from food intolerances to hormonal things,
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.760]   to anatomical things, voluptuous venous colon being one of mine. Women have a twistier colon,
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:22.260]   but it's so important for people to literally like roll up their sleeves and be medical detective
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:28.420]   because unfortunately, Chris, the reality is that the medical community just does not have the time
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:34.460]   for that. That is not the way we are oriented to practice medicine in 2025. It's like, okay,
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:39.160]   this is wrong here. Take this. It's not like, okay, let's talk about how much water you're drinking,
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.020]   how much fiber you're having in your diet. Are you moving your body? Are you taking an iron
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:48.160]   supplement that's slowing you down? So my goal is I want to put the tools in people's hands. So,
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:54.580]   you know, read the bloat cure if you're bloated and in those 101 pages, hopefully you'll find what's
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:59.280]   bloating you or my first book gut bliss, which sort of explains all these different things going on in
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.780]   the GI tract. And so again, very clear. I'm not saying don't go see a doctor, but I think it's so
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:11.840]   important for people to understand how their GI tract works. What are the things that are basically
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.040]   making it behave badly, go wrong, and how can they fix it?
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.720]   Let's say you don't have any of that. Like you're not bloating right now. You're not constipated.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:26.620]   Everything seems to be working. Is there still opportunity to improve your gut? And is there a
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.620]   way to diagnose whether you're like, you know, on the brink of things going wrong or you're really,
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:36.820]   you know, you're, you're an A plus. I do also want to mention in addition to GI symptoms. So
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:42.240]   the reflux, the burping, the bloating, the constipation, loose stool, um, irregular bowels,
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.960]   it's also your immune system. Cause we talked about that close connection. And when I mentioned that,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.020]   you know, the gut lining is only one cell thick, you have all the trillions of microbes on one side
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:57.480]   of the gut. And then you have the immune system on the other, you have all those cells that are
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.160]   releasing the cytokines, et cetera, on the other, and they're in constant communication. So when we
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.820]   see that the gut microbiome, for example, is disrupted, because let's say you took a massive
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.980]   course of antibiotics and you've wiped out a lot of your gut bacteria, or you've been eating a crummy
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.400]   diet for years with not enough fiber and too much processed food, and your microbiome is a bit off.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.500]   That is potentially going to affect your immune system. Maybe it's an autoimmune disease.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:28.020]   Maybe it is, you're getting sick frequently, you're having lots of coughs and colds. And so that's an
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:33.400]   important clue also, that something could be up with the gut. And it doesn't mean not everybody who
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:39.920]   has an autoimmune disease has an unhealthy gut, but autoimmune diseases are often born in the gut.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:46.220]   Frequently, there's a genetic predisposition, but there is some kind of trigger, and the trigger is
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:51.160]   often happening in the gut. So that's an important consideration too. If you, or if you have a kid who's
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:57.600]   sick all the time to think about what's going on in the gut, I really don't advocate for a lot of gut
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:05.300]   testing because it's kind of like whole genome testing. So in the 35 years or 40 years since we've
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:10.540]   been able to sequence the entire human genome, an incredible project, the Human Genome Project,
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:18.280]   that took multiple institutions globally, billions of dollars, were able to sequence the entire human
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.260]   genome. And how many genetic diseases do you think we've been able to cure since we've been able to
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.520]   sequence the entire human genome?
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.880]   I'm going to at least assume one, but I feel like your answer is going to be zero.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.600]   It's a big donut because the genes are just a part of it. So it's the same thing. And just to sort of
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.260]   define the microbiome a little bit for people who may be a little less familiar, we're talking about all
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:47.100]   the organisms that live in and on our body, mostly in our gut, but they're also on our skin, on our scalp.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.040]   They're even in our lungs. They're in our bladder. They're everywhere. They're under our nails.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:57.540]   And we're talking about bacteria, but also viruses, parasites, fungal organisms, archaea.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:03.620]   So multiple different organisms. We can't see them, but if we scraped them all up, the ones in our gut,
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:09.280]   they'd weigh about three to four pounds. It's over a hundred trillion. We have somewhere around two to
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:17.000]   three times as many microbial cells as we have human cells. So we're sort of more microbe than human when
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.280]   you think about it. We're like the beehive kind of inanimate. And then the microbes are all the bees.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:28.800]   So we're talking, and then all the genetic materials, a big density of stuff. And what do
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:34.660]   they do? Well, they digest food. They help to synthesize vitamins like vitamin K. They help to
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:39.360]   neutralize toxins. They train the immune system, the whole hygiene hypothesis we were talking about,
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:45.360]   and they turn genes on and off. So Chris, you could have a genetic predisposition for a disease,
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.060]   but because of the complement of your microbiome, you don't develop the disease because the microbiome
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:56.640]   can inactivate those genes. So you could have an identical twin, identical genetic material,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:03.320]   and you have a disease and they don't, or vice versa, because your gut microbiome is influencing
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.920]   disease expression. So you would think with all of that, like, all right, bring on the microbiome
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:15.700]   testing. Let's figure out what's going on. No. And that's because we are, this is in its infancy.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:22.000]   So we've identified maybe a thousand or more, a few thousand species in the gut, but they're probably
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.420]   hundreds of thousands. And then just identifying the species isn't enough. We have to understand
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.600]   the metabolites and what they do. And sometimes bacteria can go from making one thing to making
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:38.860]   something else as an adaptive response based on a change in the environment. So it's really premature
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:45.880]   to go and get a microbiome, a stool microbiome test and think that, oh, it's going to tell you
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:52.060]   everything you need to know. What I do recommend to people is to be citizen scientists, to contribute to
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:57.100]   the research through organizations like the American Gut Project, which is a nonprofit. For less than a hundred
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.360]   bucks, you can send your stool in. They'll do an analysis. They're not going to then try and sell
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.140]   you a bunch of supplements or tell you, you know, you can't eat blackberries. So a lot of the commercial
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:13.040]   testing, it gives recommendations that I think are really misleading and erroneous. And then there's a
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:19.840]   whole upsell of like, take this product and it's going to fix your microbiome. So I think if people want
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.100]   to do it because it's interesting, contribute to the science. So the American Gut Project, their database
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:30.400]   is open to researchers all over the world. And so for example, somebody studying Parkinson's disease
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:36.180]   can look at stool samples and the microbiome of people with Parkinson's disease to figure out that
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:42.420]   actually Parkinson's begins in the gut, believe it or not. They published data about six years ago,
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:49.580]   the American Gut Project study. And that was the largest microbiome study done ever. It was over
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:55.640]   10,000 people, over 40 different countries asking the question, what makes a healthy microbiome?
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:06.200]   And the answer was, drum roll, people who ate 30 or more different plants per week had the healthiest
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.200]   gut microbiome. You didn't have to be vegan or even vegetarian. They were vegans with really unhealthy
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:17.080]   microbiomes, vegans who were eating typically less than 10 different plants per week. And they were
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:23.100]   straight up omnivores, but who were eating a wide variety of plant matter. And so that's not just
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:29.840]   vegetables, it's fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, seeds, herbs, spices, all of it. So
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.940]   basically having a varied diet. And it's the same kind of stuff that Dan Buettner found with Blue Zones,
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:42.020]   right? Is having a wide variety of different plants in your diet is really where it's at.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:48.240]   Okay. And so I know there are these tests. I think Jonah, Tiny Health are a couple of them. I'm looking
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.640]   at a couple of these websites because I want to understand. And I've had friends that have taken
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:57.580]   them and it's like, oh, like you're going to learn how healthy your gut is and what supplements you need.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.900]   As someone who studied this a lot, are you kind of like, there's just not enough evidence to support
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:08.960]   what you would do? So maybe it's more like 23andMe where you can learn about all the bacteria, but
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:15.580]   like, what do you do with that? Or is there a person for whom these tests are really interesting
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.880]   or are they really just, you know, wrapping away to sell more supplements?
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:25.680]   The latter. I try to direct people away from the commercial microbiome companies where the whole
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.500]   goal is kind of what you said, an upsell of supplements and things that are just sort of
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:37.160]   nonsensical. And the problem too, is that it kind of takes people's focus away from what they actually
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:42.620]   can do, which is overuse of antibiotics and acid blockers is a huge threat to the microbiome.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:48.860]   A diet without enough fiber, huge threat, too much alcohol, processed foods, all the things that you
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:53.980]   would imagine. But when somebody gets this result and they're like, oh, you just have to take the
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:59.300]   supplement. It makes them think like, oh, I don't have to do these other things. You know, I just take
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:04.160]   this pill. And so that I think is really, that's problematic.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:12.820]   Yeah. I have not done one. I'm like curious as a curious person, but it just reminds me of 23andMe
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.740]   where it was like, you likely have blue eyes. And I was like, well, I knew that one. You know,
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:23.240]   here's your earwax type. It was like kind of fun things, but it was more fun than I didn't change
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.420]   anything about my life because of it. Yeah. And we see what, what, what's, you know,
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:33.740]   that company's going through. Right. And so a lot of this, I mean, I think a lot of these folks,
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.800]   some of the microbiome testing companies were started by really good researchers and I think
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.080]   they start out well-intentioned, but that there's always that line, right? Like, you know, oh, if we
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:49.040]   say this and we do this and because they're marketing something, you know, they're not there as healthcare
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:56.500]   providers. They're there to sell a product. And so there's almost always some over-promising and
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:01.900]   under-delivering on that end. But again, I do encourage, especially people, whether you're healthy,
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:08.260]   you look like you would have really good poo and a good microbiome or for somebody who has an autoimmune
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:14.260]   disease and wants to see, or wants to get it checked and then is planning on making some intervention,
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:20.840]   it can be helpful, but it's not predictive. So you can make a ton of changes and you may not see any
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:26.520]   significant changes in your microbiome. And you could make no changes in your diet and your microbiome
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.960]   could still shift because there are other things that are informing it. Our environment,
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.040]   our exposures, the stress in our life, all of this stuff affects the microbiome.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.000]   I think there are some foods that everyone knows, like it's probably better to not eat all, you know,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.360]   processed food and it's good to eat whole foods. Are there any things that are surprising,
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:50.400]   controversial, or more in the middle where people, it's not so definitive that are things people should
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:56.820]   be either thinking about or testing on themselves to see how their body reacts to certain foods?
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:02.140]   I'm going to make a lot of people really unhappy right now by saying that kombucha
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:07.820]   does not improve the health of your gut microbiome. We have no convincing evidence. However,
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:15.400]   this is important. If you are swapping out soda or alcohol for kombucha, that's a win,
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.800]   right? Because we know that soda, any amount is terrible for the gut. And we know that alcohol
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.880]   is bactericidal. It kills bacteria. It doesn't mean that it's terrible depending on how much you're
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:31.100]   drinking, but alcohol is a killer of gut bacteria. So if you're trying to drink less and you're like,
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   hmm, I'm going to swap, you know, a couple beers I have at night or my usual cocktail for kombucha,
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.320]   great. But the idea that you're going to drink the kombucha and it's sort of regenerating your gut
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:50.260]   microbiome, no. One of the most effective foods beyond the general, like you want to eat food that
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:57.860]   didn't come from a factory, right? Ideally, is fermented foods. Unbelievable. And the Sonnenbergs at
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:03.340]   Stanford, a husband and wife couple have done a lot of great work on this. So a fermented food like
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:12.260]   sauerkraut is a triple threat in a good way. It's prebiotics, meaning it's a food that the bacteria
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.920]   eat because it contains fiber. If we look at something like sauerkraut, it's cabbage, right? So
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:22.260]   it has prebiotic foods in it, the actual cabbage. It has probiotics, live bacteria, because in the
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:27.800]   fermentation process, you're generating lactobacillus. And it has postbiotics, which are
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.660]   things like short chain fatty acids that are all the compounds that are being made by the bacteria as
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:38.540]   they're fermented. So a jar of like really good quality sauerkraut, not like a pasteurized, you
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:44.520]   know, factory made one, but like, let's say you get something from the farmer's market or that is one of
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:50.140]   the most medicinal foods you can eat. And I'm very skeptical, like the whole, you know, acai berry and
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:54.820]   like, yeah, the whole superfood thing is so overdone. But there is such great scientific
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:34:04.200]   evidence for something like sauerkraut or even fermented vegetables. I have in my second book,
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:09.980]   the microbiome solution, which is actually my favorite. I have some great recipes in there.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.180]   And we borrowed some recipes from Jeff Cox's great book, The Essential Book of Fermentation
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:21.480]   for the fermented food recipes. They're delicious. Like there's an apple and cabbage
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:26.760]   sauerkraut in there. That's fantastic. Fermenting stuff is pretty simple. You need a mason jar,
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:34.700]   you need water and salt. And you can ferment almost any vegetable, or you can do what I do and go to the
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:40.120]   farmer's market and buy some from somebody who's done it. But it's incredible. And you only need like
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:47.220]   a tablespoon. So even if you don't like sauerkraut, if you can commit to like a tablespoon of sauerkraut
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.080]   or kimchi, incredible. Yeah, you were saying sauerkraut the whole time. And I was like,
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.760]   I don't love sauerkraut, but I love kimchi. And do the kids, will the kids eat it? Because so good for
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:02.960]   them. TBD. Kids don't like spicy, but they don't mind fermented. And we went to Vietnamese restaurant
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.740]   yesterday and the kids usually eat whatever we order as long as it's not too spicy. Wonderful.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.020]   So we have not crossed the spice hurdle, but everything else seems to work.
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:18.060]   Yeah, the kids menu is ruinous to children's guts. So if you can, if you can do that, I encourage your
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.840]   kids to just have a little taste of what you're having rather than the, you know, the chicken tenders
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:27.000]   and the tater tots and the mac and cheese. That's fantastic. Full credit to my wife who had the kind
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.440]   of like 100 foods in 100 days plan, where when our daughters first started eating solid foods,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.380]   there was a goal that in the first 100 days, we wanted to expose them to 100 different foods.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:43.260]   And these are like raw ingredients, not like a Twinkie, an Oreo, that kind of thing, like a vegetable,
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:48.020]   a fish or, you know, a legume or something. And I was surprised by the time you get to 100,
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:52.060]   you're kind of going out there. We weren't necessarily counting every single fish in the
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.020]   sea. But even then, that's, you know, that's not going to get you to 100. So it was like every
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:01.520]   vegetable, every fruit, we'd go to some of the kind of markets from other countries to try to
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.800]   find fruits and vegetables that we don't normally get. And I, it was awesome. And I think now there
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:12.600]   are things our kids don't like, but you know, they'll always try something. So we've, we've tried
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:18.060]   hard to expose our kids to a ton of food. And so far it's been successful, except spice.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:24.600]   I love that your, your wife was actually basically following that American Gut Project data of 30
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.740]   different plant foods per week, even the bonus version of that with a hundred without knowing
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:34.360]   that data, but just inherently was like, it's good for my kid to eat a wide variety of foods.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.720]   It's incredible. Yeah. We just wanted them to try everything. Now the downside is the more we expose
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:44.400]   them, sometimes they have really expensive palates. Like we went out to dinner with my parents once and
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.960]   my dad loves sashimi. We all do. And he orders this sashimi plate. My daughter's like just grabbing
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:54.420]   it by the piece, eating it like popcorn. And we're like, man, you are an expensive, uh, dinner companion.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:59.780]   This episode is brought to you by superhuman. Now I've used superhuman for years, and I think it's
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:05.680]   hands down the best way to do email, assuming you value your time, which I absolutely assume you do.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.540]   That's because superhuman is the ultimate solution for inbox decluttering and enhanced productivity.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.620]   It's also the fastest email experience out there. And I'm certain I've saved dozens,
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:20.060]   if not hundreds of hours a year using superhuman. They have every feature you could ever want built
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:25.660]   in split inboxes for prioritizing what matters, keyboard shortcuts and snippets for everything,
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:31.360]   AI tools to draft responses and summarize emails, automated reminders and integrated calendars.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.820]   And if you're using superhuman for teams, you get shared conversations and drafts that will help
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:42.680]   you respond faster and reduce deal cycles. Best of all, superhuman works with your existing Gmail

[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:30.180]   for dinner all the time. But today I want to talk about their dream knit collection because it's amazing.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:36.020]   It is super soft, lightweight, moisture wicking, but also has this amazing four-way performance
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:40.900]   stretch that makes it so comfortable. While it's almost impossible to narrow my Viore recommendations
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.700]   down to just one thing, I want you to check out the Ponto Performance Jogger for men or the Performance

[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:30.600]   probiotics. I feel like it is a topic I know absolutely nothing about, but I know there are,
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.200]   you know, friends and family members who are like, Oh, are you taking your prebiotics and probiotics
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:39.880]   every day? Like, this is what I take. Where, how do you, clearly the gut is probably the target
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:45.160]   of why they're taking those things. Yeah. How does that fit in, in your kind of framework?
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.080]   Well, the first thing I want to tell people is that prebiotics are food.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:54.280]   That's what you should think. A prebiotic is not a pill or a supplement. The World Health
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:02.600]   Organization definition, a probiotic is a live organism that when ingested confers a benefit
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:08.440]   to the host. So that knocks out 99% of the things people are taking because they're conferring no benefit
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:16.120]   to them. They're, they're taking some pill from the supermarket or the pharmacy and it's supposed to
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:21.000]   have this amount of live bacteria. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. And they're just pooing it out,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.880]   mostly dead bacteria, not present in sufficient quantities to colonize the gut and reproduce and
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:34.280]   make a difference and not clear that these species are necessary or doing anything. So the most important
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:40.840]   part for people to know is that you need to be trying to colonize in, in terms of encouraging
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:47.640]   reproduction of your existing bacteria because half the stuff you're taking in a pill is dead or not
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:52.360]   helpful. There are some probiotics out there on the market, one in particular that I use in my patients
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.960]   because it's been studied in over a hundred human trials. And it's a combination of seven or eight
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:03.320]   different strains of bacteria that have been very well studied for serious conditions like ulcerative
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:09.400]   colitis, as well as irritable bowel syndrome and found to have efficacy. But that is the kind that
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:15.080]   is refrigerated. It is sent to you with a little monitor to show that it maintained this temperature.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:20.760]   If the temperature went above this amount, there's not enough viable organisms and they'll, they'll replace
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:26.360]   it. That's not the typical over the counter that people are just going to the health food store and
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:32.680]   buying. And even for that one, as sort of fancy and spectacular as it is, I use that primarily in
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:37.240]   my patients with gut disorders. I don't recommend that the average person take that like vitamins.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.680]   We don't have any evidence that the average person benefits from taking a multivitamin.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.800]   Now, if you have Crohn's disease and you'll be 12 deficient, sure. Or if you have vitamin D deficiency,
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.680]   or if you're iron deficient, but just then you take iron, but just taking a multivitamin,
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:58.360]   then we don't have evidence that it's doing anything. So a much more meaningful and impactful
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.840]   approach is to think about the gut bacteria in your gut already. You've got trillions of them.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:08.120]   And what can you do to feed them and to amplify them and to feed the right species? And this is where
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:13.160]   you get into, okay, we want to feed them more fiber. We want to cut down on the alcohol and the processed
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.360]   food. We want to make sure we're hydrating so that our gut is moving. Our gut motility is normal,
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.960]   because when the gut is stagnant, that also creates problems with the gut bacteria.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:30.120]   It is not as sexy, perhaps, as taking a pill, but is much more impactful for your gut. So that's a
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:37.720]   probiotic. Prebiotics refer to the food that bacteria eat. The food, not the pill or the powder or the
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:46.120]   potion, the food, the actual fiber. So things like legumes and greens and, you know, berries and all those foods
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:51.400]   that contain fiber. But particularly when we think about things like, um, foods that are high in
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:56.120]   inulin. So it could be things like dandelion greens and oats and so on. And the fibrous part of the
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:01.080]   vegetable. So if you think about like the broccoli stock, that's where most of the fiber is. It's not
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:08.680]   in the floret or vegetables like celery. So think of those dense, fibrous foods. Those are prebiotics.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:15.080]   You're feeding your gut bacteria. We don't have evidence that a prebiotic pill or powder is doing
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:20.120]   anything. And that's why I always tell people, as Maya Angelou famously said, when somebody tells you who
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:25.960]   they are, believe them. When you see the label at the bottom saying this compound has not been shown
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:32.440]   to treat or cure or fix anything that's wrong with you, believe it. They are telling you this is not
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.400]   doing anything and people are still buying it. I don't get it.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:42.280]   You mentioned hydration. How much water do we need in a day for healthy guts?
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:48.200]   There's pretty significant variation based on your activity level, how much water you're getting from
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:53.880]   the food you're eating, etc. But a good rule of thumb, Chris, is half your body weight in ounces
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:44:00.280]   of water. So if you weigh 150 pounds, 75 ounces. If you weigh 200 pounds, 100 ounces as a baseline of just
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:06.360]   water. Not water with salt or minerals or anything in it. Just basic water. That's a really good rule
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:14.440]   of thumb. You said plants are good. What about animal products like meats and dairy, cheeses, milk? Any of
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:22.600]   those good, bad for your gut or moderation? From a GI point of view, there's room for a little animal
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:28.680]   protein on the plate. I've treated thousands of patients over more than three decades. And I will
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:33.720]   tell you, even my patients who have severe complex autoimmune disorders where their gut is super
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.840]   inflamed, they can manage some animal protein. So there are lots of reasons to not eat animals for
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:45.960]   the environment, etc., etc. But to say that the ideal diet from a gut point of view completely excludes
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:52.280]   animal protein, I don't think that's certainly not correct in my experience. That being said,
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:57.080]   I will tell you that for a lot of my patients with severe inflammation in their gut, increasing the
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:02.040]   amount of plants they're eating is incredible. So usually what I'll say to people is, if you want
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.360]   to eat some animal protein, have one animal protein meal a day. It could be breakfast, lunch or dinner,
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.000]   where the meal is built around animal protein. And then for the rest, try and build it more around
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.560]   plants, including foods that are high in plant protein, like legumes, etc. But to not have every
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:23.480]   meal be so animal protein centric, because then you tend to crowd out the plants. So I think that's a
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:27.480]   pretty reasonable way to do it. And you know, Chris, we talked about feedback, your body gives
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:32.520]   you that feedback. Because most people who go on like a serious high protein keto type diet,
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:39.480]   what's the first thing that happens? They get constipated, right? We saw sales of psyllium husk
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:45.880]   that most people would know as Metamucil soar with the advent of the South Beach diet and the Atkins diet,
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:52.680]   etc. Because everybody was so constipated. Animal protein is fine, depending on your requirements for based
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.240]   on what you're doing and your daily activities, you can you can tolerate and you can probably tolerate
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:03.240]   more than the one meal a day. But once you start to get constipated, that's generally a sign that you know
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:07.560]   that you need to cut back on the animal protein and add in some more plant, more plant fiber.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:12.600]   Are there any other kind of sneaky things that play a negative or positive role? I know,
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:18.360]   I think I've seen you talk a little about artificial sweetener. And how does that fit in? And are there
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.840]   any other similar things that it's that can have a really big impact? Artificial sweeteners are really
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.560]   problematic. And the worrisome thing is they've kind of snuck into everything, right? So people advertise
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:33.480]   like low sugar. And you think, okay, this has less sugar. But what they mean is, it's got artificial
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:41.240]   sweetener in it. And we know definitively that these non-nutritive sweeteners, as we call them, the sucrose,
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:47.400]   the maltose, all the different oses, which are poorly absorbed sugars, that they really wreak havoc
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.840]   on the gut. The reason they don't contribute calories is because they're not absorbed in the
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:56.440]   small intestine. So they float on down to the colon, where they get fermented by gut bacteria, but they get
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:03.320]   fermented into harmful post-metabolic products, not healthy things like short-chain fatty acids.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.640]   And some of that too, they'll give you gas. If you've ever had like diabetic candy with a lot
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:12.440]   of artificial sweetener, one of the first things you'll see is like, oh, I'm having terrible bloating
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:17.720]   and gas. And that's the products of fermentation. The other thing I want to tell people, particularly
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:23.240]   people who might be struggling with their weight and thinking, I'll have a low calorie sweetener since
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:29.720]   I don't want to have the calories, is that insulin, the hormone that will sort of signal your body that
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:35.720]   things should be stored as fat. Insulin is released in response to sweetness, not in response to
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:42.120]   calories. So even if something says zero calories or 10 calories, and you burn it in a calorometer,
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:47.480]   and it's low-cal, when you ingest that substance, and if you've ever had something sweetened with an
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:53.080]   artificial sweetener, you know artificial sweeteners are typically very sweet, usually sweeter than regular
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:48:00.760]   sugar. So you ingest that, you get the same or more insulin release, which is why diet sodas
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:07.880]   are just as big a likelihood of you gaining weight as regular soda, and sometimes more,
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.040]   because sometimes the insulin releases more. So it's pretty misleading for consumers. They say,
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:17.240]   oh, zero calories. And that may be true, but not zero weight gain. You're still getting the weight
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:23.240]   gain because you're getting the insulin release. And so I really try and stare people away from any sort
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:29.960]   of diet, anything, non-nutritive sweeteners, because of that, but also because they're really tough on the
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:35.000]   gut and particularly disruptive to the gut microbiome. So one way to get around that is to,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.280]   I always say have the regular sugar, but just have less of it. If you usually put a tablespoon of sugar
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:46.600]   in your coffee, try a teaspoon or half a teaspoon. So just gradually train your palate to have a little
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:52.760]   less of the sweetener. In terms of dairy, part of the problem with the dairy is that the dairy industry
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:57.960]   in this country is full of antibiotics. Typically, the dairy cows are being given antibiotics
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:05.320]   prophylactically to prevent other infections, etc. And it becomes then sort of a highly processed
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:10.600]   product at the end. That's often the animals have been exposed to antibiotics. But if we look at
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:15.880]   something like cheeses, like a good quality cheese, cheese is a fermented product. And if you're in
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:20.760]   France and where you can eat a different cheese every day of the week and never have the same cheese twice,
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:26.440]   and you can get like a really great, you know, locally made cheese, have some cheese.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:31.800]   And if you're not terribly lactose intolerant, and you really like cheese, it's okay to have a little
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:37.320]   cheese, have a good quality, like a hard Parmesan, like a Parmigiano Reggio or something like that.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.160]   Don't have a processed cheese.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.240]   And is milk in the same bucket?
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.320]   For most people who are lactose intolerant can tolerate a little hard cheese, but they're not
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:51.880]   going to tolerate milk. And there's not much reason for an adult to drink milk. Because, again, milk is
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:58.920]   what allows a little small calf to grow into a big, huge dairy cow really quickly. So, I mean, if you're
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:05.880]   trying to put weight on quickly, you know, milk has a lot of sugar in it, etc. That could be something
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:11.880]   reasonable. But milk is a health food, not so much. It's very calorie dense, has a lot of sugar in it,
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:19.080]   and isn't really contributing much in terms of calcium and so on. What we find is that eating
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:24.600]   green leafy vegetables and small bone fish like salmon and sardine is more useful than having dairy
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.880]   for growing strong bones.

[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:25.320]   I have one more topic that I was surprised didn't come up earlier. When we were talking about
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.720]   the symptoms, you know, you went through the symptoms of reflux, the symptoms of bloating.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:34.760]   We're pretty far in this conversation. We haven't talked a lot about poop. It's not not a common topic
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:39.480]   on the show, but you mentioned a couple of times like, oh, you want to make sure you have healthy
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:46.840]   poop. I don't think most people know what that is. So maybe we can do a quick rapid round and run through
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.480]   what people should be knowing and thinking and doing about their poop.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:56.520]   Fantastic. Before we do that, I asked Mel Robbins this when I was on her podcast last year.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.760]   I asked Dan Harris this when I was on his podcast a few weeks ago. And I'm going to ask you,
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:05.080]   tell us about your bowel movements, Chris. I'll tell you, Dan got super uncomfortable.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:10.200]   He turned bright red. But I think you can tell us. Are you like an everyday kind of guy? Morning?
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:16.120]   I am not as consistent in that. Like, I don't have a time where it's like, oh, it's like an hour after
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:21.480]   breakfast. That's the time. But I would say definitely feels like an everyday kind of thing,
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:26.360]   but not a three times a day kind of thing. It wouldn't feel alarming to me if a day went by
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:30.520]   without a bowel movement. Like, I wouldn't be like, oh my gosh, what's wrong? But mostly because
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.760]   I think it's, it's not so regimented in time that I don't even know if I would notice.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:37.480]   And is there some ease associated with it?
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.840]   It's a much quicker thing. Like I know some people love to just go and, you know,
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.840]   sit and play around and, you know, check the news and read a book. I'm like in, out.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:51.800]   So you have just described stool nirvana. So we eat every day. We should be pooing every day,
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.200]   but you can miss a day here and there. If you're a five times a week or a six times a week,
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.160]   that's perfectly fine. If you're a twice a day or even a three times a day, that's fine too.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:06.520]   If the consistency is pretty good. One of the things you said is really key,
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:11.320]   which is your in and out. The worst thing is to take your phone in or a magazine or something,
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:16.040]   because you're training your bowels. Your bowels actually have nerve cells. We talk about the second
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:20.600]   brain in the gut, the enteric nervous system. And our, our gut has about seven times as many
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.240]   nerve cells as our spinal cord, not as much as our central nervous system. So it's a very well
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:29.800]   innervated organ and it's very sensitive to training. Think of potty training with kids,
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:35.960]   right? And so if you go in there with your phone or a book every time, what you're training your gut
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:40.840]   to do is to take your time. You're saying, oh yeah, we got all day. We're reading the news feed,
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.600]   take your time. So you never want to go in there with anything. You want to get in there,
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:49.080]   you want to get on the john, you want to try and push something out, or ideally you have the urge.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:54.120]   You can give that a couple of tries. If nothing happens, you want to leave and then come back.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:54:00.120]   And in terms of what the stool should look like, one of my favorite podcast episodes was mama jama
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:05.880]   poos. It is, if you want to know how to have a mama jama poo, this is an episode to listen to,
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:13.320]   including size. You want the stool to be about the size of a banana, ideally. Now it might not all be in
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:18.040]   one piece. It could be like, okay, here's three parts and you put it all together and it's about the size
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:24.360]   of a banana. And the reason that's important is not just because of elimination and how important
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:29.320]   that is for our body to detoxify and eliminate. It's because there's a really strong correlation
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:36.680]   between size of stool and colon cancer risk. And colon cancer is now the second leading cause of cancer
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:43.400]   deaths in women under 50 and the number one in men, in men under 50 and it's prostate higher
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:48.440]   up. So we're seeing this, you know, alarming increase in colon cancer in young people. And
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:54.520]   it's probably due to lots of stuff. I'm sure the food is contributing, but having a large bowel
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:55:01.160]   movement about the size of a banana is really protective against colon cancer because it means
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:05.320]   that you have sufficient fiber in your diet that you're having this really good elimination. And you
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:10.600]   want it to be a good chocolatey color, like not necessarily a dark chocolate, and you want it to have some
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:16.840]   form. It's okay if it breaks apart, but you don't want it, when it falls into the bowl, it should retain
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:22.600]   its form. It shouldn't then fall apart. And you know, a little on the soft side is good. It's totally normal to
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:28.120]   see a little flex of fibrous foods. Like if you're, you know, had a big kale salad the night before and
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:32.920]   you see a little bit of green, that's totally normal. If you are having diarrhea and you're
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:39.000]   seeing undigested food, like rice grains and stuff, that's a problem. That means that maybe you're not
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.160]   digesting the food properly. Maybe you're not absorbing it properly, or maybe the transit time
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:48.600]   is too fast. It could be any one of those things, but it's okay to see some vegetable matter, particularly
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:55.320]   if you're a, if you're a good fiber eater and position is really important. So the ideal position
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:01.000]   for having the stool shoot out, if you're bendy, you could actually sit back on the toilet and then put
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.360]   your feet up on the front of the toilet bowl. Because when you do that, you're adjusting the angle of the
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:12.440]   puborectalis muscle and you open up the angle and it really allows the stool to release. It's also the
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.600]   much better position for childbearing too. We're supposed to be squatting. We're not supposed to,
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:21.160]   you know, be lying on our backs, but that that's for another episode. And so when we look at countries,
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:25.720]   like countries, again, that are less developed, like parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia,
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:32.280]   where people still squat a lot over, you know, when, when I was in Turkey two years ago and a lot of the
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:39.320]   bathrooms in Istanbul, you had this sort of Western stall, but then you also had the option of a stall with
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:46.120]   a hole and you could squat over it. And trust me, there is an art to that, but squatting like that
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.440]   is much more efficient for getting the stool out.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:53.720]   Any other tips. If people are like, I'm not, I'm not at Nirvana yet. Um, you know, you said fiber,
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:58.520]   you said hydration. Yeah. Well, the hydration one, I mean, you obviously want to be hydrated all
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:03.080]   through the day, but this one is really important. My husband and I have been married almost 25 years.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:08.360]   And the other day I did this and I said to him, I was like, you know, when you drink this chug a whole
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:12.440]   bunch of water in the morning before you go, it really helps the stool could come out. And he got pissed.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:17.400]   He was like, we've been married almost 25 years and you're just telling me that now, but keep a bottle
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:21.960]   of water by your bed. That's like 20 ounces and chug it in the morning, right. When you get up before
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:29.720]   your feet hit the ground, what that does is it triggers something called the gastrocolic reflex.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:36.200]   And the gastro meaning stomach colic, meaning colon reflex is a reflex where the first thing that's in
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:41.800]   your stomach in the morning, it sends a chemical signal to the bottom of your digestive tract,
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:47.000]   your colon saying, okay, food is coming in time to empty out and the colon starts to contract.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.040]   And that helps to give you that signal. So a lot of people find with coffee, right? And they think
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:57.560]   coffee helps them go and it does. But for a lot of people, it's just because coffee is the first thing
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:03.480]   that they're having. If they were having, you know, some water or something, the reason I recommend
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:08.440]   the large volume is that that will really distend your stomach. And that really helps to trigger the
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:12.760]   gastrocolic reflex. A sip of coffee or tea may not do it. And you don't obviously don't want
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:18.760]   to chug 20 ounces of coffee in the morning. I don't recommend that. But if you really fill your
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:25.000]   stomach with water, 20 ounces where you're like, ooh, my stomach is quite full now, you're much more
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.080]   likely to trigger that gastrocolic reflex. So if you're somebody who tends to be a bit sluggish in
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.320]   the morning with the bowel movements, and you're like, oh, I think I have to go, but I'm not sure I
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:40.440]   have to go, try that chugging, and then go. And you will see it will likely trigger that gastrocolic
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:45.080]   reflex. So the combination for stool nirvana in the morning would be, of course, the night before,
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:50.360]   you've had a lot of fiber that day. And then in the morning, you chug your 20 ounces of water,
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.040]   and then you get in there and you put your feet up, that can make a huge difference.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:59.160]   And you said the night before, is that the general timeframe? Is it like 12 hours from eating?
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:05.800]   Really the day before, the transit time can be anywhere from 12 to 48 hours. So I should have said
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:10.720]   earlier would be better. So if you have like a huge fibrous lunch, that would be great. And a lighter
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:16.640]   dinner. For a lot of people who are experiencing bloating or constipation or just abdominal discomfort,
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:21.480]   calorie shifting where you're having a bigger breakfast and lunch and a lighter dinner will really help
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:27.400]   because the digestive tract functions in concert with a light dark cycle, the circadian rhythm. So
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:32.760]   once the sun sets, your GI tract really slows down. And so if you're having your biggest meal
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:37.720]   at dinnertime, you're likely to be uncomfortable, that food isn't really getting digested, maybe it's
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:42.360]   triggering some reflux. So ideally, your big fiber load should be a bit earlier in the day at breakfast
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:42.840]   and lunch.
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:49.480]   Okay, we talked about bloating. But what about gas either from either side? How does that fit in?
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:56.440]   I really like to think about gas as good gas versus bad gas. Good gas is, I had lentils and Brussels
[00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:04.960]   sprouts for dinner. And you know, now I have gas. And that is because those foods have a lot of poorly
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:09.580]   digestible fiber. And we don't have the enzymes. So for example, if you look at something like beans,
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:14.820]   there is an enzyme alpha-1 galactosidase. We don't make it. And that's because the beans,
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:19.220]   the fiber in the beans is really there to feed our gut bacteria. The idea is that, you know,
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:25.800]   we absorb what we can. The gut bacteria ferment the fiber, the poorly digestible or indigestible fiber,
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:31.140]   and then they make all these important things, the short-chain fatty acids, etc. So you're going to get
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:37.120]   some gas with that. That's different from the gas you get from, oh, I ate a bunch of sugar-free candy,
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:43.180]   and now I like have pain and feel terrible. Or I'm severely lactose intolerant. And that gas is
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:50.480]   usually accompanied by like queasiness and, you know, you just, you don't feel good. So there's a
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:55.660]   distinction there. And when people will say to me, well, you know, I love beans and I know they're good
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:01:00.460]   for me. When I eat them, I have gas. I usually recommend, well, eat a little bit less. Eat them
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:04.800]   earlier in the day. Make sure you're soaking them before you cook them. You can cook them with a sea
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:10.700]   vegetable like kombu. Those are all things that can help. But I would never recommend somebody
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:15.980]   completely stop eating beans because they have gas because you're supposed to have some gas with beans.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.160]   And is gas actually a problem or is it more like a cultural problem?
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:24.560]   It's more of a cultural problem, although it can be painful, Chris. A lot of the gas that I see is
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.280]   because people are constipated. So they're not overproducing gas in their GI tract. They're just
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.980]   plugged down below. And that can happen even if somebody's having a bowel movement every day.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:39.460]   They can still be constipated because what they're having is incomplete evacuation. They're going,
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:43.780]   but it's just a little small stool and they've still got a plug of stool there in the rectum.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:49.680]   And the gas that would normally just be dissipating out where you wouldn't even feel it is now all
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:55.160]   plugged up in there and now they're uncomfortable. So gas is rarely a problem. I mean, I don't think in
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:02:01.260]   my 30 plus years I've ever had a medical emergency of gas. Although if somebody has a narrowing in
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.620]   their intestine, a stricture, we can see that after surgery. We can see it in people who have
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:10.800]   Crohn's disease. Somebody has colon cancer. You can have a buildup of gas that can be quite an urgent
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:17.520]   situation. But the average person, there's no gas emergency. And one of the rules of thumb is if you
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.460]   can let it out, you should. You don't want to hold it in like that. That's really not good for your GI
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:29.280]   track. So excuse yourself, go to the bathroom, try and let it rip. That's definitely good. And if you're
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:36.200]   having a lot of gas, even just all the time, not with beans or kale or things like that, think about
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:42.320]   whether your bowel movements could need a little enhancement. Because if you're not emptying fully,
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:48.200]   you may be experiencing more gas just because of that plug at the bottom that's not allowing things to
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:54.120]   release. And if that's not the case, is this where aerophasia, if I'm getting it right, could play a
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.920]   role here? Or for someone who's like, no, bowels are great, feel like I'm emptying lots of gas, what could
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:06.560]   that be? Absolutely. I'm so glad you mentioned that. Aerophasia refers to air swallowing, aero, air, and
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:12.660]   phasia swallowing. And it is a very underdiagnosed but common problem. And most people who are swallowing
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:18.780]   air are doing it inadvertently. What causes people to have aerophasia? If you have a deviated septum. Say
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:24.020]   your nose was broken and it didn't, you know, it didn't heal properly. If you have a deviated septum, you
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:29.320]   tend to be a mouth breather. Or if you have allergies. So if you have a little bit of hay fever allergies, you'll
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.640]   tend to be more of a mouth breather than a nose breather. If you're a mouth breather, you're more likely to swallow
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:41.880]   air. If you are talking fast, you're more likely to swallow air. If you are drinking and talking, if you are sucking on
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:48.800]   hard candy and chewing gum, carbonated drinks, seltzer, champagne, beer, things like that, it's normal to
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:54.960]   swallow a little bit of air. But if you are experiencing the triad of frequent burping, abdominal
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:02.460]   distension, where you're really uncomfortable, and pain like that, then you may actually have
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:08.860]   aerophasia. And there's some really effective techniques. Usually it's a speech pathologist who
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:13.180]   take care of it. Once we've done our evaluation as gastroenterologists and made sure, you know,
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:18.020]   it's not an ulcer or heartburn or anything like that. They'll usually evaluate people's speech and
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:22.540]   swallowing. And they're able to determine that they're air swallowing and sort of give them some
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:28.900]   training and redirect them to do whatever it is they're doing differently.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:35.100]   I think both of my kids would say like, there's no cultural problem with passing gas anywhere around
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:41.040]   the house. And they are right. It's not beans. It's not it's not aerophasia. It's just that's just
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:47.300]   normal, I guess. Absolutely. There is a and kids are generally much less shy about it. Right. So you're
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.120]   going to notice it more because you're like quietly excusing yourself. And they're just letting it rip
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:56.220]   right there, which I love. So good. And kids, kids find it so funny. Do you kids find it funny?
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:01.520]   They find it hysterical. But I and I think we probably do, too. So we probably compound that
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:07.120]   effect. But I always wonder, like, is there an amount that is concerning? And it sounds like if
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:13.800]   everything else is normal. No, no. Correct. And, you know, it can be a sign of a food intolerance like
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.940]   lactose intolerance, fructose intolerance, etc. But those things usually have other symptoms like they're
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:24.900]   having diarrhea or they're nauseated. So if it's just gas and everything else is fine, generally not
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:29.960]   something I would worry about. Just to keep going down this rabbit hole, like is does the smell of
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:38.760]   that gas mean anything related to your gut? It can. But that alone is not a problem. And,
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:44.560]   you know, I always tell people really look for the change in, for example, the change in your bowel
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.140]   movement could be that you've been colonized with some bacteria. If you traveled overseas or something,
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:53.580]   you may not have a serious infection, but your gut could have been colonized with something or
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:59.240]   you've eaten some food that hasn't agreed with you, something like that. In the absence of other
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.480]   symptoms, blood in your stool, pain, a change in the consistency of the stool or the frequency,
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:11.360]   generally not an emergency. But if it persists over time, something to think about getting checked out.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:18.180]   Okay, super helpful. I'm sure that there are some doctors out there or medical professionals that
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:24.680]   might kind of have a dissenting opinion on gut health. What kind of evidence would you point to
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.540]   someone or what would be your reaction if you were in a debate with someone that's like this isn't as
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:35.780]   important as you're saying it is? Again, I would have them look down at their belly and say, okay,
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:43.080]   look where that is located. That is feeding everything. There is no brain health, no immune
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:49.100]   health, no lung health without gut health. Because think about it, Chris, even if you are eating a
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:56.500]   fantastic, super nutritious diet, if your gut is not able to digest the food and assimilate the food
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:02.360]   through the lining, let's say the enzymatic activity is off or the microbiome is off because the microbes are
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:07.680]   involved in breaking down the food also, or the gut lining is compromised, you are not going to be
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:13.180]   able to absorb and assimilate those nutrients properly. And we see that all the time. So of
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:18.480]   course, the goal is to eat the most nutritious, the healthiest diet you can, but you also have to make
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:24.160]   sure that you're also cultivating the healthiest gut you can so that those nutrients can be properly
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:31.320]   absorbed and appreciated by your body. It is really the engine for the entire body. It is not just a
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:39.660]   digestive organ. It is a defensive organ. It traps toxins in that gut lumen and expels them. It decides
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:44.560]   what nutrients get absorbed in through the gut lining to travel through the bloodstream to the other
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:51.640]   organs. It unravels viral protein to keep us safe. What about mucus? It produces mucus. Most people think
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:58.600]   about the lungs with mucus, but the gut is a main producer of mucus and mucus traps viruses and pathogens
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:06.440]   and then expels them either down below or you spit it up. So like now with pollen season in DC, I have
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:11.120]   all this mucus and I have to remind myself, don't take an antihistamine or something that's going to
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:17.080]   decrease your mucus production because the mucus is being produced to trap the pollen to get it out of
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:23.920]   your body. Okay. I feel like we covered so much. What's the one takeaway or next step you want someone who's
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:31.900]   thinking about this to do with regard to their own? I want people to look at their GI tract as a sort of
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:39.300]   living laboratory in their body and to start figuring it out like, hmm, what would happen if I drank 100
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:45.140]   ounces of water a day instead of only the 17 ounces I'm getting? I want to try that for a week. What would
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:53.420]   happen if I massively increase my fiber consumption by committing to a huge salad every day or my one,
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:58.740]   two, three rule, one veggie at breakfast, two at lunch, three at dinner? What would happen if I had
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:05.200]   a big lunch and a light dinner or maybe no dinner? Get playful about it because your gut will give you
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:11.360]   that feedback with whether it's taking away something that you're doing that you think, oh, maybe I shouldn't
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.860]   be doing this or adding in something that you're not doing. Like literally an apple a day, it actually
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:23.620]   does make a difference. So I want people to think of their gut as this laboratory, if you will, that is
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:27.980]   going to give you this positive and negative feedback. And then I want you to pay attention to it. So when
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:32.340]   you do all these things and then you have stool nirvana, then don't stop, right? Don't be like, oh,
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:36.720]   okay, that was good. When you see that bowel movement come out, I mean, it's telling you so much.
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:43.000]   So I want people to turn around and take a look, as I say, after they have a bowel movement. You know,
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.840]   you could see something really important. Like you could see blood in the stool that could be a sign
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:50.980]   that there's something serious going on. I mean, maybe it's just a hemorrhoid, but maybe it's an
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:56.320]   early sign of colon cancer. You could see a very narrow stool coming out that could be a sign that
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.340]   you're developing something like diverticulosis. So there's so much that your gut can tell you.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.780]   Just paying attention to these things and not thinking of this stuff as like, oh, that's gross.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:09.240]   And, you know, we shouldn't talk about that. That's just something you do in private. And then
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.500]   you never think about again. Absolutely not. This is some of the most important feedback that your
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:19.820]   body's giving you. And we need to like really pay attention to it and talk about it and examine it
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:27.020]   and follow the crumbs to a healthier gut. Having a really great bowel movement is the ultimate form
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:31.800]   of detoxification. And for anyone who wants to go even deeper on this, you've mentioned a few
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.260]   of your books. We'll link to them in the show notes. You mentioned one episode. We'll put that
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:40.180]   there. But where can people just find everything you're working on? Gutbliss.com is a place to find
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:47.760]   me. One word, G-U-T-B-L-I-S-S and the Gutbliss podcast. I have a weekly podcast. Episodes are nice
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.680]   and short and digestible. New episodes drop every Thursday and we get into it. Mama Jama poos,
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:59.800]   air swallowing, turn around and take a look. How did I forget? You can join the Gutbliss Gut Club.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:08.020]   So twice a month, you can join me. It's a one hour monthly Q&A. Ask me anything about gut health.
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:13.160]   Literally no question is too big or small. And then one hour masterclass every month. I'll often have
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:19.300]   guest experts with me, but we'll dive deep into a topic, whether it is side effects of GLP-1 drugs,
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:26.420]   the link between brain diseases like Parkinson's and gut health, stool microbiome testing. And the
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:30.500]   cool thing with the Gut Club is that people get to vote on the topic. So I love having these
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:35.860]   conversations. The podcast is great, but it feels like a conversation with myself because I'm not
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:42.860]   getting to talk to people. So join the Gutbliss Gut Club for riveting conversation twice a month.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.100]   Awesome. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.940]   Oh, thank you for having me.
