[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.440]   Welcome, everyone, to the 31st episode
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.480]   of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.240]   Today, our special guest is Jamie Catherwood,
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.160]   a bona fide financial history nerd.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.280]   Jamie's research that he publishes weekly
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.120]   on his Investor Amnesia website show
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.400]   that we make the same mistakes as investors
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.920]   over and over again.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.440]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.360]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.320]   of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.520]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.440]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.040]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.240]   Donations can be made at boglecenter.net.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.600]   Today, we have a special guest, Jamie Catherwood.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.760]   I first met Jamie at a quantitative analyst meeting
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.760]   that was full of PhDs and people a lot smarter than me.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.320]   And there was this young man captivating all these PhDs,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.600]   just coming up with all of this information
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.440]   that I'd never heard of.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.360]   And as I listened to him talk, I came quickly to the conclusion
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.840]   that he was one of the smartest people in the room.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.300]   And I actually got a little bit nervous when somebody said
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.760]   my name, and he looked at me and said, you're Rick Ferry?
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.960]   That scared me a little bit.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.520]   I said to myself, how am I going to keep up with this guy?
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.040]   But it turned out great.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.100]   It was a real pleasure getting to know Jamie,
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.720]   and it's a real pleasure having him on the show today.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.040]   I'm sure you're going to enjoy this.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.320]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Jamie Catherwood.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.640]   Welcome to the podcast, Jamie.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.960]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.560]   It's an honor to be here.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.960]   I wanted to have you on the show to dig into all of the work
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.480]   that you've done, even though you don't have your PhD.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.800]   I mean, you have done a PhD volume worth of work
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.640]   on financial history, and have developed a website called
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.840]   Investor Amnesia, and a course, and really have become quite
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.720]   a widely known expert on financial history
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.320]   at the young age of 26 years old.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.960]   So before I jump into our discussion
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.580]   about financial history, could you
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.280]   tell us a little bit about your background
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.400]   and what got you to this point?
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.560]   It actually kind of goes all the way down the line
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.160]   in my ancestry, particularly on my father's side.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.920]   I don't know how many greats it is, but great, great, great
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.000]   something grandfather was a guy named Frederick Catherwood.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.400]   And he is known for helping rediscover the Mayan civilization
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.320]   with his colleague John Lloyd Stevens.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.400]   And this is in the mid to late 19th century.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.320]   They went through the jungles of, I think,
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.000]   modern day Guatemala, and found these ancient ruins
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.040]   that they had heard about.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.920]   And what my ancestor did, his role
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.880]   was painting these really elaborate lithographs.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.720]   And if you just Google Frederick Catherwood,
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.160]   you'll see some of these beautiful illustrations.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.440]   And it was those illustrations that were actually
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.840]   used to help decipher the Mayan language,
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.960]   and figure out what these monuments and statues were
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.240]   talking about and representing.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.600]   And we could decipher the history
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   of the Mayan civilization.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.320]   Edgar Allan Poe said the book that Frederick Catherwood
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.480]   and his colleague John Lloyd Stevens
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.880]   put out about their adventures was the most important book
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.080]   on travel written in the 19th century.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.760]   And then there's actually another Frederick Catherwood
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.080]   who is my direct grandfather, much more recent.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.000]   He sadly passed away in 2014.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.040]   But he has also always been an avid historian
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.840]   and passionate history buff.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.760]   And he had a fascinating career in both business and politics,
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.520]   to the point where he was actually knighted formally
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.000]   by the queen in 1971, I believe.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960]   And so he is technically Sir Frederick Catherwood.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.360]   Does that roll down generations?
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.680]   Are you a Sir also?
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.360]   I wish.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.920]   I wish.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.240]   If it did, I would have a full suit of armor in my apartment.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.640]   I would definitely be showing that off all the time.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.280]   But no, it does not, unfortunately, roll down.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.520]   He, from there, went on to be a founding
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.400]   member of the European Parliament and European Union.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.440]   And he was elected at first in 1974
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.600]   to be a representative from Cambridgeshire.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   And from there, he kept serving for decades
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.200]   and eventually ended up being the vice president
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.960]   of the entire European Parliament in the late '90s
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.680]   into the early 2000s, before then retiring afterwards.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.600]   But he and the greater ancestor have definitely
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.800]   had an influence in my interest in history and business,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.200]   politics, et cetera.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.440]   Well, that's incredible pedigree,
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.840]   to actually do what you are now doing,
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.920]   history and economics and politics,
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.320]   tying those things together.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.560]   I mean, it's really your work.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.840]   Can you tell us about your work?
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.600]   My work stems more from immediate interest
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.240]   from college as a history major with my now
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.000]   professional interest as someone who
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.880]   works in the financial services industry at an asset
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.160]   manager, O'Shaughnessy Asset Management.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.640]   And I really wanted to marry my two interests.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.360]   And I began writing after the recommendation
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.400]   of a friend of mine to join Twitter
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.960]   as a way for networking.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.400]   And then after I joined Twitter, I
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.520]   saw that there were a bunch of people
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.920]   like yourself who were putting out
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.240]   great podcasts, blogs, et cetera.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.200]   And I missed the process of researching and writing
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.120]   that was basically my entire undergrad degree
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.560]   at King's College London doing history papers.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.040]   And so I figured maybe I'll put together
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.160]   a short series on interesting moments or characters
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.640]   in financial history.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.600]   And to my great surprise, they were very well received.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   And it turned out that there is a quite large base of people
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.520]   that were working in this industry that
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.640]   had an interest in history.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.040]   And so from there, it's gone from just posting
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.360]   some articles on Medium to developing my own website
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.840]   and starting a newsletter that now goes out to, I think,
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.480]   over 11,000 people each Sunday.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.760]   And in those posts, I'm taking together
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.440]   five different scholarly articles on financial history
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.280]   all wrapped around one theme that
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.920]   is relevant to whatever is going on in the markets that week.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.320]   So recently, I've had posts on the history of short selling
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.960]   and market corners, et cetera, after the whole GameStop
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.720]   mania.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.800]   I definitely feel that history is
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.720]   helpful for putting everything into context.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.800]   And you can avoid getting swept up
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.160]   by whatever the latest fad is.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.720]   And to my surprise, there are a lot of other people out there
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.960]   who share my nerddom for financial history.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.800]   Your newsletter that you send out every Sunday,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.240]   that's a lot of work.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.280]   Is there a cost to that if I wanted to sign up?
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.040]   How does that work?
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.600]   No, it's completely free.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.440]   If you just go to InvestorAmnesia.com,
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.400]   there is a section just right there
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.560]   on the home page for you to enter in your name and email.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.600]   And then you're good to go, and you'll
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.640]   start receiving that newsletter into your inbox every Sunday.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.480]   And the pictures that you come up with,
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.160]   and the charts, and the books that you photograph,
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   and the pamphlets, and everything
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.400]   from 100, 200 years ago, it's just amazing where
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.880]   you get this information from.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.320]   It's really a great resource for people
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.800]   who are interested in financial history, economic history,
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.680]   market history, and so forth.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.080]   One of the things that you make a point of in everything
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.520]   you do, including your course and your lectures
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.720]   that you're giving-- you've given lectures even at Yale
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.680]   University, correct?
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.680]   I mean, you've been out there quite a bit.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.320]   Is that what history is and isn't?
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.040]   So all of this work that you've done on financial histories,
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.840]   and manias, and booms, and busts,
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.960]   and tell us what history is, or what it is and what it isn't.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.360]   I mean, how does it help, and how does it not help?
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.160]   Yeah, so I guess to allude back to my more great ancestor who
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.440]   discovered the Mayan civilization by backpacking
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.560]   through the mountains, the analogy I like to use
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.920]   is history is a compass rather than a roadmap.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.080]   I think I do a good job of setting out
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.400]   what history is and isn't.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.200]   But I feel like some people might read either my site
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.480]   or just financial and economic history in general
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.800]   and think that, oh, I can see that something similar
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.200]   happened before, so now I know exactly what's
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.680]   going to happen in the future.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.040]   And so it's not a roadmap where there's previous laid out
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.960]   paths that you can just follow again,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.240]   and you'll end up at the same destination.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.160]   There's no clear route for you to take just
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.680]   by understanding history.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.600]   But what you can do with history is
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.120]   that there are some kind of high level and overarching themes
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.040]   that repeat themselves over and over throughout history, which
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.120]   is why I named my site Investor Amnesia because we never
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.440]   learn as investors.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.000]   Some of these same things continually
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   happen, especially related to investor behavior.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.880]   That's why there's always booms and busts and bubbles.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.200]   So history as a compass, I think,
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.720]   is a better analogy because, again, you
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.800]   won't know exactly how things are going
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.480]   to play out moving forward.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.880]   But by understanding and reading history,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.680]   you can see, OK, well, when these kind of forces
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.400]   have combined throughout centuries in the past,
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.280]   this has been the general direction
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.680]   that markets have gone moving forward.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.120]   And it just becomes easier to, at the very least,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.080]   orient yourself in the right direction
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.280]   and put things within a broader historical context
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.400]   and not get maybe swept up by short-term thinking
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.640]   and getting sidetracked in the latest fad or innovation that
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.200]   will supposedly revolutionize markets and change society
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.080]   forever.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.360]   Well, let's go ahead and start looking
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.480]   into some of your research.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.280]   And it covers many centuries.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.240]   We hear about tulip mania in Holland.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.680]   I mean, with your research, where does this all start?
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.440]   Yeah, so tulip mania is kind of my pet peeve
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.600]   because it's not actually what 90% of market commentators
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.480]   think it is.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.880]   There's a great book by Ann Goldgar,
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.400]   who was actually at my alma mater, King's College London,
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.680]   called Tulip Mania.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.560]   But it's not what market pundits think it is.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.960]   It's the result of some very shoddy historical sourcing
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.960]   by everyone's favorite author, Charles Mackay,
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.280]   in his Madness of Crowds book.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   Basically, the quick story is that he
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.520]   based all of his source work for the tulip mania
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:43.480]   section of his book on a German author from the 18th century.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.440]   And that German author got everything
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.200]   that he knew about tulip mania from these pamphlets that
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.320]   were highly sensationalized and just pure propaganda and false,
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.760]   in many cases, talking about people committing suicide
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.480]   after losing all of their money day trading tulips and families
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.680]   going broke and children starving because their dads
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.920]   were getting drunk in the tavern trading tulips.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.360]   And tulips were going for the cost of houses.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.120]   And one tulip was traded 100 times.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.200]   But what happened is that that guy, the German writer
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.080]   from the 18th century, wrote his book stating
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.880]   all those propaganda sources and satirical pamphlets as fact,
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.480]   as if they actually occurred.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.680]   And then that got passed into Charles Mackay's book.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.600]   And now we all use Charles Mackay's book
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.520]   as saying this is what happened to tulip mania.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.760]   But it's all based on satire and propaganda.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.880]   So there was a tulip--
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.400]   Stop, stop.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.800]   So are you telling me that it didn't happen?
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.680]   So there were people who were trading tulips.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.480]   But the narrative that, one, that it crashed the Dutch
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.720]   economy is just false.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:53.640]   It was a very small, siloed section of society.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.520]   So Anne Goldgarmi, she spent years in Dutch archives
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.520]   looking through all of these original sources,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.840]   original paper contracts that have carried on or lasted
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.320]   these few centuries.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.400]   And the most she ever found a tulip traded,
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.360]   like one single tulip, was five times.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.000]   But we always hear stories of the same tulip changing hands
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.280]   hundreds of times.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.480]   And the other thing is that the way that they worked,
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.800]   the contracts was I would agree to buy a tulip from you
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.720]   in the fall.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.960]   And then I would receive the tulip in the spring.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.400]   And so we would agree on a price.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.600]   But what happened was that a lot of those high prices,
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.400]   once spring came around, those contracts
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.840]   were never actually completed or executed.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.920]   And so there might have been high prices written somewhere.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.160]   But they weren't actually executed.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.440]   And so one, the prices weren't nearly as high
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.480]   as everyone says they are.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.120]   Because again, they're being taken
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.720]   from these satirical and propaganda sources.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.560]   But also, a lot of those higher prices
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.360]   weren't actually ever completed.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.800]   So no one actually ever paid those prices.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.360]   Tulip mania never really happened.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.240]   But it was sort of like a Hollywood movie, in a way.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.120]   So let's look at real actual history, real facts.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.760]   I mean, where does it begin?
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.200]   A little bit earlier in Holland, in 1602,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.640]   the founding of the East India Company and the stock
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.760]   market in Amsterdam, the first modern stock market,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.880]   was founded in 1609.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.520]   And the Amsterdam Stock Exchange is the first modern exchange.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.360]   And really, though, for the first good chunk
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.120]   of its existence, what's interesting to think about
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.560]   today is that really the only stock that was being traded
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.200]   was the East India Company.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.560]   So it's just bizarre to think about today
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   if the entire stock exchange was just Apple.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.040]   It was really just this one stock.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.880]   And then from there, you had the London Stock Exchange
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.920]   opened in the later 17th century at around the 1690s.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.880]   And that was the first tech IPO bubble.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   And then from there, you had exchanges pop up
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.920]   around Europe for the rest of the 18th and 19th centuries.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   But the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in the first decade
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.080]   of the 1600s is where it all begins.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.960]   The first big tech bubble occurred
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.880]   in London in the 1690s.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.440]   Can you talk about this tech bubble?
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.560]   So this is a really bizarre bubble
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.920]   in that it was prompted by a treasure hunt of all things.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.040]   Almost all of financial history, especially
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.320]   for the 17th and 18th and 19th centuries,
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.040]   basically follows a pattern of huge war,
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.080]   government has a lot of debt afterwards,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.600]   lowers rates, and then speculation abounds.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.320]   And so this was kind of the first major example of that,
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.440]   where after the Nine Years' War, Britain had all of this debt,
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.560]   and they lowered rates massively and tried to refinance the debt.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.440]   So during the 1690s, there was money to invest,
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.600]   but people did not want to put it into government assets
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.240]   because the rates were low.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.960]   Then what happened was Sir William Phipps,
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.520]   he went on a treasure hunt because he
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.120]   had heard that there were rumors of a sunken Spanish treasure
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.760]   ship off the coast of, I think it's Honduras,
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.520]   modern-day Honduras.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.680]   And it was essentially the ship that
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.840]   was going back to Spain to bring all this gold back,
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.040]   and then it sunk.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.480]   And so he went to London and got some--
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.000]   I called them in the article I wrote,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.880]   kind of early venture capital investors.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.360]   And he basically got them to form a joint stock
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.760]   company to finance his voyage, pay for the crew,
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.160]   the ship, supplies, et cetera.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.240]   And then they agreed what the splitting of the profits
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.960]   would be if he was successful in finding this treasure.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.760]   And boy, was he successful.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.560]   He eventually found the ship, and they hauled up
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.680]   32 tons of treasure, which is almost hard to even picture
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.080]   how much treasure that is.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.960]   And this small group of investors in the joint stock
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.440]   company that financed it each received a 10,000% return
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.920]   on their investment.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.920]   And so once news of this wildly successful treasure
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.040]   hunt and investment spread around London,
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.000]   suddenly there was a boom in these new diving technology
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.720]   companies, which were basically predicated
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.040]   on the very simple thesis that they're all
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.480]   kind of diving apparatuses that would allow a treasure
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.000]   hunter to breathe longer.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.200]   And the thesis was, if you can breathe longer underwater,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.360]   you can look for treasure longer and then increase the odds
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.640]   of you finding treasure.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.640]   And so you had this boom in companies
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.040]   called very straightforward and boring names
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.680]   like the John Williams Company for Treasure Hunting
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.880]   or the Williams Apparatus Diving Technology Engine.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.120]   And they were all just trying to replicate
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.720]   the success of the original treasure hunter
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.080]   and trying to lure early British investors
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.280]   into these speculative ventures.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.480]   And none of them worked out.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.320]   There was never any instance of treasure being found again.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.040]   Of the companies that were in operation in 1694, by 1697,
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.960]   70% of them had been wiped out.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.920]   So it was not a good time to be chasing returns
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.680]   in new technology companies.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.480]   Sounds like some of the dot-com companies in the 1990s.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.720]   It's such a great parallel, because we're both in the '90s.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.000]   Well, after that then came the next bubble,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.960]   which was the South Sea Bubble.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.680]   And this did happen, correct?
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.920]   And could you talk about that?
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.840]   Yes, yes, this one did happen, very much so.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.720]   So first there was the Mississippi Company Bubble
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.440]   in late 1719 and then going into 1720.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.840]   And essentially, both the South Sea Company Bubble
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.800]   and the Mississippi Company Bubble
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.680]   were rooted in the same idea.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.720]   Based on John Law, who was master of the Mississippi
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.920]   Company Bubble, he came up with this theory
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.760]   that while the French government had so much debt
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.240]   and needed to figure out a way to reduce their debt
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.440]   burden and lower their debt expenses, their interest
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.400]   payments, he devised a scheme where he set up a company,
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.120]   the Mississippi Company, that was
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.760]   going to have exclusive trading rights with the Mississippi
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.320]   Territory in the United States.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.000]   And the idea was if the French government could convince
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.040]   its debt holders to exchange their existing government
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.560]   depositions for equity in this Mississippi Company,
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.440]   then they could reduce their debt obligations
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.520]   because debt holders were retiring their debt in exchange
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.600]   for equity shares in this Mississippi venture.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.760]   So you can see how the kind of incentives
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.680]   quickly became misaligned because the government basically
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.200]   had to keep figuring out ways to pump up the Mississippi Company
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.920]   stock price in order to entice investors
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.520]   to part with their existing government debt positions
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.280]   and exchange it for equity.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.680]   And so there was a mania because they
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.400]   were doing so much to pump up the price of this company.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.640]   Then you had some investors pouring
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.280]   in to try and get a piece of the Mississippi Company.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.880]   And inevitably, it blew up spectacularly.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.720]   But what was really funny and kind of a testament to, again,
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.000]   investor amnesia and how investor psychology is just
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.480]   so brutal, that the whole time the Mississippi Company
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.520]   affair was going on, the British were pointing at the French
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.800]   and saying, these idiots in Paris,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.440]   can't they see that this is going to blow up spectacularly
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.520]   and this is going to fail?
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.680]   How could they be so stupid to adopt
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.080]   this system of government debt for equity swaps?
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.600]   And then they did the exact same thing six months later
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.760]   with the South Sea Company.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.240]   It was literally the same.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.240]   Again, the British government tried
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.600]   to retire its debt by getting government bondholders
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.360]   to exchange their debt for equity in the South Sea
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.520]   Company, which was going to have exclusive trading
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.520]   rights with the new Spanish territories that had won
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.480]   independence from Spain.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.080]   And again, it ended up failing spectacularly.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.520]   But it was still the second time in 30 years
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.000]   theme of government lowering rates
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.640]   or coming up with some scheme to try and address
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.400]   the massive debt burden and that fueling speculation,
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.280]   in this case, with direct government involvement.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.840]   But there's also bubbles that occur in everyday common thing,
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.520]   like beer, for example.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.480]   Beer has been around for thousands of years.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:16.920]   And yet, in the late 1880s, there was a beer stock bubble
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.080]   in Europe.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.280]   And so something as common as, say,
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.640]   beer, which had been around forever,
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.680]   even that can create a bubble.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.640]   For the brewery stock bubble, it was set off by the Guinness
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.920]   IPO.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.560]   It formed as a joint stock company
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.880]   and began issuing shares in 1886.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.880]   And that was a really speculative mania
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.240]   when that IPO happened.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.840]   Because in those days, obviously, you
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.120]   had to go hand-submit your order for shares.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.840]   And the day that the Guinness company IPO-ed,
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.880]   the scene outside Barings Bank, who was underwriting the IPO,
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.600]   were just pure chaos.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.120]   And I think the IPO, the shares were oversubscribed something
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.400]   like by 30 times.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.320]   And there was such a mad sea of investors
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.680]   rushing to submit their order forms
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.280]   that Barings Bank had to order in a special police
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.120]   unit to barricade and block the doors.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.680]   And then what the investors did, they
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.280]   began tying their order applications,
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.040]   like their buy orders, to rocks and hurling the rocks
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.560]   through the windows of Barings Bank
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.920]   in attempts to get their orders filled
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.400]   so that they can invest in the Guinness company.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.880]   So that kind of set off this whole boom in brewery stocks
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.720]   as a bunch of other domestic brewing companies
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.760]   started to issue shares as well and take
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.760]   advantage of the speculation.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.320]   Warren Buffett once called it the three I's,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.720]   which is the innovator, then the imitators, and then the idiot.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.400]   And a lot of bubbles in history follow that exact progression.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.520]   After beer came bicycles.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.840]   Coinciding with the brewery bubble of the 1890s,
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.480]   there was actually a shortened and more intense bubble
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.400]   that was running alongside it in the form
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.720]   of a different transportation mania
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.240]   than we would recognize today with the electric vehicle
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.440]   speculation going on.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.640]   It's actually the bicycle that was really captivating
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.920]   investors back in the 1890s.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.400]   And what was happening there was before the kind
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.360]   of modern bicycle frame we would recognize now,
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.040]   that kind of diamond frame, there
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.320]   were the penny farthings, which if people don't know by name,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.600]   those are the bicycles that you see in old movies
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.800]   where there's the massive front tire and then
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.520]   the tiny back tire.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.920]   And essentially what happened in the 1890s
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.880]   was there was few technological innovations
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.840]   in the bicycle industry that led to the creation
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.960]   of the modern frame we recognize now
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.720]   with the two equally sized tires.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.680]   And basically exactly what the bicycle frame looks like today
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.280]   is what it looked like 100 plus years ago.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.000]   And there were some innovations around the tires,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.320]   the welding of tubes to create the frame,
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.240]   and there were some innovations in the ball bearings
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:03.840]   that were used.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.080]   The reality was that bicycles kind of took over the UK
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.440]   population by storm and really had
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.520]   some far reaching implications for society
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.560]   outside of financial markets in terms of, believe it or not,
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.120]   progressing women's rights.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.640]   Because females were buying the bicycles as well,
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.280]   but they at that time were wearing very formal clothing.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.840]   It actually modernized women's wear
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.000]   because they couldn't ride a bicycle while wearing
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.920]   those huge like fluffy dresses with all the frills
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.200]   because they'd get caught in the spokes, et cetera.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.640]   But for financial markets, as people around the UK
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.040]   started going crazy about the bicycle and buying them
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.560]   en masse, the returns for the initial bicycle companies
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.880]   were fantastic.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.640]   And as usually happens in history,
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.360]   that led to an explosion in copycat companies
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.680]   starting up trying to capitalize on the latest fad.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.200]   And so you ended up having in 2 and 1/2 years,
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:07.520]   671 bicycle companies IPO, which is just absolutely insane.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.400]   I think in the fourth quarter of 1896,
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.720]   there was 156 bicycle companies that went public.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.960]   Let's get into another bubble.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.640]   And this happened in the US also.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.720]   And this is the railway bubble.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.880]   I think it was Jack Kenneth Galbraith who
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:28.160]   said that nothing was more fascinating than watching
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.040]   men quickly forget the previous railway mania
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.920]   and go like head first into the next one.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.120]   Because during the 19th century, there
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.160]   were three railway manias in the US and the UK.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.160]   The first one was in the UK in the 1840s.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.000]   And that was its own spectacular mania and bust.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.080]   And then in the US, there was one in the 1850s
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.640]   and one in the 1870s.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.120]   And what's interesting is that the first railway mania
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:01.200]   in the US was less catastrophic and not even widely recognized
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.480]   in the historical literature.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.680]   Most people just focus on the second railway mania.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.840]   But the first one was almost as big.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.840]   And it was not as spectacular or bust
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.280]   as it was for the second railway mania.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.800]   And there was a lot more money made in the first railway
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.240]   mania without as much of the catastrophic losses.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.840]   But in both periods, from 1865 to 1873,
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.880]   there was 30,000 miles of railway track laid.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.440]   And by the late 1890s, especially
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.600]   in the panic of 1893 when the financial markets contracted
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.760]   and credit got tight, there was a massive wave
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.280]   of bankruptcies for these railroad companies
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.160]   that suddenly could not get financing
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.600]   for their operations any longer.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.080]   And there was spectacular bust.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.800]   But one of the interesting points about railway mania,
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.840]   even though there was this spectacular boom and bust,
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.920]   there was actually a benefit to society afterwards
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.960]   because during that speculative period,
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.680]   we laid the groundwork for the railway
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.120]   system in the United States.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.760]   So even though speculators and other financiers
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.320]   might have been left holding the bag,
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.240]   afterwards, they still benefited society
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.000]   because we got to benefit from the railway
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.440]   track that had been laid.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.880]   Now, that's an interesting point.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.960]   And you bring this up in one of your lectures,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.320]   is that a disaster for investors is often
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.040]   a real positive for society and even the economy.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:32.200]   But people lose money in all of these manias that take place.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.880]   There's so much capital being thrown at a particular industry
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.040]   at one time that it causes innovation, which
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.120]   is good for society.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.560]   But a lot of people lose money.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.560]   I want to read you a quote from Warren Buffett.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.200]   And Warren Buffett is famous for losing money
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.200]   in the airline industry.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.680]   And this is what he said in his 2007 Berkshire Hathaway
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.640]   shareholder letter.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.200]   "The worst sort of business is one
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.120]   that grows rapidly, requires significant capital
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.720]   to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.240]   Think airlines.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.240]   Here, a durable competitive advantage
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.640]   has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.240]   brothers.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.320]   Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.520]   had been present at Kitty Hawk, he
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.080]   would have done his successors a huge favor
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.320]   by shooting Orville down."
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.720]   And he's right.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.640]   I mean, look at how airlines have really
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.200]   benefited society and benefited the economy
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.160]   and have been a real positive for all of us
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.440]   to get all over the world.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.600]   And yet, in aggregate, I don't think
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.480]   any money has ever been made in the airline industry.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.400]   It's a great quote.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.480]   Perfect way of illustrating the point we were just
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   talking about, where the speculators and Wall Street
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.200]   investors might be the ones that suffer in the crash,
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.160]   but society as a whole, outside of that small group,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.920]   speculating in the industry, benefit from the aftermath.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.280]   It's like in the tech bubble, when most companies went bust
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.920]   in the tech sector, there was still
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.120]   the groundwork laid with fiber optic cables, et cetera,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.120]   that later was built upon.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.400]   The companies that survived and new companies
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.520]   used that groundwork to build more durable companies
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.440]   on top of it.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.200]   Right place, wrong time.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.640]   Yeah, the fiber optic--
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.760]   we've got WorldCom, Exo Communications.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.800]   I mean, the list goes on and on of these companies
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.120]   that are no longer around today.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.920]   But they built out the fiber optic network
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.800]   that we currently have, that we all run our computers on.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.240]   And we all can talk to each other.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.200]   In fact, I'm talking to you now over fiber optic cable
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.480]   because I'm using voice over IP.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.360]   Sorry you lost money, but it's an advantage to everybody
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.360]   that speculators did do this.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.920]   And we could see it over and over.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.280]   We probably see it right now in many different industries.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.760]   We just sit back and we look at it.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.200]   I mean, the space industry, right?
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.000]   I mean, this is like a big thing now.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.120]   All these very wealthy people are putting money
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.040]   into the space industry, where--
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.520]   I mean, they can't all be profitable in the long term.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.160]   But in the end, it's going to benefit everybody.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.280]   It's the phoenixes that rise from the ashes.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.560]   There's going to be the wipeout.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.280]   But the companies that emerge and are still around
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.800]   are usually the ones that go on to be the dominant players
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.520]   in the industry.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.760]   So at this point, I mean, I don't know anywhere near enough
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.080]   about space exploration to go into any of the companies.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.040]   But like you said, you can imagine
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.440]   that they're not all going to be here in 15 years.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.680]   But there will be some that remain
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.440]   as the dominant players that are probably already
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.040]   in operation today.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.560]   There is also innovation when it comes to investing.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.800]   First Mutual Fund was created back in 1774,
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.640]   where the creators of that fund realized
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.680]   that you need diversification.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:53.680]   So they innovated products that looked like mutual funds
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.200]   back then.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.000]   I know this is another part of your research.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.840]   If you could talk about sort of the innovations
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.720]   to allow commoners, if you will, to invest in these companies,
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.520]   but do it in a diversified way.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:13.520]   This first mutual fund in 1774 also came out of a crisis.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.040]   So basically, what happened was there
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.800]   was a Dutch broker that was named Abraham van Ketwich.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:27.080]   After the summer of 1773, he saw the East India Company,
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.760]   their share prices tanked.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.680]   And there was a lot of financial ruin in London.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.640]   But there were also a number of large Amsterdam
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.680]   financial institutions that have been heavily exposed
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.280]   to the East India Company.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.320]   And so when the share prices tanked,
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.880]   it almost wiped out most of the Dutch major banking
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.000]   institutions.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.760]   And people realized, oh, maybe it's not a good idea
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.760]   to just have everything riding on the price
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.400]   of one single stock.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.480]   And so while the wealthy elite might
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.640]   have had the ability to buy and sell shares of other companies
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.960]   and so they could have a diversified portfolio,
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.600]   the average small investor didn't have a way in that time
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.720]   period to access the market without buying
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.000]   all the individual shares himself, which
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.240]   put that kind of access out of reach
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.440]   for many small investors.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:24.120]   And so after the experience of watching this one stock almost
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.000]   take out the entire financial industry in Amsterdam,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.120]   Abraham van Ketwich decided that he
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.320]   was going to come up with a fund that
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:37.160]   would be able to offer access to the broader
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.480]   market for smaller individuals who could just
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.240]   buy shares of the fund rather than buying the underlying
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.680]   shares individually.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.960]   And so I'm not going to try and pronounce
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.720]   the Dutch name of the fund.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.000]   But it translates to Unity Creates Strength,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.600]   which I think is a fantastic name for the kind
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.720]   of first diversified mutual fund.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.800]   Because again, unity, diversification,
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.160]   creates strength.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.080]   And so what the fund was, it was, I believe,
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.680]   roughly 50 bonds split across 10 different sectors of bonds.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.600]   So there was some plantation loans,
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.800]   which were kind of interesting because they're almost
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.400]   an early mortgage-backed security.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.240]   But there are mortgage loans, kind of canal and turnpike
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.040]   bonds, and then various kind of local government bonds.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.680]   But what was interesting is that it was equally
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.960]   weighted across all of these 10 categories.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.400]   And I think specifically in the prospectus,
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.800]   it mentioned that, one, it said we
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.880]   will hold these investments as proportionate as possible
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.160]   to maximize the diversification benefits.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.840]   Or we will not let any single position be more than, I think,
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.160]   3% of the portfolio.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.920]   But what was really crazy is, well, two things.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.040]   The first is that it was very reminiscent
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.800]   of a modern kind of passive bond fund in the sense
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.880]   that even back then, the fees were relatively low,
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.240]   even by modern standards.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.000]   It worked out to about 20 basis points a year, which, I mean,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.760]   now you can get, probably for two basis points,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.120]   a passive bond fund.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.800]   But still, 20 basis points is fairly low.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.160]   That's 0.2%.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.320]   But the craziest part about this fund
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.440]   was they recognized that active management--
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.760]   and again, this is all in the wake of watching banks
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.640]   get almost wiped out by one stock.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   So in response to that, this fund
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.240]   was heavily focused on no kind of active stock picking,
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.440]   or in this case, bond picking, and no real human element.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.800]   And so to reduce the ability for the portfolio managers
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.600]   to make rash decisions, they bought the underlying shares
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.000]   or the bond certificates.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.720]   And once they held these certificates
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.080]   to prevent themselves from being able to trade,
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.160]   they locked all of the certificates
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.720]   into an iron chest that had three locks.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.880]   And there were three portfolio managers.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.920]   So if there was ever a time where one of them
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.200]   wanted to trade, they would not be able to get access to it.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.800]   And it was only if all three portfolio managers
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.560]   came with their special keys to unlock this iron chest
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.680]   that they would be able to make active investment decisions.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.720]   So basically, you were talking about here
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.360]   is investment management by committee, which
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.680]   is quite popular nowadays.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.840]   Yes, exactly.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.320]   It's kind of a team exercise.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.000]   And it was interesting.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.600]   But it is well and truly, because it
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.520]   is low cost, diversified, and passive.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.920]   It's really the first passive bond index fund.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:30.880]   And how did it do?
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.800]   Was it accepted?
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.200]   This is a really novel innovation in 1774.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.360]   Yeah, unfortunately, it didn't actually do that well.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.120]   But it was a huge step forward for the industry
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.320]   and laid the foundation for future funds.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.920]   What is kind of interesting is that even though he started
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:54.280]   with this passive bond fund, his next fund, Abraham Van Ketwich,
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.480]   was in 1779.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.200]   This one was the world's first value fund.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.520]   Because while the previous prospectus
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.960]   had been talking about how it was strictly
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.200]   going to be kind of passive, equally weighted, et cetera,
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.760]   in this prospectus for the 1779 fund,
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.920]   it explicitly stated that the fund would seek securities
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.480]   that you were able to buy below its intrinsic value.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.160]   So it was explicitly stating that the fund would
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.480]   have a value bias.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.200]   So this guy was really quite the innovator.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.040]   But it's funny to me that he moved
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.280]   from passive to active in a five-year kind of time span.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.920]   So quantitative analysis really began in 1779.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.280]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.040]   Interesting.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:43.000]   Let's fast forward to 1929, where you have isolated--
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.720]   this is the next innovation in mutual funds.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.520]   Yeah, so in the same way that I described,
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.840]   where in the crisis of 1773, that
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.520]   spawned the kind of first passive bond fund in 1774.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:04.200]   After the 1929 crash, there were a large group
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.800]   of investors who became disillusioned
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.480]   with the actively managed investment trusts
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   that they had been putting their money in.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.760]   Because in their minds, the reason
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.400]   that they were paying these managers the high fees
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.320]   was because they expected their expertise to pay off
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.920]   during a crash like 1929 and outperform the market
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.480]   and save them money.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.320]   But in reality, most of these trusts
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.480]   were highly levered and did the exact opposite.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.280]   So a lot of people lost their money
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.880]   despite paying these active fees.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.000]   And so there was a growing frustration and disillusion
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.840]   with the actively managed trust industry.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.880]   And it was, again, in that environment
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.600]   where the next iteration of passive funds
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.360]   was born in the form of fixed trusts, which
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.640]   is aptly named because what the fixed trust meant
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.640]   was once they launched the fund, they
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.000]   were beholden to those specific investments
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.480]   and were not able to make active decisions.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.920]   And this was very popular because of the experience
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.320]   that investors had with active funds in the '29 crash.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.240]   And so quickly, you had an explosion in these trusts
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.640]   as both asset managers realized that this was the movement
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.560]   that they should adopt.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.720]   And so they started pumping out these trusts for people
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.440]   to put their money in.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.320]   But like I mentioned with the progression of Abraham
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.320]   Van Ketwich from passive to active, what was interesting
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.360]   is that the fixed trusts quickly became
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.280]   what they called fixity trusts, where
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.040]   the line between active and passive
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.840]   started to get blurred a bit.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.800]   Because what would happen is if you put out your fixed trust
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.040]   fund in 1930, but there was 50 securities,
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.280]   and then some of them ended up getting bought out
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.640]   or going bankrupt, et cetera, you still
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.480]   said that you're going to be invested in 50,
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.840]   so they had to be replaced.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.000]   And so how do you replace them?
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.600]   Because you said you were going to be fixed and beholden
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.400]   to those set securities.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.960]   And so the management teams started coming up
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.880]   with early factors for deciding what securities would
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.760]   be eligible for replacement.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   And from there, you had funds that
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.480]   were then using those replacement rules
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.840]   as their guiding rules for investment.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.600]   So there was a fund that said if any security in our portfolio
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.400]   drops below their five-year earnings average,
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.040]   then it will be sold out of the portfolio.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.720]   So right there, it's kind of like a earnings-based metric.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.760]   And so it's interesting to see this, again,
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.240]   passive to active transition.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.400]   But they were really the first, and it's
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   so little talked about, which I find interesting,
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.400]   because it's not that long ago, and it's
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.080]   around one of the most famous crashes in US history.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:55.320]   But they were really the first kind of modern index funds.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.680]   And another bizarre example from one of these passive trusts
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.240]   was, in general, these trusts had a more set timeline, which
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.080]   is also interesting.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.640]   So the fund would exist, but it had
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   an end date of, say, 30 years out.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.120]   So you couldn't necessarily hold it for 50 years.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.440]   There was an end date.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.160]   And you could roll it into the next fixed trust
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:14.880]   that they offered.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.920]   But one trust and a couple of others
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.280]   followed suit, started saying, we're
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.520]   actually going to break up this fixed trust earlier,
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.960]   but we'll give you the option to roll over your money
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.720]   into one of our actively managed trusts with higher fees.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.960]   And so you can see that the financial services
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.800]   industry wasted no time misaligning incentives
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.600]   with the smaller retail investors
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.200]   and trying to push them into higher fee funds.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.560]   But the modern mutual fund, meaning the opened-end fund
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.200]   where the manager could just buy and sell at will,
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.240]   I believe the first one was created in 19--
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.560]   1924.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.520]   '24, right.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.720]   Massachusetts Mutual Trust, I believe it was.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.680]   And this was a little bit different
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.320]   in that it wasn't fixed.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.120]   The managers had the ability to buy and sell within the trust.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.920]   And then that became the popular vehicle
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.880]   for doing mutual funds for--
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.920]   well, all the way up until the ETF was innovated in 1993,
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.420]   at least in the United States, although the Canadians will
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:22.080]   argue that they had the first ETF out earlier than that.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.520]   Before I forget, one interesting point left on this fixed trust
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.640]   is that Jason Zweig wrote an article.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.520]   One of those fixed trusts, I think from 1935,
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.600]   is actually still in existence.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.440]   If you just Google Jason Zweig fixed trust,
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.600]   I'm sure you'll find the article.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.440]   But it's interesting.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.240]   We can kind of see out of the original 50 stocks
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.080]   or whatever the trust chose in 1935, what's
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.520]   happened to those securities and how did they
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.760]   perform in the ensuing almost 100 years.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.840]   In my view, the next big innovation
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.480]   occurred in the 1970s.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.200]   And that was the innovation of index funds.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   And that happened for a lot of reasons.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.240]   But I think there was a change in the securities industry that
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.680]   brought the brokerage firms a little bit to their knees
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.000]   and actually created discount brokers.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.320]   That was the elimination, basically by law,
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.400]   of fixed commission rates, where you
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.600]   didn't have to pay an arm and a leg to buy shares of stock.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.640]   So now, when that was eliminated,
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.960]   it gave fund companies the ability
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.520]   to have massive diversification in their mutual funds.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.080]   And that really helped to create the first index fund, which
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.320]   Vanguard and Jack Bogle created.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.800]   I did a podcast, by the way, with Jack Bogle.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.720]   The very first podcast I did, Bogle Heads On Investment.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.640]   Oh, really?
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.040]   Starting strong.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.160]   In fact, it was a few months before he passed away.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.600]   So it was one of the last things he actually did publicly.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.960]   And in there, that podcast, podcast number one
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.440]   of Bogle Heads On Investment, we go
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.960]   through that history of the creation of the first index
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.240]   fund and how it all came about.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.440]   And it was really fascinating to listen to him talk about it.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.840]   There's some stories there that you just wouldn't believe.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.400]   It almost didn't happen.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.560]   It's like a miracle that the first index fund actually
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.600]   happened.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.840]   But let's go on to a different topic.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:14.600]   And that is, in all of your studies of bubbles and busts,
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.840]   let's put together a laundry list of things
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.240]   that you have found help create a bubble
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:28.440]   or get a bubble going in anything-- beer, bicycles,
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.000]   railroads, whatever it is.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.280]   What is the making of a bubble?
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.160]   So I'm going to divert your question to an excellent book
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.800]   by John Turner and William Quinn that just came out earlier
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.880]   this year-- or last year, I guess, at this point--
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.960]   called Boom and Bust.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.720]   And I really like the framework that they put together.
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.920]   They used the fire triangle, which
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.880]   is typically the three sides of the fire triangle
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.120]   are oxygen, fuel, and heat.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.200]   And then there's obviously the initial spark
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.360]   that sets it all off.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.760]   But with those three sides of the triangle, oxygen, fuel,
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.360]   and heat, that's what keeps the fire going and spreading.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.800]   But if you lose one of those, then the fire goes out.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.280]   And so they replaced those sides of the triangle
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.120]   and made them more applicable to finance,
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.680]   where you have the first side of the bubble triangle is oxygen.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.360]   And in this case, for finance, it's marketability.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.640]   And by that, they don't mean marketing and advertising,
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.840]   but the ability to easily buy and sell shares in an asset.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.320]   You mean like the securitization,
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.240]   like securitizing something.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.200]   Exactly.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.440]   And so after that, you then--
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.360]   I guess the grease that keeps it going
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.920]   or the fuel, which is money and credit.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.280]   So in this case, low interest rates, access to cheap money
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.880]   and cheap credit, which helps sustain a boom
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.520]   and creates a bubble.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.560]   And then on top of that, you have
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.240]   the heat, which keeps everything going,
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.680]   which is the speculation.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.640]   So in addition to all this, you have
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   to have the people that are actually going out
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.240]   and speculating in this and keeping it going.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:10.080]   And so those three sides are what keep the bubble going.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.840]   But Spark, that initially sets it off,
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.000]   these two authors posit that it's usually
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   politics and/or technology that initiates the bubble.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.200]   And so some examples from that in history,
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.880]   the technology ones are obvious.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.360]   I mean, the tech bubble is some of the ones
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.000]   we've talked about already with the treasure hunting
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.120]   bubble and bicycle mania, et cetera.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.880]   Those are technology-based.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.440]   But then in terms of the government's involvement,
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.960]   the South Sea bubble, which we touched upon,
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.000]   is another great example where that was the government
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.680]   stepping in and really creating a bubble out of nothing
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.640]   by instituting this ridiculous government debt for equity
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.160]   swap, where you could exchange your government bond
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:55.960]   holdings for shares in a government-backed public equity
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.760]   venture in the form of the South Sea Company.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.080]   So obviously, this doesn't apply to every bubble that's occurred.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.640]   But I think it's a useful framework
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.720]   for figuring out when and why bubbles occur,
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.280]   because in almost all of them, you have these three sides.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.160]   And the original Spark is usually
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.520]   related to politics or technology.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.840]   So we have the oxygen, which is the securitization,
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.640]   if you will, I mean, the availability of the asset
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.080]   that eventually becomes a bubble,
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.440]   whether it's through the IPO market or some new innovation
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.440]   or in the financial industry.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.120]   But you actually have the product
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.280]   that is going to become the bubble, the marketability
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.040]   of it, as you say.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.080]   And then you've got the willingness of creditors
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.280]   to loan money on it or give you money
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.720]   to go out and buy this thing, access to cheap money,
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.240]   as you said.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.960]   People would borrow to buy these things.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.160]   And then finally, you've got interest,
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.400]   which is the speculation.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.320]   I imagine that the speculation or the heat, if you will,
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.080]   is it starts out with a spark.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.000]   I mean, somebody must make a lot of money
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.600]   doing one of these things.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.600]   And then that's, in many ways, the spark
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.960]   that gets everybody going.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.800]   Like, I recall we were talking about Guinness beer.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.120]   Like, that was the first beer IPO that came out.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.440]   And it was just--
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.360]   everybody was familiar with it.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.360]   Now it was available.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.160]   And people started making money right away.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.040]   And that was a spark that caused the beer bubble.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.680]   And I think last year, actually, there
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.880]   was a great example of that, where I personally
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.480]   don't think that it was a coincidence
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.400]   that the kind of explosion in electric vehicle hype
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:38.680]   coincided with Tesla's original really impressive run
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.080]   earlier in the year, where by that point,
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.200]   I think by the time Nikola went public via its SPAC,
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.040]   I want to say it was either May 4 or June 4.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.480]   Tesla was already up like a couple hundred percent
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.360]   for the year.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.360]   And then coupled with stimulus checks and people
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.860]   working from home, there was already
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.000]   that kind of speculative presence.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.080]   And with a name brand like Tesla and younger investors
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.480]   coming into the market and seeing the returns there,
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.200]   then the kind of natural progression
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.400]   was, where's the next Tesla?
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.160]   And then, ironically--
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.200]   The imitators, basically.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.000]   --people turned to Tesla, which shares the name
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   with the original company Tesla.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.520]   It's just the guy's first name, Nikola.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.360]   Right, there you go.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.360]   And that ran up.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.920]   However, I think it was up 80% at one point.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.040]   And the company's first quarterly earnings
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.040]   had revenues of $36,000.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.120]   And that was all derived from installing solar panels
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.240]   on the chairman's house.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:40.040]   So there was no actual real product or earnings,
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.160]   let alone the meager revenues that were not even related
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.600]   to the company's main operations,
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.700]   but let alone the stock soared.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:51.000]   And there are still a ton of electric vehicle companies
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.920]   going public via SPAC or announcing deals
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.000]   and having astronomical share price returns.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.880]   Well, we're going to talk about special purpose acquisition
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.160]   companies in a minute, which are SPACs.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.760]   But you hit on something, though,
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.640]   and it's something that Warren Buffett said.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.680]   You start out with innovation, and then you go to imitation.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.120]   And then the next step is idiocy.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.280]   Is that what he said?
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.080]   And here's where things get crazy.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:24.520]   I was just reading yesterday about a special purpose
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.440]   acquisition company.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.640]   And this came public.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.040]   This is actual public.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.920]   They raised $69 million.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.840]   The ticker on this is J-A-A-C. So phonetically,
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.160]   it's Juliet Alpha Alpha Charlie.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:43.060]   And it's called Just Another Acquisition Company.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.240]   What's the name of the company?
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:49.400]   Management wrote in an S-1 that Just Another Acquisition
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:53.080]   Company may pursue an initial business combination
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.200]   target in any business, industry,
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.120]   or geographical location.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.720]   This is the company.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.360]   And this came public.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.080]   It's like the famous story from the South Sea Bubble,
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.200]   where there was a prospectus for a company,
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.520]   but no one is to know what it is.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.840]   That's right.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.720]   Anyway, so again, getting back to Buffett,
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.000]   there's innovation, there's imitation,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.280]   and then there's idiocy.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.760]   And I have to look at that and say,
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.960]   this is kind of like pure idiocy.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.840]   Who am I to know?
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.280]   Well, the problem is there are too many examples of idiocy
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.400]   with these facts.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.400]   It's hard to pinpoint who the exact idiot is.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.200]   Let's get into then the bust.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.960]   So we've talked about what creates the bubble.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.160]   What then creates the bust?
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.760]   So there are a lot of different ways
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.200]   that the bubble gets pricked throughout history.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.680]   But again, in this boom and bust framework,
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:47.560]   the authors argue that by removing one of those sides,
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.960]   then that leads to the collapse of a bubble
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.880]   because you need all three of those to sustain it.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.560]   And so in terms of cheap money and credit,
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.400]   if rates are suddenly hiked unexpectedly
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.960]   or maybe at a much faster and higher rate than expected,
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.120]   that can help prick the bubble because financing dries up
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.800]   and leads to a credit crunch.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.080]   If, for whatever reason, speculation dies down,
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.280]   then there's the just feedback loop
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.880]   where those speculative stocks will drop in price
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.680]   and they'll continue to drop in price
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.640]   because then the people still speculating
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.360]   will be less inclined to keep buying it
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.960]   because it's going down.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.000]   But then also with the marketability,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.800]   if something happens and shares suddenly aren't as liquid
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.320]   as they were previously,
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.760]   that can lead to problems and bank runs
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.160]   if people suddenly aren't able to as easily buy
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.480]   and sell their investments.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.840]   - I'll add a few things here under
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.440]   when people are not able to easily buy and sell investments.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.680]   I mean, sometimes the government will get involved
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.400]   and they'll clamp down on margin,
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.960]   they'll clamp down on short selling,
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:55.680]   they'll do things that will cause the market to dry up
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:00.680]   and that can create catalyst for the bust.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.400]   And then another thing, by the way,
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.560]   before we even get to the government stepped in,
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:07.520]   it seems like a lot of times fraud
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.040]   tends to get on top. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   So that's a great one that I usually mention.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.120]   And going back to some of the lessons
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.880]   from the online course I put together,
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.240]   one of the lectures was done by Jim Chanos,
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.560]   the short seller.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:28.000]   And he has what I find fascinating kind of framework
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.680]   for looking at fraud and the market cycle,
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:34.520]   where he has said that the fraud cycle
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.840]   operates at a slight lag to the market cycle.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.720]   And you just think about it
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.360]   from an investor behavior standpoint,
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.480]   it makes total sense.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.800]   And the evidence supports this where
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.680]   once the market starts going down a bit,
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.360]   or there's not as much frenzy and speculation going on,
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.200]   that leads to problems for fraudulent companies
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.320]   because any kind of wrench in the gears
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.560]   brings everything to a halt.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.720]   And so what you tend to see
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.000]   is that when people start to lose money
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.760]   in a previously high returning,
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.640]   but maybe fraudulent company,
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.920]   they start scrutinizing their investments much more.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.640]   And that's usually when the fraud gets uncovered.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.560]   - Warren Buffett had a great quote here too.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.720]   He said, "When the tide goes out,
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.360]   "you get to see who's swimming naked."
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.680]   - Exactly.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.240]   - Let's move ahead to today.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.200]   Let's look at where we are today.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.120]   And I don't wanna make any market timing decisions,
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.000]   but what do we have going on today
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   that would be reminiscent of boom and bust?
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.080]   I mean, we certainly have low interest rates,
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.800]   lower than the inflation rate.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.240]   So that's one factor of the triangle.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.320]   I think another factor in the triangle
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.040]   is the oxygen or the marketability.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:49.880]   When we talked about
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.800]   these special purpose acquisition companies,
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.400]   which are nothing more than shell companies
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.880]   which come public for no stated reason.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.840]   A lot of them are celebrity backed.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.320]   Like you could name some celebrities.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.120]   - I think Shaq has the spec.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.480]   - Shaq has the spec.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.280]   And then they go out and they acquire a private company
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.280]   and it's a backdoor way
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.560]   of getting that company on the market
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.880]   without having to do with traditional IPO.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.920]   Hundreds of these things have come out.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.600]   - And in terms of marketability,
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.480]   you were talking earlier
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.080]   about the end of fixed commissions.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.640]   Today, we have that again to a more extreme level
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.560]   with introduction of commission free trading
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.080]   in the fall of 2019.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.760]   And that coupled with fractional shares says,
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.920]   I don't know how you could make buying
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.080]   and selling stocks any easier at this point.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.200]   You can do it on your phone in fractional purchases
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.400]   and with no commission.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.280]   So I don't know how else you can kind of reduce
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.080]   the friction of buying and selling.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.080]   - So we have the oxygen
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.680]   with the spec seeming to continue to come out.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:55.280]   We've got the fuel, which is very low interest rates.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.160]   We've got some speculation going on.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:01.920]   New stocks that have very little revenue
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.840]   shooting to the moon.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.560]   You have to step back and say,
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.520]   is the market, the US market getting a little bit fraught?
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.640]   - I also think it's just strange
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.880]   how you have this kind of bifurcation
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:16.320]   and there's like the dichotomy of bubbles
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.640]   and speculative excess, like you just mentioned.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.760]   But at the same time, you now have value
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.600]   after a decade plus of value underperforming.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.680]   And at the same time that there's all these
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.120]   bizarre speculative manias going on,
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.360]   it's also at the same period where
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:33.760]   value is starting to perform well again.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.600]   And I feel like with the SPACs and electric vehicles
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:42.400]   and GameStop, et cetera, those feel bubbly
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.920]   and they're definitely speculative, but it's siloed.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.760]   There's a, I think James McIntosh
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   at the Wall Street Journal,
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:52.520]   he recently wrote an article using the bicycle bubble
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.400]   as an example where he was talking about how
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.200]   even when the bicycle boom bust,
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:02.240]   it didn't have any broader impact on economy.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.840]   And his point was that there can be bubbles
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.920]   that boom and bust, but the overall market isn't affected.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.880]   And if some of these electric vehicle companies went South,
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.960]   that wouldn't necessarily impact the broader market.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:19.040]   It's different than if every sector in the S&P
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.160]   was feeling speculative,
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.600]   but it's these small enough industries and sectors
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.400]   that I feel like they're bubble-ish signs,
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.840]   but they're mini bubbles.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.160]   - So I like the word silo.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.960]   You said it great, siloing these things is right.
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.720]   There are bubbles in some areas of the market,
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.960]   but will it affect the whole market?
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.320]   Maybe not.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.120]   Jamie, this has been really a great conversation.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.520]   Thank you so much for your time.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:46.520]   And the name of the website is Investor Amnesia.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.640]   So I have one last question for you.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.280]   When is the book coming out?
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.840]   - Whenever I can have time to write one.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:58.760]   That and hosting a financial history podcast
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.440]   are things I often get asked about,
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.720]   and I always respond that I would love to do them.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.320]   I just barely have time to do the work I'm already doing,
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.320]   so I don't know where a book or podcast are gonna fit in.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.320]   - Well, thank you again for being on the show, Jamie.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.880]   I've really enjoyed the conversation
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.120]   and look forward to many great things coming from you.
