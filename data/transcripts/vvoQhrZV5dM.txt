[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.760]   Our first question comes from Aaron.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.920]   Aaron asks, should I exercise before or after deep work?
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.920]   He elaborates, I am a new father and an assistant professor.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.760]   My deep work entails research and writing,
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.840]   which I almost always conduct from my home office.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.240]   I am also highly committed to physical health
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.920]   and lift weights in my home gym, which
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.960]   happens to be in the same space as my office in the basement.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   My most productive work hours are in the morning,
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.200]   but morning is also the best time
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.920]   to exercise from a behavioral perspective.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.520]   How should I structure these two crucial activities?
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.240]   Well, it's not like there's a one right answer, Aaron.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.280]   In general, I do like when possible to get concentrated
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.840]   exercise done during the day.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.120]   I think it breaks things up nicely.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.720]   It helps you avoid falling into this highly unnatural state,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.480]   which is quite common in knowledge work of just sitting
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.120]   and looking at screens all day.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.000]   I let it float.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.640]   It really is part of my planning.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.960]   I actually do this typically at the weekly scale, not
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.480]   the daily scale.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.360]   When I look at my week, I want to get in there
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.640]   and figure out when I want to do daytime exercise.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.840]   And now I can't always do it.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.480]   Some days I'm on campus all day, it's just not going to happen.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.880]   But I want to know where it is.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.600]   I do not want the decision of when
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.040]   do I exercise to be the last thing I figure out that day.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.640]   Because then it's just all going to get
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.560]   pushed into the evening.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.480]   But that's hard, especially when you have kids
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.840]   and other things are going on.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.520]   So I like exercise being done in the day.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.360]   I like planning this ahead of time.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.880]   You can let it move.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.960]   For your particular situation, though,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.320]   I'm going to get more specific.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.400]   I'm going to say work a little bit, a real session,
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.240]   exercise, back to work.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.880]   You have a six-month-old son.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.400]   So I assume you're not sleeping in till 9 AM
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.440]   and finally rolling into your work at 10 AM.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.120]   You're probably up.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.880]   You're probably up.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.920]   If you're doing the handoff right with a child care,
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.160]   and I'm sure you have that figured out.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.660]   I have a session, you have a session
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.200]   before whatever happens with daycare or preschool
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.040]   or whatever, nannies or whatever.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.800]   I'm sure you have the morning figured out,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.640]   some sort of back and forth.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.080]   Get a deep work session in, exercise session,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.400]   then back to deep work.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.960]   OK, that's what I would say for you.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.120]   The other thing I would suggest is maybe interleave more
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.280]   activity throughout your work hours.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.600]   Not, OK, I'm going to disappear for 45 minutes again.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.720]   But every 50 minutes, I am going to do 15 pull-ups.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.120]   Or I'm going to do whatever, jump on the erg
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.000]   for five minutes.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.600]   Someone who does this well is my friend Brian Johnson
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.480]   from Optimize.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.640]   You've heard Optimize be discussed on the show
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.880]   because they're a longtime sponsor of the show.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.880]   But Brian does this pretty well.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.720]   He does not like to sit for more than--
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.440]   I don't know the exact amount of time,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.680]   but it's a little less than an hour.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.160]   So he works exercises like five minutes, intense,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.360]   works five minutes, intense.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.240]   He does this all day.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.640]   He swears that it really helps sharpen his focus.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.560]   So Aaron, I'm going to suggest that too.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.320]   All right, so I'll just put these two things together.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.880]   If you're working from home anyways a lot of days,
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.440]   put your exercise during the day.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.280]   Plan it out and protect it in advance
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.820]   like you would other things.
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.680]   And then my specific advice for Aaron
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.080]   is take little intense activity breaks throughout the day.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.280]   The weights are right there next to you anyways.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.440]   You're working in a gym.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.280]   So you might as well take advantage of that.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.220]   (upbeat music)
