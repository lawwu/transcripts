[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   We got a question here from Coach Pete.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.320]   Coach Pete says, is listening to audio books just as beneficial as
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.880]   reading actual hard copy books?
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.200]   Uh, yeah, just read a lot, read a wide variety, use a lot of formats.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.080]   It's all good.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.020]   It's all good.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.480]   I just think reading is calisthenics for your brain.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.480]   It opens up your brain.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.580]   It's also the source of raw ideas and vocabulary and even argument structure.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.480]   It is the grist that you then chew up in your brain to make
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.740]   that brain way more effective.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.020]   So I just say, read as much as you can and don't sweat the details.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.940]   This is why you'll see, for example, when I do my monthly report on the books, I
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.180]   read that, you know, I'm all over the place, a huge variety of different
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.280]   topics, and I don't care.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.200]   I just, let's go, let's read, you know, let's just, let's just have it going.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.680]   And I think it's the same thing as if you're, if you want to just be generally
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.140]   in shape, do a bunch of different things.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.720]   Bike, I row, I lift weights, I do calisthenics, I do some CrossFit, I'm
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.120]   playing on an ultimate Frisbee team.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.520]   You just throw a bunch of stuff at it.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.480]   It's good for you.
