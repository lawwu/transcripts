[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   - Happy Friday everyone, and welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   Pastor John is back in the studio with me today
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.440]   for a really sharp Bible question
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.580]   on Colossians chapter three, verse three.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.560]   It comes to us from a listener named Josiah.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.600]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120]   for taking my question today.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.040]   How do we reconcile Colossians 3:3,
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.960]   for you have died and your life is hidden
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.280]   with Christ in God, with Ephesians 2:1,
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.080]   and you were dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.240]   I know this refers to our spiritual state of existence
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.720]   before and after Christ.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.540]   I was already dead, and then I died.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.640]   Is that right?
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.260]   Are those who are saved were dead,
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.760]   and then they died again?
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.880]   So dead men die.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.960]   Is that how salvation works in Paul's mind?
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.180]   Pastor John, what would you say to Josiah?
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.520]   - That's a really good question.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.360]   I love this kind of question.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.200]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.080]   (laughs)
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.680]   - I know, I love when people read the Bible
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.360]   carefully enough that they think,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.600]   "How does that fit together?"
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.520]   It seems so strange.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.340]   Those are just golden moments in Bible reading to go deeper.
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.440]   So Josiah has put his finger right
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.520]   on a crucial biblical paradox.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.920]   So Ephesians 2 describes all human beings
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.920]   as dead in trespasses and sins in need of life.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.320]   And then Colossians 3 says we must die
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.880]   in order to have that life.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.080]   That's a good question.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.560]   So the answer is yes, yes,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.360]   dead men must die if they are to live.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.040]   That's true.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.640]   That's the clear teaching of Scripture,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.240]   and there are two senses in which the dead
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.520]   must die in order to live.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.960]   So now if we step back and say,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.880]   "Whoa, that sounds really confusing."
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.920]   (laughs)
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.760]   There are five things that need to be clarified.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   First, in what sense are all people dead
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.520]   apart from Christ?
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.520]   Second, in what sense are those dead people alive
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.120]   while they are dead?
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.920]   Because it's clear those dead people
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.580]   are walking around all around us during the day.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.540]   Third and fourth, what are the two ways
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.160]   that these dead people must die if they are to live?
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.140]   And then finally, fifth, what is the difference
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.140]   between the life we have after this double death
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.460]   and the life we had while we were dead?
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.300]   (laughs)
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.340]   It all sounds very odd, I know,
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.500]   but that's exactly the question.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.620]   Those are questions that the Scripture leads us to ask.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.140]   So here's number one.
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.140]   First, in what sense are all people dead?
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.660]   All people.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.100]   Until God makes them alive in Christ,
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.100]   and here's the way Ephesians 2, 1, and 3 describe it.
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.520]   And you were dead in trespasses and sins
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.060]   and were by nature children of wrath
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.980]   like the rest of mankind.
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.380]   So, this is not just a few people.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.380]   Deadness is what characterizes all of mankind,
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.700]   Paul says, all human beings.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.980]   Here's the way John describes our deadness
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.200]   before new birth.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.060]   We know that we have passed out of death into life
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.500]   because we love the brothers.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.500]   Whoever does not love abides in death, 1 John 3, 14.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.260]   Or here's the way Jesus talks about it, Matthew 8, 22.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.260]   Follow me and leave the dead to bury their own dead.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.300]   And Luke 15, 24, the father in the parable
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.140]   of the prodigal son, this, my son was dead
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.060]   and is alive again.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.540]   He was lost and is found.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.540]   Or here's Paul again in 1 Timothy 5, 6.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.540]   She who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:42.500]   So in what sense then were we all dead
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.980]   before God made us alive in Christ?
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.740]   Paul has several ways of describing our deadness.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.580]   Here's one, Ephesians 4, 18.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.580]   They are darkened, blind in their understanding,
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.760]   alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   that is in them due to the hardness of heart.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.180]   So darkness and hardness.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.180]   Can't see certain reality, can't feel certain reality.
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.740]   What couldn't we see when we were dead?
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.660]   2 Corinthians 4, 4 says unbelievers cannot see the light
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.220]   of the gospel of the glory of Christ
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.380]   who is the image of God.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.680]   And in this darkness, this blindness and hardness,
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.580]   we don't have the moral ability to gladly submit to God.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.500]   Romans 8, 7, the mind of the flesh is hostile to God.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.740]   It does not submit to God's law.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.820]   Indeed, it cannot.
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.600]   And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.280]   So what does our original deadness mean?
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   It means hearts hard and blind to the beauty of Christ
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:09.340]   and therefore in revolt against the will of Christ.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.980]   Second, in what sense are those dead people,
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.660]   all of us before conversion, alive?
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.940]   Because Ephesians 2, 2 also says,
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.380]   they're very, very active, says this.
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.340]   You were dead in the trespasses and sins
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.260]   in which you once walked.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.760]   You're walking, dead men walking.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.780]   Following the age of this world,
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.180]   following the prince of the power of the air,
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.220]   the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.220]   among whom we all once conducted ourselves.
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.700]   So we're dead conducting ourselves in passions of our flesh,
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.180]   carrying out the desires of the body and the mind
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.020]   and we're by nature, children of wrath
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.280]   like the rest of mankind.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.020]   So we are very active dead people.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.020]   In Romans 6, 17 and 6, 20 describes the dead
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.360]   as slaves of sin.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.940]   There was no faith.
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.880]   Without faith, it is impossible to please God.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.820]   We sinned and sinned and sinned.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.300]   So the dead were very active slaves,
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.160]   but nothing came from faith.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.300]   Third, now here comes this double clarification,
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.860]   third and fourth I said.
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.980]   There are two senses in which the spiritually dead
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.500]   need to die in order to live.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.500]   First, they need to be united with Christ
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.500]   so that his death counts as their death.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.500]   Romans 6, 5, we have been united with him
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.940]   in a death like his.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.940]   And then Galatians 2, 20, I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:10.320]   Romans 6, verse 6, our old self was crucified with him.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:17.740]   So this union with Christ in his death
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.580]   happens through faith.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.580]   When we believe in Christ, God counts his death
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.920]   to be our death.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.940]   This means that the condemnation owing to our sins
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.340]   falls on Christ.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.780]   And because of our union with him,
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:46.780]   we are now counted free from punishment,
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.300]   no condemnation for those united to Christ,
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.500]   that is in Christ.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   So that old, hard, blind, rebellious, dead self
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:05.540]   is now freed from guilt.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.340]   Its sins are punished, covered.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.700]   Now what?
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.700]   And here's the second sense in which the dead must die.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:24.020]   Our old self, our old blind, hard, rebellious nature
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:32.300]   is replaced by a defining new nature, a new person.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:39.860]   This is what the new birth does, new creation.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.820]   This is a real transformation.
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.520]   Paul describes the ongoing experience
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.900]   of this newness like this.
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.900]   You have put off the old self with its practices
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.960]   and have put on the new self,
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.980]   which is being renewed in knowledge after its image,
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.580]   after the image of its creator, Colossians 3, 9 and 10.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.580]   So the original dead person passes through two deaths
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.060]   on the way to life.
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.940]   The hard, blind, rebellious, dead self
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.940]   is miraculously, graciously, freely, sovereignly by God,
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:35.040]   united to Christ as God creates faith in the heart
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.980]   so that all the punishment that dead man deserved
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.000]   was endured by Christ.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.960]   And in that same instant, in that same act of faith,
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   God creates a new nature in us,
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.800]   which leads now to one last question, fifth clarification.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.760]   What is the difference between the life of this new nature
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:12.760]   and the life we had when we were dead?
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.800]   Let's let Paul answer the question
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   because he does it so beautifully in Galatians 2, 20.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.400]   There are not many verses more preciously personal
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   in Paul's writings than Galatians 2, 20.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.800]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.460]   And the life, now this is my answer to the question,
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.840]   what's the new life that you have
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.600]   after this double death that you walked through?
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.720]   The life I now live in the flesh,
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.040]   and gave himself for me.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   So the new nature that God created in the new birth
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.800]   is a nature that has faith in the Son of God.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.480]   It is a nature that believes.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.700]   It is not hard.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.800]   It's tender to the truth and the beauty of Christ.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.840]   It's not blind.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.200]   It sees the supreme worth of Christ.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.180]   It's not insubordinate and rebellious.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.180]   It gladly submits to the Lordship of Christ.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:37.560]   So yes, Josiah, the dead must die in order to live.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.480]   And what a glorious work Christ has wrought
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:50.120]   in his death and resurrection to make that happen.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.240]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.560]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.040]   You can ask a Bible question of your own,
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.760]   search our growing archive,
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.040]   or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.440]   all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.620]   Well, Monday, we have a great topic coming up.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.000]   It's a great one for those of us
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.040]   who wanna teach Christian hedonism.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.480]   Now, how do we make it our own?
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.460]   Or to ask a question even more broadly,
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.500]   how do we take the key teachings of others
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.460]   and incorporate them into our ministry
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.860]   so that we're not just mimicking our teachers?
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.080]   That's an important question faced by any budding
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.960]   Christian communicator, writer, teacher, or preacher.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.700]   And that's a question on the table on Monday.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.140]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.080]   We'll see you back here on the other side of the weekend.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.920]   See you then.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:49.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
