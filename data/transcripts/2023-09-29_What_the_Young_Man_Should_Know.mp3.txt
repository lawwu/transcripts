[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.560]   ♪
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.680]   Glancing out the window, I can see the subject, and eventual victim of this inquiry,
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.440]   dangerously perched in the crotch of an old chestnut tree about 15 feet above the ground.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.240]   Should I rush out and tell him to get down? Or should I let him be, hoping that he won't
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.760]   climb any higher? Or, if he does climb any higher, hoping that he will not fall?
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.040]   It is probably alright, so I shall not bother him. Tree climbing is one of the things he has
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.320]   learned all by himself. There aren't many things he will have the fun of learning all by himself.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.920]   Most of the things he is going to learn will be hammered into him. Latin and history and grammar
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.800]   and mathematics up to the binomial theorem. I'm not worried about his progress up the ladder from
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.360]   high school or boarding school to college and from college to law school or medical school.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.920]   It seems incredible that the young biped, now perched in the chestnut tree, will someday,
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.680]   without stupendous effort on my part or on his, eventually graduate from college or
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.880]   even become a PhD. But he will, almost certainly. The strictly educational side of his life,
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.600]   once he gets his hands firmly on the lowest rung of that ancient ladder, will take care of itself.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.640]   What concerns me is something entirely different, a good deal more like tree climbing.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.760]   I have never heard of a school or college that gave a course in tree climbing,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.320]   and human life is full of useful accomplishments and rewarding experiences like tree climbing,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.920]   like making a speech for example, or being able to take care of oneself on a camping trip,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.200]   abilities that seem to me at least as valuable as a knowledge of conjugations and the dates of
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.560]   battles, perhaps if one is to become a self-sufficient well-rounded human being,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.720]   much more valuable. What are those abilities, skills, or accomplishments, those
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.320]   extracurricular proficiencies that every man should have in order to be
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.360]   rounded and self-sufficient, and when can he acquire them, and how?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.400]   Let me return, without looking at him, for he is probably by now 30 feet above the ground,
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.560]   to the 7-year-old imp in the chestnut tree. Impartially adding up to myself his skills,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.520]   other than tree climbing, I find that he cannot count money or give change, that he is unable to
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.240]   tie his own shoelaces, that he would most certainly starve if left alone in a well-stocked kitchen,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.600]   but on the other hand, that he can perform a rather startling back somersault off a diving board,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.680]   that he speaks and understands elementary German, and can sit down at the piano and play with only
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.320]   a few mistakes, a Mozart minuet. Clearly, to this handful of skills and accomplishments,
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.360]   he must add others, many others, before he is even on the road to becoming a self-sufficient and
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.840]   well-rounded young man. Leaving all formal subjects out of consideration, he should learn
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.120]   how to swim, handle firearms, speak in public, cook, typewrite, ride a horse, drive a car,
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.920]   dance, drink, and speak at least one foreign language well. The list does not end there.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.000]   There are several dozen mental and physical skills that I should like him to acquire.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.040]   He will acquire some of them in the mere course of growing up. He will acquire some of them more
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.400]   painfully as the result of adult pressure. There are others that he will avoid, and he will
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.000]   eventually be punished for their omission with not a little discomfort and social misery.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.760]   Ordinary education, even high-priced education, will not guarantee him the essential skills,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.320]   and some of them are better learned after "education is over." It is up to me to set
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.800]   about making a list of those skills. It is up to me to see to it that he gets them,
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.720]   because they are skills of hand, eye, ear, or brain, which will enlarge, deepen, and ripen him
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.040]   as a human being. But how, you may ask, can a young man be enlarged by learning to handle
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.720]   firearms? In what conceivable way will he be ripened by knowing how to cook or drink? Patience.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.480]   In asking what these things are that every civilized, intelligent, educated young man
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:06.720]   should know, remember that I am thinking of skills, not contents. Of outside interests and
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.160]   non-scholastic activities, rather than of the stream of Latin, Greek, physics, social science,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.360]   Jacobean poetry, and elementary beekeeping, which, from kindergarten to senior year, will moisten,
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.920]   but not clog, the sieve that is his mind. And so, let me hasten to turn away from the mountain
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.400]   range of modern education, which threatens to cast its shadow over this discussion.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.480]   Let me mention once, and then not mention again, the project method, John Dewey,
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.080]   intelligence quotients, and the Dalton plan. The average high school or boarding school is not
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.480]   modern and will give your son and mine little beside formal education, and even more formal
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.640]   sport. One will get him into college, and the other may leave him with a peculiarly atrocious
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.520]   form of hick-athletic patriotism. If we parents do not supplement what is given by the usual schools,
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.600]   our sons will come out of them mere Christian stockbrokers with an abnormal craving for bodily
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.040]   exercise. If we want our sons to be able to drive a car, speak French fluently, play the piano,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.840]   set a broken leg, and make horses do their bidding, we shall have to look outside of these
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.720]   schools and colleges. And I submit that he who cannot do these things is not completely educated.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.280]   The list of skills, as distinct from book learning, does not include mere parlor tricks,
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.040]   such as playing the ukulele, fortune-telling, a startling acquaintance with the insides of
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.320]   the Encyclopedia Britannica, or other accomplishments whereby the fierce psychology
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   advertisements promise to make their victims the life of the party, or a successful salesman in
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.920]   ten lessons. And the list does not include the special aptitudes necessary to a man in
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.560]   this profession, or the accomplishments which aim at the development of his character.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:03.280]   The skills I have in mind may fortify character, but chiefly as a by-product. They will make life
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.560]   richer and therefore happier, though happiness itself is usually a by-product. They are tools
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.400]   which will help a man to mine his own vein of gold and some of the gold in the world about him.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:23.040]   Some of them will save him discomfort, some of them will bring satisfaction and pleasure,
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.280]   some of them will help him avoid danger and give him the joy of mastery over animal fears.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:37.520]   Some are elementary and taken for granted, others are rarer accomplishments not always striven for.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   It seems obvious that our young man should know how to swim. More specifically,
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.080]   he should know how to swim at least a mile, dive creditably, and not feel panicky underwater.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.680]   No parents will disagree on this point, since anyone who does not know how to swim stands in
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.760]   some danger of being drowned. Swimming is valuable not only to preserve life, but because the fear of
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:08.320]   water is instinctive, and the most civilized man is the one who has conquered all that makes him
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:15.760]   afraid and that can be conquered. Not only should our young man be able to dive courageously and
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:22.960]   neatly, but he should be able also to revive those less skillful than himself by rolling them on a
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.080]   barrel and pumping their helpless arms, though I do not insist that every young man should be
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.480]   a lifeguard. If he learns all the other accomplishments expected of him, he will have
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:40.000]   little time left for that. He should be able to drive an automobile well. By well, I mean far
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.080]   better than most people do now. Of all our conveniences, the automobile is the most docile
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:54.480]   and the most dangerous. It seems to encourage a perilous discourtesy. People who always answer
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.200]   letters, smile when spoken to, and rise when ladies enter the room think nothing of hogging
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:06.320]   the road or passing on a curve. Our young man should drive safely or not at all, and he should
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.920]   not be altogether helpless when a car breaks down. He must know how to change a tire and offer some
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.640]   sort of diagnosis when the engine sputters and dies. My list does not include a knowledge of
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.600]   how to pilot a plane. Good pilots are born, not made. A man should stay on the ground unless
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.320]   peculiarly fitted for the air. He may be as air-minded as you please, but unless he is air-bodied
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:39.120]   and air-reflexed, this modern skill should be left severely alone. He ought to know how to clean,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.920]   load, and shoot a revolver or a rifle. Someday he may have to in self-defense. And shooting at a
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.760]   target is also good fun and an excellent discipline for hand and eye. I should like my son to be able
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.080]   to hit a silver dollar at fifty yards, and I should insist that he be able to manage a gun so
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:04.160]   as to injure no one but the target. He must not be the kind of duffer who makes bystanders nervous.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:11.840]   I do not advance shooting as valuable for reasons of citizenship or military training. I prefer that
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:17.600]   what he shoots at be inanimate. He may develop a passion for shooting duck, grouse, and deer,
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.800]   without my blessing, for it seems to me that the longing to assassinate wild animals is a
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.280]   barbarous and childish method of asserting the superiority of the human race and
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.840]   considerably less civilized than dueling. As for self-defense, a man should certainly be
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.440]   able to take care of himself in a scrap. He need not learn jujitsu. Old-fashioned boxing will be
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.040]   enough. He will get some of this in school. He should get enough of it so that he can give and
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:51.120]   take a good smack on the jaw, whether in friendship or anger. No matter how short the list of his
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:58.880]   accomplishments, this should be one of them. The Soviet Russians, who have seldom hesitated to use
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:06.240]   firearms against those whom doctrine forces them to consider enemies, hold boxing to be brutal and
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:13.200]   forbid it to their young men. Let us register our disagreement and pass on. He should learn how to
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.320]   take care of himself in other ways. He ought to know the rudiments of camping, how to build a fire,
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.920]   how to chop wood, how to take a cinder out of his eye, how to deal with a severed artery,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.440]   how to doctor himself for ordinary ailments. He should also be able to take care of other people
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.840]   in emergencies, to apply first aid, set a broken bone, revive a drunk or a victim of gas, deal with
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.760]   a fainting fit, administer the right emetic or antidote for a case of poisoning. And he should
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.840]   be able to feed himself, to cook, not only because someday he may need to, but because cooking is one
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.360]   of the fine arts and a source of infinite pleasure. He should be able to scramble eggs, brew coffee,
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:59.040]   broil a steak, dress a salad, carve a chicken, and produce on occasion one first-class dish,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:05.280]   such as onion soup. The more he can do in these days of the delicatessen store and the kitchenette,
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.640]   the better. It is not effeminate, it is not beyond him, and the best chefs are all men.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.880]   Our hands, originally the keys used by man's brain to unlock the whole wide world, are in this age
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:26.080]   of patent appliances in some danger of withering through disuse. A man may go through life without
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.720]   using his hands for anything more difficult than gripping a golf club, signing letters,
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.280]   fumbling for coins, lighting a cigarette, opening a bottle, and holding a telephone receiver.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.520]   When the furnace goes out or the radio goes dumb or a door won't close or a pipe leaks,
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.520]   he has to send for an expensive expert. Therefore, our young man should learn to be handy in repairing
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.440]   the trifling faults of his home. Of course, he may live all his life in apartment houses and be
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:57.520]   spared such attention to trifling faults, but if he must live in apartment houses, I had rather him
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:04.560]   do so from choice than from incompetence. He should know how to use paintbrushes, a saw, a hammer,
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.480]   and other common tools. It is much more fun than he might think. It adds to his self-respect,
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.800]   it satisfies the throttled manual ape, and it supplies one of his few contacts with the remote
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.360]   world of physical labor. One of the best tools he can use is practically unknown among those who
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.960]   have not spent some time in a newspaper office—the typewriter. Our young man should also have a
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:35.440]   beautiful and distinguished handwriting. He will not learn this in any school. Schools are as likely
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.280]   as not to ruin whatever handwriting he might have had. But handwriting should be reserved for special
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.880]   occasions. The bulk of his writing, particularly if he is a professional man who has much of it to do,
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.680]   should be done on a typewriter. I do not mean poking at the machine with two fingers, but
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:57.840]   full-fledged touch system capable of turning out 3,000 words an hour. This talent will be
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.520]   enormously useful. Spread widely enough, it might even revive the lost art of letter writing and
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.280]   undo some of the harm, the laziness, the mental as well as verbal sloppiness induced by the appalling
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:17.040]   habit of dictating to a stenographer. He should play one outdoor game well, and have a workable
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:24.000]   smattering of several more. To my eye, an American who cannot throw and catch a ball seems pathetic
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.920]   and grotesque. Perhaps I am prejudiced, and baseball, except for boys and a small band
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.680]   of professionals, is a lost cause. The usual American game is golf. So let him learn,
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.840]   for the sake of human contact and outdoor recreation, to go around the course in at most 110.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:48.720]   If it were a question of my own son, I should try to steer him toward tennis—a livelier game and
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:56.080]   prettier to watch, and one with more possibilities of mental release than golf, which often undoes in
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:02.400]   discouragement, obsession, and emotional strain the good it does as exercise. A game should not
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:10.640]   be an end in itself, as is often true of golf, but a relaxation and a complete contrast to the
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:17.520]   sedentary. There is something a little sedentary about golf. The bicycle is gone, yet every boy
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.960]   should know how to ride one. Don't ask me why. He should also be able to skate, sail a boat,
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:29.040]   and handle a canoe passably. Fishing is a specialty like chess. Those who have it in them
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.960]   will eventually find themselves doing it. Those who do not feel the call need not bother.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   It is a singular commentary on college athletics to realize how few sports a man can get along with
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:47.520]   quite happily after graduation. How quickly the vast array of football, soccer, pole vaulting,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:53.200]   basketball, water polo, lacrosse, hurdling, handball, rowing, wrestling, fencing shrinks
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:01.280]   in after life to golf or tennis, or surprisingly often to occasional sweat in a steam cabinet.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:09.920]   Walking is a noble but neglected sport. Americans hike once in a long while, but seldom walk.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:15.680]   And biking easily becomes hitchhiking. The automobile, organized athletics,
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:21.120]   and the fact that American cities and American suburbs are dismal places to walk in,
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:28.080]   have caused American feet to abandon the roads. For every climber in an American national park,
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:35.440]   some of which are quite as beautiful as any Alps, there are 10 hikers, 50 who pack on horses,
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.160]   and 10,000 who survey the wonders of nature from the windows of a sedan.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:46.160]   Walking in this country is a lost cause, yet walking is one of the habits I should wish my
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.720]   son to acquire. No other exercise, if indulged in several days at a time in pleasant, moderately
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:17:00.080]   wild country, has greater power to remake a man, to iron out his creases, to produce deep health
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:06.160]   and spiritual calm. The first steps in this elementary course had best be taken in Europe,
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.120]   where the natives do not look upon people with heavy shoes and knapsacks as slightly cracked.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:17.360]   Everyone should know a great deal about animals. It is natural for boys to collect stray dogs,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.960]   and all children seem instinctively to be much more interested in every other branch of the
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:29.040]   animal kingdom than their own. It is equally natural for the city and suburban boy to grow
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.160]   up with no more contact with animals than Mickey Mouse and an occasional trip to the zoo.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.080]   Kindness to animals and an understanding of them has become in modern life a skill that must be
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:47.280]   nourished and artificially trained. I do not expect my son to become a Raymond Dittmars or
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:52.640]   a William Beebe, but I shall think him lacking unless he has much to do with animals and gets
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:59.280]   on well with them. Civilization has hustled us all horribly fast and horribly far away from our
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:05.520]   primitive state, from the time, biologically not very long ago, when man's life depended a great
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:13.040]   deal on animals. A certain return to nature is healthy and desirable. The best animal for the
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.400]   purpose of this return to nature is the horse. I insist, then, that a boy should have many horses
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.040]   in his life and should learn how to stay in a saddle with pleasure to himself and a minimum
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.320]   of annoyance to his mount. Riding is one of the required studies in my curriculum,
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:34.240]   valuable both as one of the possible victories over physical timidity and as a source of pleasure.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:40.000]   With riding should go some knowledge of how to take care of a horse, but I should not like my
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.200]   son to become horsey. Horsey people are victims of an obsession even worse than golf. They lead
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:54.560]   mentally four-footed lives and the spiritual aroma of the noblest of beasts clings to them as the
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:02.240]   smell of straw and manure clings to the stables. It is a clean, time-honored smell, but a bit too
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:08.880]   pervasive. I have three fears for the future of my son, that he will join the army, enter the church,
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:17.920]   or become horsey. Trivial but important because one can be so uncomfortable if one does not know
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:24.640]   them are the parlor amenities. A boy should learn how to dance. Good dancers, like aviators,
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:31.600]   are born. But anyone can learn to do modern, real estate dancing, that form of rhythmically
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.480]   bumping into other people in a small space with a technique dictated by the high land value of
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:42.480]   the places where dancing is usually to be found. The kind of dancing that is really fun is extinct
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:49.360]   in America. Social dancing is no great art, but essential if one wishes between the ages of 16 and
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:55.840]   22 to become acquainted with more than a few specimens of the opposite sex. As to card games,
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:02.160]   I play bridge so badly myself that I am prejudiced against it. If one plays bridge well enough to
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:08.240]   enjoy it, one probably plays too much of it to the exclusion of better things. As a refuge from
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:15.040]   boring conversation, it is without equal. Backgammon, though useful for the same purpose,
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:22.880]   is a monotonous blind alley. Pool and billiards are specialties. From these indoor pastimes,
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.600]   our student can pick one optional elementary course, which will be given at the pleasure
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.760]   of the instructor. Even more trivial, but infuriating if one is clumsy at it,
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.600]   tipping. It would be very pleasant to go through life with a knowledge of how to tip
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.400]   naturally, justly, without fear and without reproach. American social habits being what
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.920]   they are, there is one indoor skill which seems to me not only far more important than bridge or
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:58.480]   dancing, but actually compulsory. Drinking. A young man who could convince me that his lips
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.560]   really would never touch liquor might be let off my required course in drinking, but he would be an
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.880]   exceedingly rare bird, and alcohol is so much more evident a liquid in the United States than water
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.080]   that it is probably quite as necessary for a young man to learn how to drink as it is for him to
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.520]   learn how to swim. If the youth of the country had been taught how to drink, just as they were
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.320]   taught not to eat between meals or swallow before they had chewed, we should never have had
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:33.040]   prohibition. It is a more difficult art than most, for every man reacts differently, and every man
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:40.560]   should know long before the time when, according to our customs, he indulges in his first collegiate
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:48.080]   binge, whether liquor goes to his head, his legs, or his morals, whether he is the type that sings,
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:55.520]   fights, weeps, climbs lamp posts, or pinches the girls. Furthermore, he should learn his capacity
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.680]   and stick within its limits. He should know something about the different kinds of drink,
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.600]   and which drinks produce chaos within him when mixed. By all means, let him leave drink alone
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:11.760]   if he wants to, but since nine times out of ten he will drink, let him do so sensibly.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.320]   I have omitted from this list all mention of women, not so much because it is a subject of
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:24.640]   appalling breadth, leading to endless discussions of chastity, frustration, fulfillment, birth
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.400]   control, curiosity, mate hunger, and other less printable but even more important topics, because
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.680]   in regard to the other sex, the fairly well-educated seem to be at as great a disadvantage
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.880]   as the rest of mankind. What every high school, boarding school, and college graduate should know
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.000]   is no different from what every man should learn in this darkest and most unteachable province of
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.600]   human conduct. I shall not be the one to tell students of this course what acquired skills can
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.880]   prevent mistakes and heartache. Where sex is concerned, nature clearly intended us to make
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:04.880]   many mistakes in her hope that some of them would be productive. I shall certainly be in a minority
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:11.360]   in suggesting that our sons should know the rudiments of gambling. Gambling might be placed
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:17.680]   on the same plane as drink. The less use one has for it, the better. And the sooner America gives
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:23.920]   up gambling, not only at card tables, roulette wheels, and slot machines, but in stocks and bonds
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:29.920]   of equally mysterious and unpredictable corporations, the better also. But gambling in
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:36.400]   one form or another seems to be a national habit of mind. Almost every American gambles at some
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:42.000]   time in his life, and there are things valuable in other departments of life which gambling can teach.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.920]   To be a good sport, to be a good winner as well as a good loser, especially when games are played
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:55.360]   for money. Not to brood over the irrevocable, not to give way to retroactive daydreams and say,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.480]   "If only I had put a big stack on double zero. If only I had sold out in August 1929."
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:09.840]   October of that year was the rout of the amateur gambler, and the crash revealed this country to be
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:16.960]   singularly full of poor losers. Important as it is to be a good loser in public, it is even more
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.600]   important to learn not to try to turn the hands of the clock backward in the privacy of one's own
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:28.880]   soul. Higher than almost any other accomplishment on the list do I place music. There is no reason
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:34.240]   why any boy who is not absolutely tone deaf should not learn how to play one musical instrument well
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   enough for it to be a self-resource and a tolerable pleasure to others. If it were not for
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:46.080]   the certainty that our educators would make it as deadly during school and as shunned in afterlife
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:52.480]   as that badly embalmed language, I should advocate the substitution of music for Latin as a required
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.080]   subject. Music is or ought to be an essential part of every civilized human being's life.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.480]   Economic necessity, the radio, and the phonograph have put the playing of music beyond most
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:10.960]   Americans. Our children should bring this back. My choice would be the piano. The violin is far
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:17.200]   more painful in incompetent hands, and most other instruments are not meant to be heard singly.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   The saxophone and the ukulele should be placed on par with the taking of drugs.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:27.120]   There is much to be said for being able to sing parts decently, and any amateur who knows the
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:33.840]   words of even the commonest songs is a phenomenon. I realize that even this is asking a great deal.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.720]   Perhaps I expect too much. My students will receive a passing grade if they can sit
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.360]   and listen to good music intelligently and, moderately often, without pressure.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:50.720]   A civilized man should know how to read. The ability to read, or rather the habit of reading,
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.000]   is very rare even among intelligent people and has to be taught and kept up if it is not to
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.280]   become rusty. The educators tumble over one another with new methods of teaching children
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:07.200]   how to make sense out of print, but not a single pedagogue, so far as I know, has successfully
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:12.400]   tackled the problem of how to keep people reading books once they have learned that it can be done.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:17.440]   Incidentally, if someone were to write a little book called "How to Read the Newspapers,"
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.840]   he would earn the undying gratitude of those who search hurriedly for the sports,
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.840]   the market, the obituaries, glance at the headlines, and then throw all the newspaper
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   on the floor. If the young man over whose head hangs this list of accomplishments could not find
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:37.920]   time because of the necessity of healing for the news or keeping dates with co-eds, for more than
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.880]   a few of these skills, let a fluent reading and speaking knowledge of at least one foreign
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.560]   language be among them—French or German, preferably both. A parent must expect no help
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:53.760]   from schools in the teaching of foreign languages, or rather, such is the impression of the student
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:27:00.320]   who goes to the average school, in the teaching of irregular verbs. Governesses and tutors,
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:06.480]   little trips abroad in adolescent summers, can start a false spring which withers and dies as
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.840]   soon as the child goes to a regular school. Everyone learns one language as he learns to walk.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.960]   The learning of more ought not to be so hopeless, but hopeless it is for Americans.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:23.680]   Parents should form a foreign language study association and devise ways to supplement and
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.040]   combat the schools. German children learn an amazingly good brand of English without ever
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:35.040]   crossing their borders. Why can't we? For one thing, we don't really want to, yet we should.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:42.240]   An American who knows only English is blind in one eye. Corollary to this are the skills and
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.600]   experiences that come from travel, and the tolerances and curiosities about other sorts
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:54.240]   of people that only travel can produce. To travel well, efficiently, without fuss or complaint,
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.200]   without asking why porters are so stupid, or blaming the Italians for speaking their
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:05.120]   own language is no small accomplishment. But what I have in mind is a wider mental habit,
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.320]   an ability to think as a citizen of the world, to meet foreigners upon their own terms,
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.560]   to circulate freely and receptively in London without giving in to that
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.920]   curious chameleon temptation to be at the same time a little ashamed of one's own country,
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.880]   and to imitate the British. The British have it over us in two particulars.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:31.520]   Their educated men talk well in public and handle their own language and speech and writing as if it
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:37.600]   were a familiar object. Our young man should be able to express himself clearly before a crowd of
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:44.560]   strangers without shyness, muddle, or a pathetic resort to "so much has been said and well said"
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:51.040]   or "I did not expect to be called on." Children somehow get over the terror of saying "how do you
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:56.080]   do" to strangers, but the American adult who can get to his feet, propose a toast,
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.920]   introduce a stranger, voice a civic protest, heckle a windbag politician,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.960]   and give utterance to an unembarrassed thought is a museum piece.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.400]   And a man should command the elementary tool of written language and be able to put simple
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:18.720]   things on paper in clear words, for in its essentials writing is not a mysterious art,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.280]   but a human function as possible to learn as walking or eating.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:30.240]   On the borderline between skills like these and book learning are all such things as a sound
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.520]   smattering of the theatre, painting, opera, a good workable understanding of the structure of
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:41.360]   business, investments, and banks, which in real life are not quite as they seem in the textbooks
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:48.320]   of economics. To these skills and knowledges I would emphatically add certain experiences.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:56.400]   The educated young American male is in peril of too much shelter, too little danger and privation,
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:02.080]   and would be the richer if he had at some time in his life been without money and gone hungry for
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:08.880]   several days, been lost or shipwrecked, been robbed, been in jail, and spent a few months
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:15.760]   working as a common labourer. This last I place high on the list. Let every educated man, as a
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:22.000]   necessary part of his education, be thrown into the muddy stream of American industry and see
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.880]   what it is like to swim alone on daily wages. The list of extracurricular accomplishments
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.680]   must come to an end or our young friend will not pass his board examinations.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:41.120]   One more desideratum. He should before reaching twenty-two have done something because he wanted
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:48.080]   to, whether other people wanted him to do it or not, sailed a boat on a perilous course, or shipped
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:54.480]   as a common seaman, or taken a job on a newspaper, or motored across the continent, or gone off to
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:01.760]   Europe on his own, or learned boiler-making, anything so long as it was his own idea.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.440]   And how does one make healthy young middle-class Americans want to do something if all they want
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:16.400]   to do is enjoy themselves? If I knew that! And into the young man's bag of tricks I should
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:21.920]   certainly insert the accomplishment of not acquiring property unless he needs it.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:28.800]   The other skills I have proposed for him will not cost much money, so that he will be able,
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:35.120]   and also tempted, to record the increase in his standard of living by adding to his furniture,
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.280]   by buying a better car or an oil furnace, by going in for collections of medieval armor
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.640]   or ancient coins, and similar surrenders to the magpie streak in all of us.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:54.880]   Property quickly crowds out and preys upon less tangible pleasures, and is so often preferred to
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:01.520]   the fun one can have with one's body or one's mind, because the joy of its acquisition is so immediate
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:09.280]   and keen. Property of a decorative or useless nature is, indeed, often more fun in anticipation
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:17.440]   and at the moment of its acquisition than it ever is again. Insensitiveness to his personal property,
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:23.680]   unless, of course, it is extraordinarily beautiful, is a desirable skill for any man to have,
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.520]   and, like swimming, bridge, or German, it must be learned and worked at.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:36.080]   What a ferocious program, you may say, and how in the world is it, or even a quarter of it,
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:42.000]   to be put into effect, granted a normal male specimen of the race? Only a fraction of it will
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.160]   be acquired in school, we all admit. Parents are busy, and except in rare cases, parents are the
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.840]   worst possible teachers of their own children who know them far too well. Summer camps can do some
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:00.160]   of it. American schools grant long holidays to their pupils from June to October, and the pupils,
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:07.040]   if left to themselves, use the holidays to wipe out as much education as possible, with a useless,
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:14.480]   unsystematic, healthy, good time. For this idle summer, the camps substitute a schedule of outdoor
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.840]   skills, and the boy who goes to summer camp usually comes back knowing how to swim, fish,
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:25.600]   paddle a canoe, toss a flapjack, and not cry too much when hurt. The skills taught by the summer
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:31.600]   camp end with outdoor sports. Yet parents are dimly aware of how little school teachers really
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.800]   teach, and cling to supplementary education like that of the summer camps when they can get it.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:43.360]   Why not enlarge the camps and to their outdoor curriculum add German, taught as thoroughly as
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.800]   they teach canoeing? Why not, in fact, apply the basic principle of Americanism and have two
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:56.080]   systems of education competing against each other? On one side, the formal schools pouring contents
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:02.000]   into rebellious minds. On the other, summer camps, where the children are taught definite
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.560]   human skills, some of them much better taught than the schools can ever expect to do.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:12.080]   Who knows, in course of time the competition might be too severe and the schools might go
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   into receivership. Ah, I thought so. There is one skill I had forgotten. When, as the result of some
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:26.880]   trips to Europe, of much prodding on my part, and of summers spent at the kind of summer camp that
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:34.160]   does not yet exist, I am eventually confronted with a son who can make onion soup like Savarin,
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:39.840]   ride a horse like an Indian, play a difficult sonata, speak French and German like a native,
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:46.720]   and repair a leak in the roof. Will not there be something missing? Yes, an accomplishment
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:55.760]   vitally necessary to an American. Unusual though this young man may be, he should not seem so.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:04.000]   For his own comfort, and for mine. Is not a parent's basic ambition for his child that he be
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:10.080]   very different from other people, yet manage to seem almost exactly like them?
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:19.840]   (This article titled "What the Young Man Should Know" by Robert Little was published in the
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.600]   March 1933 issue of Harper's Magazine.)
