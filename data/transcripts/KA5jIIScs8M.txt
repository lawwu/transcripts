[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.900]   We could talk a little bit about what I consider really the holy grail of the nervous system,
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.900]   which is neuroplasticity.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.140]   It's an incredible capacity of the nervous system to change its wiring, strengthen connections,
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.500]   weaken connections, maybe new neurons, but probably more strengthening and weakening
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.500]   of connections.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.280]   Nowadays, we hear a lot of excitement about so-called classical psychedelics like LSD
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.920]   and psilocybin, which do seem to "open plasticity."
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.800]   They do a bunch of other things too, but through the release of neuromodulators like serotonin
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.840]   and so forth.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.420]   How do you think about neuroplasticity?
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.400]   And more specifically, what do you think the potential for neuroplasticity is in the adult,
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:52.120]   so let's say older than 25-year-old brain, with or without machines being involved?
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.360]   Because in your role at Neuralink and as a neurosurgeon in other clinical settings, surely
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:06.080]   you are using machines and surely you've seen plasticity in the positive and negative direction.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.360]   What do you think about plasticity?
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.920]   What's possible there without machines?
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.400]   What's possible with machines?
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:21.020]   So as you mentioned or alluded to, the plasticity definitely goes down in older brains.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.480]   It is harder for older people to learn new things, to make radical changes in their behavior,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.420]   to kick habits that they've had for years.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.700]   Machines aren't the obvious answer, so implanted electrodes and computers aren't the obvious
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.760]   answer to increase plasticity necessarily, compared to drugs.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.960]   We already know that there are pharmacologics, some of the ones you mentioned, psychedelics,
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.320]   that have a broad impact on plasticity.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.740]   It's hard to know which area of the brain would be most potent as a stimulation target
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:04.800]   for an electrode to broadly juice plasticity compared to pharmacologic agents that we already
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.320]   know about.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   I think with plasticity, in general, you're talking about the entire brain.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:20.040]   You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way in their tendency to
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.760]   be rewirable, their tendency to be up or down weighted.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.920]   An electrical stimulation target in the brain necessarily has to be focused.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.980]   With a device like potentially Neuralinks, there might be a more broad ability to steer
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.120]   current to multiple targets with some degree of control, but you're never going to get
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:53.920]   that broad targetability with any electrodes that I can see coming in our lifetimes, say
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.740]   that would be coating the entire surface and depth of the brain the way that a drug can.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.160]   I think plasticity research will bear the most fruit when it focuses on pharmacologic
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160]   agents.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.200]   I wasn't expecting that answer, given that you're at Neuralink.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.440]   Then again, I think that all of us, me included, need to take a step back and realize that
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.120]   while we may think we know what is going on at Neuralink in terms of the specific goals
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.000]   and the general goals, and I certainly have in mind, I think most people have in mind
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.120]   a chip implanted in the brain or maybe even the peripheral nervous system that can give
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.180]   people super memories or some other augmented capacity.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.960]   We really don't know what you all are doing there.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.600]   For all we know, you guys are taking or administering psilocybin and combining that with stimulation.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   We really don't know.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.620]   I say this with a tone of excitement because I think that one of the things that's so exciting
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.480]   about the different endeavors that Elon has really spearheaded, SpaceX, Tesla, et cetera,
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.720]   is that early on, there's a lot of mystique.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.720]   Mystique is a quality that is not often talked about, but it's I think a very exciting time
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.060]   in which engineers are starting to toss up big problems and go for it.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.000]   Obviously, Elon is certainly among the best, if not the best, in terms of going really
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   big.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.920]   I mean, Mars seems pretty far to me.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.400]   Electric cars all over the road nowadays are very different than the picture a few years
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.920]   ago when you didn't see so many of them, rockets and so forth, and now the brain.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.040]   To the extent that you are allowed, could you share with us what your vision for the
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.880]   missions at Neuralink are and what the general scope of missions are?
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.360]   Then if possible, share with us some of the more specific goals.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.880]   I can imagine basic goals of trying to understand the brain and augment the brain.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.320]   I could imagine clinical goals of trying to repair things in humans that are suffering
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.800]   in some way, or animals for that matter.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.840]   It's funny what you mentioned.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.440]   Neuralink, and I think Tesla and SpaceX before it, end up being these blank canvases that
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.600]   people project their hopes and fears onto.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.120]   We experience a lot of upside in this.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.160]   People assume that we have superpowers in our ability to alter the way brains work,
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.560]   and people have terrifying fears of the horrible things we're going to do.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.720]   For the most part, those extremes are not true.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.420]   We are making a neural implant.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:48.360]   We have a robotic insertion device that helps place tiny electrodes, smaller than the size
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.160]   of a human hair, all throughout a small region of the brain.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.720]   In the first indication that we're aiming at, we are hoping to implant a series of these
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.400]   electrodes into the brains of people that have had a bad spinal cord injury.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.200]   People that are essentially quadriplegic, they have perfect brains, but they can't use
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.400]   them to move their body.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.720]   They can't move their arms or legs.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.040]   Because of some high level spinal cord damage.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.040]   Exactly right.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.000]   And so this pristine motor cortex up in their brain is completely capable of operating a
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   human body.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.920]   It's just not wired properly any longer to a human's arms or legs.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:38.120]   And so our goal is to place this implant into a motor cortex and have that person be able
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.440]   to then control a computer.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.720]   So a mouse and a keyboard, as if they had their hands on a mouse and a keyboard, even
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.320]   though they aren't moving their hands, their motor intentions are coming directly out of
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.600]   the brain into the device.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.640]   And so they're able to regain their digital freedom and connect with the world through
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.260]   the internet.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.740]   Why use robotics to insert these chips?
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.940]   And the reason I ask that is that sure, I can imagine that a robot could be more precise
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.220]   or less precise, but in theory, more precise than the human hand.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.020]   No tremor, for instance.
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:28.860]   More precision in terms of maybe even a little micro-detection device on the tip of the blade
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.020]   or something that could detect a capillary that you would want to avoid and swerve around
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.260]   that the human eye couldn't detect.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:41.540]   And you and I both know, however, that no two brains nor are the two sides of the same
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.060]   brain identical.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:50.420]   So navigating through the brain is perhaps best carried out by a human.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:58.340]   However, and here I'm going to interrupt myself again and say, 10 years ago, face recognition
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:04.140]   was very clearly performed better by humans than machines.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.340]   And I think now machines do it better.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.860]   So is this the idea that eventually, or maybe even now, robots are better surgeons than
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.740]   humans are?
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.260]   In this limited case, yes.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.980]   These electrodes are so tiny and the blood vessels on the surface of the brain so numerous
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.980]   and so densely packed that a human physically can't do this.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:33.940]   A human hand is not steady enough to grab this couple micron width loop at the end of
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:41.460]   our electrode thread and place it accurately, blindly, by the way, into the cortical surface
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.300]   accurately enough at the right depth to get through all the cortical layers that we want
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.540]   to reach.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:57.900]   And I would love if human surgeons were essential to this process, but very soon humans run
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.120]   out of motor skills sufficient to do this job.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:09.580]   And so we are required in this case to lean on robots to do this incredibly precise, incredibly
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:15.640]   fast, incredibly numerous placement of electrodes into the right area of the brain.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.420]   So in some ways, Neuralink is pioneering the development of robotic surgeons as much as
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:26.100]   it's pioneering the exploration and augmentation and treatment of human brain conditions.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.100]   Right.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:33.340]   So as the device exists currently, as we're submitting it to the FDA, it is only for the
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.440]   placement of the electrodes.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.680]   The robot is part of the surgery.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.380]   I or another neurosurgeon still needs to do the, you know, the more crude part of opening
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:48.600]   the skin and skull and presenting the robot a pristine brain surface to sew electrodes
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   into.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.640]   Well, surely getting quadriplegics to be able to move again, or maybe even to walk again
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:03.900]   is a heroic goal and one that I think everyone would agree would be wonderful to accomplish.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:12.320]   Is that the first goal because it's hard, but doable, or is that the first goal because
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:18.860]   you and Elon and other folks at Neuralink have a passion for getting paralyzed people
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.860]   to move again?
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.840]   You know, broadly speaking, you know, the mission of Neuralink is to reduce human suffering,
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.940]   at least in the near term.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:33.380]   You know, there's hope that eventually there's a use here that makes sense for a brain interface
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:41.900]   to bring AI as a tool embedded in the brain that a human can use to augment their capabilities.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:48.540]   I think that's pretty far down the road for us, but definitely on a desired roadmap.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.800]   In the near term, we really are focused on people with terrible medical problems that
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.680]   have no options right now.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:04.920]   With regard to motor control, you know, our mutual friend recently departed, Krishna Shenoy,
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.720]   was a giant in this field of motor prosthesis.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:15.080]   It just so happens that his work was foundational for a lot of people that work in this area,
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.080]   including us.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.560]   And he was an advisor to Neuralink.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.560]   That work was farther along than most other work for addressing any function that lives
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.720]   on the surface of the brain.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.320]   The physical constraints of our approach require us currently to focus on only surface features
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.500]   on the brain.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:43.000]   So we can't say, go to the really very compelling surface, deep depth functions that happen
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.480]   in the brain, like, you know, mood, appetite, addiction, pain, sleep.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.640]   We'd love to get to that place eventually, but in the immediate future, our first indication
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.680]   or two or three will probably be brain surface functions like motor control.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:10.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
