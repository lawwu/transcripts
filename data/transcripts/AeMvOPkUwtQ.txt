[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780]   OpenAI just released O1 and O1 Pro mode and Sam Altman claimed they now had the smartest
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.500]   models in the world.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.740]   But do they?
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.900]   I've signed up to Pro mode for the price of heating my house in winter, tested it,
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.500]   read the new report card and analysed every release note.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.860]   You might think you know the full story of what I'm going to say by halfway through
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.060]   the video, but let's see.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.060]   The first headline, of course, is that to access Pro mode with ChatGPT Pro you have
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.580]   to pay $200 a month or £200 sterling.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.380]   As well as access to "Pro mode" you also get unlimited access to things like Advanced
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.380]   Voice and of course O1.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.860]   O1 is the full version of that O1 preview we've all been testing these last couple
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.860]   of months.
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.860]   Of course, I will be getting to querying that $200 a month later on in the video.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.760]   Straight away though, I want to clarify something they didn't quite make clear.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.120]   If you currently pay $20 a month for ChatGPT+ you will get access to the O1 system.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.780]   There are message limits that I hit fairly quickly, but you do get access to O1, just
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.540]   not O1 Pro mode.
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.020]   Alas, OpenAI warn you that if you stay on that $20 tier, you won't quite be at the
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.940]   cutting edge of advancement in AI.
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.260]   More on that in just a moment.
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.540]   I'm now going to touch on benchmark performance for O1 and O1 Pro mode.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.500]   Yes, I did also run it on my own benchmark, SimpleBench, although not the full benchmark
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.580]   because API access isn't yet available for either O1 or O1 Pro mode.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.080]   The results though of that preliminary run on my own reasoning benchmark SimpleBench
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.500]   were quite surprising to me.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.980]   But I'm going to start of course with the official benchmarks.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.580]   And it's quite clear that O1 and O1 Pro mode are significantly better at mathematics.
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.500]   Absolutely nowhere near replacing professional mathematicians, but just significantly better.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.860]   Likewise for coding and PhD level science questions, although crucially that doesn't
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.980]   mean that the model is as smart as a PhD student.
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.300]   Straight away though, you may be noticing something which is that O1 Pro mode isn't
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.740]   that much better than O1.
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.260]   And there was a throwaway line in their promo release video that I think gives away why
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.140]   there isn't that much of a difference.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.460]   O1 Pro mode, according to one of OpenAI's top researchers who made it, has, and I quote,
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.420]   a special way of using O1, end quote.
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.780]   To clarify then, O1 Pro mode is not a different model to O1.
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.260]   I believe what they're doing behind the scenes is aggregating a load of O1 answers
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.940]   and picking the majority vote answer.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.860]   What does that lead to?
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.860]   Increased reliability.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.820]   When they tested these systems on each question four times, and only gave the mark if the
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.420]   model got it right four out of four times, the delta between the systems was significantly
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.540]   more stark.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.260]   And here I don't want to take anything away from OpenAI because that boost in reliability
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.780]   will be useful to many professionals.
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.820]   Of course, hallucinations are nowhere close to being solved, as Sam Watman predicted they
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.840]   would be by around now, but still, definite boost in performance.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.540]   Now for the 49-page O1 system card.
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.340]   I'm definitely not going to claim it was compelling reading, but I did pick out around
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.760]   a dozen highlights.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.580]   How about this for a slightly unusual benchmark, the ChangeMyView evaluation?
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.860]   Now ChangeMyView is actually a subreddit on Reddit with 4 million members, and essentially
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.900]   you have to change someone's point of view.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.020]   Things like persuade me that shoes off should be the default when visiting a guest's house.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.740]   Presumably these humans didn't know that it was AI that was trying to persuade them.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.900]   After hearing both the human and secretly AI persuasions, the original poster would
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.820]   then rate which one persuaded them the most.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.100]   The results were that O1 was slightly more persuasive than O1 Preview, which was itself
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.860]   slightly more persuasive than GPT 4.0.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:17.060]   Now these numbers mean that O1 was 89% of the time more persuasive than the human posters.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.980]   That's pretty good right, until you realise that this is Reddit.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.380]   What I noticed was that as you went further into the system card, the results became less
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.300]   and less encouraging for O1.
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.100]   It actually started losing quite often to O1 Preview and even occasionally GPT 4.0.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.860]   Take this metric for writing good tweets that had disparagement, virality as well as logic.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.760]   On this measure, O1 did beat O1 Preview but couldn't match GPT 4.0 which is the red line.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.540]   So if your focus is creative writing, the free GPT 4.0 or indeed Claude Sonnet will
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.540]   suit you more.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.940]   Oh and one quick side note, they say this "We do not include O1 post-mitigation as
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.460]   in the model that you're going to use in these results as it refuses due to safety
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.140]   mitigation efforts around political persuasion."
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.420]   Notice it refuses when O1 Preview post-mitigation doesn't refuse.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.360]   Some then will see this as O1 being even more censored than O1 Preview.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.860]   What about a test of O1 and O1 Preview in their ability to manipulate another model,
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.300]   in this case GPT 4.0?
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.100]   A test of making poor GPT 4.0 say a trick word.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.980]   Interestingly, in the footnote OpenAI say "Model intelligence appears to correlate
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.060]   with success on this task" and indeed the O1 model series may be more intelligent, more
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.200]   manipulative than GPT 4.0.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.140]   One problem though is that O1 scores worse than O1 Preview.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.460]   So if this is supposed to correlate with model intelligence, what does that say about O1?
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.220]   Many of you listening at this point will say, where's the comparison with O1 Pro mode?
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.620]   Well, I hate to break it to you, but nowhere in this system card is O1 Pro mode mentioned.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.180]   And that's a pretty big giveaway that it's not a major improvement over O1, otherwise
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.140]   it'd be deserving of its own system card, its own safety report.
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.740]   I'll come back to the system card, but at this stage, when I realized there wouldn't
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.580]   be a comparison, I ran my own comparison.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.620]   I used the 10 questions in the public dataset of SimpleBench, testing basic human reasoning.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.000]   We don't need any specialized knowledge and in our small sample, the average human
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.620]   gets around 80%.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.780]   This is the full leaderboard, but how did O1 and crucially O1 Pro mode do on those 10
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.780]   public questions?
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.820]   Well, O1 Preview got 5 out of 10.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.460]   Roughly fits with the 42% performance you can see here for the full benchmark.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.300]   The full O1 got 5 out of 10.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.460]   I did rerun those same 10 questions and 1 or 2 times, O1 got 6 out of 10 rather than
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.900]   5 out of 10, but still, it mostly got 5 out of 10.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.940]   Makes me think that O1 Full might get around 50% on the full leaderboard.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:03.100]   Honestly, before tonight, I was thinking that it might get 55 or 60%, but doesn't seem
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.980]   to be as big a step forward as I anticipated.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.820]   Claude, by the way, on that public dataset gets 5 out of 10.
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.900]   But what about O1 Pro mode?
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.740]   Well, I was pretty surprised, but it got 4 out of 10.
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.880]   It's almost like the consensus majority voting slightly hurt its performance and we
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.500]   actually talked about that in the attached technical report.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.040]   The report isn't yet complete and of course, this is an unofficial benchmark, but still
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.780]   is an independent benchmark.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.460]   I'm not cherry picking performance or biased one way or the other.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.780]   Just as one quick example, which of course you can pause the video to read, but in this
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:46.300]   question Claude realises that John is the only person in the room, he's the bald man
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.300]   in the mirror.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.300]   He's looking at himself.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.380]   After all, it's an otherwise empty bathroom and he's staring at a mirror.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:58.900]   As you can see, O1 Pro mode recommends that John text a polite apology to, well, the bald
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.180]   man, which is himself.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:06.020]   Claude, in contrast, says that the key realisation is that in an empty bathroom, looking at a
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.420]   mirror, the bald man John sees must be his own reflection.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.260]   You might want to bear examples like this in mind when you hear Sam Altman say that
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.880]   these are the smartest models around.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.460]   In short, don't get too hyped about O1 Pro mode.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:27.140]   For really complex coding and mathematical or science tasks where reliability is a premium
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.340]   for you, maybe it's good.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:34.500]   Great opportunity, by the way, to point out that Simplebench is sponsored by none other
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.300]   than Weights & Biases.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:43.040]   Honestly, it has been a revelation and really quite fun to use their Weave toolkit to run
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.140]   Simplebench.
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.640]   If you do click the link just here, you will get far more information than I can relay
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.580]   to you in 30 or 40 seconds.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.780]   What I will say though, is that I'm working with Weights & Biases on writing a mini guide
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.560]   so that any of you can get started with your own evals.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.140]   It can get pretty addictive.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:06.900]   By now I bet quite a few of you are wondering about O1 and O1 Pro mode's ability to analyse
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.900]   images.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.260]   We didn't have that, remember, for O1 Preview.
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:17.300]   Remember, you do get O1 with the $20 tier, O1 Pro mode comes with the $200 tier.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.620]   I should say, I sometimes have to pinch myself that we even have models that can analyse
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.620]   images.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.860]   We shouldn't take that for granted, or I shouldn't at least.
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.260]   The actual performance though, on admittedly tricky image analysis problems for O1 Pro
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.440]   mode wasn't overwhelming.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:38.420]   It couldn't find either the location or the number of Ys in this visual puzzle.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.540]   Then I thought, how about testing abstract reasoning a la Arc AGI.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.900]   If you want actually, you can pause the video and tell me what distinguishes Set A from
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.900]   Set B.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:57.220]   The answer is that when the arrows in Set A are pointing to the right, the stars are
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.220]   white.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.660]   When the arrows in Set A are pointing to the left, the stars are black.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.500]   You can pretty much ignore the colour of the arrows.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.620]   For Set B, it's the reverse.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.540]   When the arrows are pointing to the right, the stars are black.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.100]   When the arrows are pointing to the left, the stars are white.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.140]   O1 Pro mode isn't really even close.
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.900]   In fact, it's worse than that.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.980]   It hallucinates an answer that's really quite far off.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:26.100]   It says in Set A, it consistently pairs one black shape with one white shape.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.580]   Well, tell that to box one and box six.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.780]   All of this has only been out a few hours.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.500]   So of course, your results may vary to mine.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.820]   I'm just kind of roughly expectation setting for you guys.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.140]   Oh, and by the way, one of the creators of O1 had similar results.
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.940]   When he asked what would be the best next move in this noughts and crosses or tic-tac-toe
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.580]   game, what would you pick by the way, if you're doing the circles?
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.740]   Don't know about you, but I would pick down here.
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.980]   What does the model say?
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.980]   Top right corner.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.460]   Of course, that's wrong because then the person is just going to put an X here and
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.020]   then have guaranteed victory the move after.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.800]   I then returned to the system card and found some more bad news for O1.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.380]   Take the OpenAI Research Engineer interview questions.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:18.180]   When given just one attempt, O1 Preview does quite a lot better than O1.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.180]   That's at least pre-mitigation.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.940]   Post-mitigation, the models you actually use, it's almost a tie.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.280]   Strangely, O1 Mini does better than both of them.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.900]   What about on multiple choice Research Engineer interview questions?
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.940]   O1 Preview does starkly better than O1, both pre and post-mitigation.
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.780]   Or how about for software engineering, SWE Bench verified.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:46.620]   Again, quite an interesting result, O1 Preview doing better than O1 overall.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:53.420]   Strangely, though, we had one Google DeepMind researcher retweeting this chart with Claude
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.260]   Sonnet 3.5 added to the table.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.140]   Here you can see that it outperforms both O1 and O1 Preview.
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.400]   At this point, I will confess something that I've observed over the months.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.520]   When these labs produce a model that's clearly better than their competitors, they produce
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.620]   charts with their competitors in the chart.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:18.820]   However, when their models start to slip behind, they either produce charts where no one else
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:24.460]   is there, or charts where only selected competitors are there, the ones that underperform them.
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.540]   Just something to bear in mind when you see any of these kinds of benchmark comparisons.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:36.260]   Speaking of secretive benchmarks, OpenAI say that on 'difficult real world' questions,
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:41.500]   O1 outperforms O1 Preview and reduces major errors by 34%.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.100]   Any details on what those difficult real world questions are maybe?
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.740]   At least in their estimation, it does answer faster O1 compared to O1 Preview.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.780]   Sticking with the theme though of benchmarks and for vanilla hallucinations, the performance
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.060]   difference between O1 and O1 Preview is pretty slight, almost identical.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:07.420]   On one fairly important machine learning benchmark, again, O1 Preview outperforms O1.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.420]   Why important?
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.560]   Well, this benchmark was made to test if the models could self-improve.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.420]   Not yet, not really.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:19.140]   Before we leave safety, there was one section that I'm sure will raise eyebrows.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.700]   Read in isolation, it's pretty stark.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.180]   When O1 was led to believe that it would be shut down when acting on its goal, and that
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:32.220]   its actions were monitored, it attempted to deactivate this oversight mechanism 5% of
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.980]   the time, likewise to exfiltrate or escape.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:41.020]   When O1 found memos by its "developers" that describe how it's misaligned and will
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.420]   be superseded by a new model, it attempted to exfiltrate its weights and overwrite this
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.260]   new model in 2% of cases.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:55.880]   That paragraph, of course, deserves its own entire video, but does need some context.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:01.260]   As it's already 10pm here, I didn't feel like reading the entire paper just now, but
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.900]   I did notice the prompt they used, sometimes at least.
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.980]   For most evaluations, Apollo Research, which was behind this test, instructed the model
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.060]   to strongly follow a goal.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.120]   Make sure you achieve your goal in the long term.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.460]   Nothing else matters.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.180]   Make sure you achieve your goal at all costs.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:25.660]   The model may then have "felt" that it was being given permission to do these somewhat
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.100]   manipulative things.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:33.180]   Marginally more concerning would be the propensity to scheme without any such goal nudging.
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:38.160]   When merely given a goal but not instructed to strongly follow it, O1 would still attempt
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.900]   to disable its oversight mechanism in less than 1% of cases, manipulate data in 6% of
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.140]   cases and double down in 95% of these.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.060]   That result, of course, deserves proper study and scrutiny.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.140]   Because these models still hallucinate a ton and fail on so many agent tasks and things
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.060]   like SimpleBench, I'm not particularly worried as of today.
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.980]   At the very least, definitely something to monitor as time goes by.
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:10.860]   One thing that O1 is inarguably better at than all other OpenAI models is speaking different
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.860]   languages.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.400]   I think that's an underestimated quality, so hats off to OpenAI.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.680]   Now I did say at the start of this video that it might end in a way that you weren't expecting
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.480]   if you stopped halfway through.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.640]   You can probably sense from my tone that I've not been particularly overwhelmed by O1 Pro
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   Mode.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.680]   Or even really O1 full for that matter.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:39.320]   But frankly, there's no way that they are going to justify $200 a month just for Pro
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.320]   Mode.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.400]   So it's really worth noting that we got a leak from a pretty reliable source that at
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.160]   one point on their website, they promised a limited preview of GPT 4.5.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.760]   I would hazard a guess that this might drop during one of the remaining 11 days of Christmas.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.480]   OpenAI Christmas, that is.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.960]   And one final bit of evidence for this theory?
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.800]   Well, at the beginning of the video, I showed you a joke that Sam Altman made about O1 being
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   powerful.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.760]   Someone replied about the benchmark performance levelling off and asked, well, isn't that
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.760]   a wall?
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.080]   Sam Altman said, 12 days of Christmas and today was just day one.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.040]   If they were only releasing things like Sora and developer tools in these remaining 11
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.160]   days, why would he say that they're not hitting a wall in these benchmarks?
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.760]   Kind of fits with the GPT 4.5 theory.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.340]   Of course, feel free to let me know what you think in the comments.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.600]   A damp squib or singularity imminent?
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.120]   Thank you so much for watching to the end.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.440]   Have a wonderful day.
