[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   This is my Twitter pitch meeting right here.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.360]   Hey guys, what if we made a web page, but designed it as a panic attack?
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.360]   That's what it is.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.460]   What if it's a web page?
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.080]   And as you look at it, a pneumatic arm comes out from your computer
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.080]   and just pure epinephrine just.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.160]   All right.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.880]   I'm Cal Newport.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.560]   I'm here with Jamie Kilstein for the very first installment in a new show.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.040]   We're trying that is called Cal and Jamie explain the internet.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.140]   I will briefly summarize the premise here.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.620]   And then Jamie, I'm going to ask you to try to explain to the audience
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.740]   why in the hell we would do this.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.680]   Here's the, here's the problem.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.640]   I'll be figuring it out while you talk right now.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.480]   You have like 30 seconds to figure this out.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.800]   Okay.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.080]   So, so the, uh, the very well thought through premise that everyone thinks
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.680]   is a good idea is that, uh, I'm someone who sort of famously has never
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.240]   had a social media account.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.520]   So I really often don't know what's going on in the world of the internet.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.320]   Jamie somewhat famously used to be a big user of social media, but as, uh, as
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.120]   many of his fans know, has been really trying hard in recent months and years
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.960]   to use that much less, which makes Jamie and I at this moment, two of the worst
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.120]   people in the world to try to explain to you trends on the internet.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.400]   So that is the premise of the show.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.880]   We had my intrepid podcast producer, Jesse pull a collection of five articles,
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.200]   videos, or tweets that are big on the internet in the last week.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.120]   He told me he was using Twitter trends, tech talk trends, and a program called
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.720]   tube buddy, which looks at what's trending on YouTube to try to figure out
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.320]   what are five things that normal internet users have almost certainly heard about.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.600]   Jamie and I almost certainly know very little about it, but we will still try
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.680]   nonetheless to explain to you what we think is going on or how we think people.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.960]   Reacting.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.360]   So Jamie, why are we doing this?
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.480]   Uh, well, we are doing this for a couple of reasons.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.800]   Number one, it's very funny to maybe only us.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.600]   Number two, nothing in our friendship makes me laugh harder than when I would
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.200]   try to explain to Cal, uh, like very online TM stuff where I'm like, Hey, did
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.960]   you read about Glenn Greenwald?
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.520]   And Cal's like, no, I have a family and I'm happy.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.560]   And I'm like, Oh, what's that like?
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.880]   And then, uh, so I think it'll be very fun.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.120]   I think it'll be very funny.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.120]   I also think for all of you listening, who have read cows work, listen to cows
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.920]   podcast, or trying to get off social media less.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.320]   Um, I think hearing some of the dumb stuff that we're probably going to cover, um,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.120]   may be the nail in the coffin and may solidify it for you.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.480]   And, uh, if not, maybe also maybe Cal and I can give some non tribalized echo
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.600]   chamber takes on important issues.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.280]   And maybe we'll accidentally stumble upon some really good stuff, uh, that
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.440]   you're not going to find on Twitter when everyone's just calling each other,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.320]   either a cuck or Nazi.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.600]   Uh, and then the final reason, uh, selfishly.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   I still have to be on social media to promote my podcast a little bit.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.760]   So I still post clips and stuff like that.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.120]   I don't get into fights anymore, but I eventually would like to move out into
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.560]   the woods, uh, with my girlfriend and never see a computer again.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.720]   So I'm hoping that whatever is trending on tick tock today or in future episodes,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.400]   uh, will drive me to become just, uh, just an armed, an armed father
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.800]   in the middle of the forest.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.080]   Uh, and not a Nazi.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.800]   Cuck, not a Nazi cock, not the worst kind of Nazis.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.200]   I cuckolded Nazis are the worst.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.120]   And you see, this is how, you know, I am a professor, not internet user.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.040]   I use the full term.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.920]   Cuckolded.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.760]   All right, Jamie, I'm loading.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.400]   Number one.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.200]   All right.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.600]   You will.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.480]   We have not seen these.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.920]   We have not seen any of these.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.760]   We took this very seriously.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.440]   Yes.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.240]   Took this very serious.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.520]   Okay.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.720]   I'm going to click on a button here.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.320]   We're going to share our first.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.240]   Our first thing that was trending on the internet in the last week.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.200]   Boom.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.760]   Share.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.120]   All right.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.840]   We see a headline.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.720]   Christopher Nolan recreated a nuclear weapon explosion without CGI.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.280]   Jamie, what do you think is going on here?
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.360]   Oh no.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.960]   Uh, whatever.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.920]   When I, I truly have not seen this.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.040]   Um, I have not seen this story without CGI.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.320]   Um, something dangerous.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.160]   Is it something dangerous?
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.560]   Did he blow up a city?
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.640]   I like, is that possible?
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.080]   I like the fact, I mean, this is the same year.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.920]   Alec Baldwin shot a lady, right?
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.880]   Like one with like one gun, he shot a lady and Christopher Nolan saw that.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.280]   And was like, you know what?
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.480]   I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to blow something up.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.160]   I see.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.640]   You think Christopher Nolan is big timing Alec Baldwin by murdering
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.680]   hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.200]   You know, this is probably the tamest story we're going to cover.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.680]   And I accidentally made our opening, probably the most
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.400]   offensive thing to come out.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.960]   You didn't say you were, you thought it was a good idea.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.760]   I think it's a very bad idea.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.280]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.160]   Yeah, to be clear, but also I think anything post dark night, uh, of
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.880]   Christopher Nolan has been kind of underwhelming anyway, I'm a moment.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.200]   Uh, not sound like a hipster.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.560]   I'm kind of a memento guy.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.720]   Oh, you're talking to someone who saw Dunkirk in a 70 millimeter projection.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.840]   So I'm going to argue about that.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   Uh, all right.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.080]   Before we reveal here though, let me just say two reasons why I like Chris Nolan.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.520]   Uh, number one, I had some articles somewhere that he doesn't use.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.440]   Like email, I think.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.960]   He has like an old flip.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.800]   He's one of these guys.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.080]   Like he's so focused on, I'm making these huge movies.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.760]   All my attention's on that.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.560]   I wrote an article about him a couple of years ago.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.200]   You're so true to brand.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.440]   Well, the more of a hermit, this guy, someone is the more you're like, I'm in baby.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.880]   Uh, and also he got really mad.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.920]   I think he broke relations with Warner brothers when they started streaming.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.560]   All of their movie productions on HBO max while they're in the theaters.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.880]   And Nolan was like, I'm out of here.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.080]   So he's old school.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.960]   Let's be in a theater, not on a phone.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.440]   So I like him.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.720]   All right.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.640]   What's really going on here.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.840]   All right.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.360]   Here's to reveal.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.520]   I'll read this since this text might be small.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.760]   He recreated the first nuclear weapon detonation.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.160]   This is in his film Oppenheimer.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.920]   I did hear about that.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.640]   I'm a film geek about Robert Oppenheimer who ran the Manhattan
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.840]   project during world war II, the film.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.280]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.320]   Don't bury the lead here, guys.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.800]   They're talking about all the actors in this.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.520]   Uh, how did he do this explosion?
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.120]   Come on.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.960]   No one has always favored practical effects over VFX.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.680]   He blew up a real Boeing seven 47 for tenant respect.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.640]   So it's no, uh, the bad news was it was, uh, an active Delta flight, but
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.720]   you know, you gotta do what you gotta do.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.240]   Hey man, it's all for the art for the art.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.280]   Uh, it's that's why he doesn't have email or social media.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.640]   So he can't be held accountable.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.400]   Exactly.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.240]   He doesn't want to hear the trolls who are going to prioritize.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.800]   You killed a Delta flight of passengers.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.040]   Like I'm doing art, baby.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.480]   Um, so he said it'd be in the commenter.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.080]   Oh man, there's so much texture.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.120]   So how did he do this?
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.760]   Uh, blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.200]   I don't know.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.560]   It looks like he just blew up a big bomb.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.920]   Were people mad?
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.160]   I think what eventually we'll get to when we start getting these stories sent to us
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160]   is like, I want to see people's reactions.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.720]   Right.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.800]   Um, there are zero comments on this article.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.120]   All right.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.600]   This, so this is, this is a, this is an example I think of good internet, you
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.240]   know, where it's, here's like a quirky, interesting thing that you probably
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.360]   wouldn't have heard about, but if you're an internet user, you might've come across
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.040]   this, this was trending on YouTube or something.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.960]   You'd be like, oh, that's cool.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.240]   He like made a big explosion.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.440]   It looks like a nuclear bomb.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.960]   Uh, I'm, I'm giving this a sort of good internet thumbs up.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.400]   I think this is good internet.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   And this is going to be the difference between me and Cal as well is I am so
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:55.240]   used to, um, I'm so used to bad internet that I think I jumped in and made my
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.600]   little, made my little offensive joke just preparing.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.320]   So for example, I'm on a text thread right now.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:07.840]   That the beloved movie, the whale, Brendan Fraser's like, you know, resurgence,
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.800]   staining ovation at all the film festivals, I guess Roxanne Gay wrote an
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   angry, uh, wrote a piece about it because something about fat people.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.120]   And, um, so I'm very used to, as I was part of back in the day, like 10 years
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.360]   ago, I'm very used to outrage culture.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.760]   So when I see something that you might rate as good, oh, what a cool, what a
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.440]   cool thing for a filmmaker to do.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.400]   I'm just waiting for like my old friends to be like, this is offensive to bombs.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.840]   And I'm like, I don't get it.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.720]   Nice beard, Nolan.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.200]   You have a problem with faces.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:42.840]   Yeah, I get it.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.160]   So you're, you're locked in.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.440]   You're locked in on.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.320]   All right.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.480]   I think this next one.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.720]   I have it loaded here.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.800]   This is a trending Twitter thread.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.840]   So I think here we're going to maybe leave good internet.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.400]   So let's see, I'm going to go back to share.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.600]   Go back to share.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.000]   I click on it.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.720]   Here we go.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.840]   We need theme songs for leaving good internet.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.280]   Like just like a kind of cryptic, like rowing down the haunted
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.960]   river, kind of old Disney, uh, theme.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.120]   Oh, it's, it's my buddy, Barry Weiss.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.200]   This will definitely be bad.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:14.800]   All right.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.360]   Let's see here.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:21.000]   Thread the Twitter files, part two, Twitter's secret backlist.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.880]   All right.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.320]   Well, Jamie, you know, Barry, do you already know this story or
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   are you, are you looking at this?
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.760]   I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.280]   This is new Jamie.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.920]   Old Jamie would have had so many takes on it.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.080]   New Jamie looked at that.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.280]   It's something she's doing with journalist, Matt Taibbi, who
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.480]   I've also known for a while.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.720]   And I just kind of go good for them.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.360]   And then I click out of it.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:49.360]   Um, I saw some people on both sides being outraged and I, I barely dude.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.400]   I mean, this is probably one of the biggest stories right now, period.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.440]   And I have just like, I've I'm rewatching Jack Ryan since season three is coming
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.120]   out and just living my best life.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.880]   So I, I I've heard about, like, I know this is happening.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.480]   I know that that Elon Musk is, uh, releasing internal Twitter
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.200]   files to independent reporters.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.040]   So I know about that.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.680]   And I know that there's some stipulation that they have
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.080]   to post about it on Twitter.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.520]   I don't, I don't know a lot of the details.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.800]   Let's not read this whole thing, but here's number point.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.680]   Number one from this, right.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.960]   By the way, can I just say, I wrote an article about Twitter for this one.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.000]   I think it was for Wired magazine early in the pandemic.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:38.680]   And I made this point, this is such a terrible platform for any
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.720]   sort of complex information.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.680]   Like, look at this, let's put all content aside.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.640]   Look at the screen, this thread situation where you have like a couple of sentences
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.320]   and you have to link to another thing with a couple of sentences and number it.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.000]   It's like guys, websites exist, blogs exist.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.400]   There, there has to be some way.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.800]   Uh, it's crazy that this is like the number one way over the last three years,
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.240]   the complex information is, is yeah.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.920]   It's not like we haven't cracked the tech yet.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.640]   This is my Twitter pitch meeting right here.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.800]   Hey guys, what if we made a webpage, but designed it as a panic attack?
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.760]   That's what it is.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880]   What if it's a webpage?
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.520]   And as you look at it, a pneumatic arm comes out from your computer
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.040]   and just pure epinephrine.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.000]   Just, there we go.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:28.120]   Uh, well, and then on top of that, it's like the algorithms make
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.840]   it harder to see certain people.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.160]   And well, that's kind of what this is sort of about.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.680]   So read whatever part you want.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.040]   All right.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.760]   All right.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.520]   So here's number, I'll read the first couple tweets, which again, I have to
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.800]   jump from tweet to tweet to read this.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.520]   That's a tech issue.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.040]   All right.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.320]   A new Twitter files investigation reveals that teams of Twitter employees
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.040]   build blacklist, prevent disfavored tweets from twin trending and actively
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.960]   limit the visibility of entire accounts or even trending topics, all in a secret,
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.080]   all in secret without informing users.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.440]   Here's one example.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.520]   Take for example, Stanford's Dr.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.560]   J Bhattacharya.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.280]   I do know who that is because I was a COVID nerd early in COVID who argued that
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.800]   COVID lockdowns would harm children.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.920]   Twitter secretly placed him on a trends, a blacklist, which
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.120]   prevented his tweets from.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.720]   Trending.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:09.960]   All right.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.240]   So this is a, this is about secretly.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.560]   Whatever throttling people on Twitter.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.120]   Um, so what, what, all right.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.600]   That makes sense.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.320]   First of all, what's your take on it?
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.240]   Second of all, how do you think people reacted to this?
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.080]   I'm sure reasonably.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.080]   Yeah, it's a, it's all bad.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.880]   It's all bad.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.240]   All bad.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.080]   I think all of it, all of it's bad.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.720]   Um, well, what's funny is.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.880]   You know, there, there are a bunch of different like memes that go around
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.200]   about conspiracy theorists where it's like, Hey, we've been right, essentially
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.560]   the last couple of years, and I hate to admit it, right.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:50.200]   But there were a lot of people who were talking about shadow banning and soft
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.840]   banning and things like this.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.800]   And a lot of them were on the right.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.000]   And a lot of people on the left were calling them delusional,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.080]   calling them conspiracy, blah, blah, blah.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.120]   I'm definitely shadow banned on Instagram and I haven't posted a
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.640]   damn thing about the vaccine.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.800]   I'm just like mental health and dogs and comedy.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.360]   Um, and.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:17.480]   You know, that kind of get made fun of and what Barry and Ty Eby uncovered is
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.560]   like, no, there are actually memos from the government being like, Hey, like
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.320]   to Twitter to, you know, being like, Hey, check out this guy.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.760]   This is, you know, whatever.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.680]   And a lot of the things they were posting at the time.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.040]   I think that people thought were dangerous because we didn't know as
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.600]   much about COVID as we did now.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.640]   So it was a lot of like anti mask people.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.560]   It was people who were skeptical about the vaccine.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:47.320]   And, uh, and so they were just like, fucking shut it down.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.880]   Um, and yeah, I think that's bad.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.920]   I think that we should have access to all information and then we should be
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.520]   able to make decisions for ourself.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:01.200]   But my, what I would throw back to you though, is in the way social media
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.760]   works on our brains and the way tribalism works and these algorithm works.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.520]   Is, is that actually naive of me?
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.080]   And is it even possible to just, Hey, give us, give us information on
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.160]   both sides and we'll, we'll figure it out.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.720]   Like, where do you draw the line, I guess, um, for this kind of
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.520]   like soft banning shadow banning.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.520]   Which, which has happened to us.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:23.840]   I'm sure.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.920]   Like, why did everyone stop talking to me?
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.840]   Well, look, okay.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.360]   I have a, I have a, like a.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.560]   A small scale and big scale take on this.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.560]   I mean, small scale take, uh, if you're going to run one of these platforms,
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.040]   you're going to have to make these types of decisions, right?
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.680]   Like we've seen that, um, you look at 4chan, like 4chan had to start making
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.560]   some of those decisions, which led to 8chan, right?
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.520]   Like 8chan was people saying, uh, you cucks over at 4chan.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.800]   Am I using cucks right by the way?
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.280]   Is that right?
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:52.800]   Yeah, sure.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.040]   Dude, I know the Shakespearean reference.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.480]   So, so I don't know if this is right.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.920]   There's no wrong way to use that word.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.240]   It is the funniest.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:00.680]   All right.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.400]   So, so 4chan was just cucking along with a bunch of cucks
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.760]   and they had a cucking policy.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.720]   Um, but anyway, so you have to, you're going to have to do this, right?
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.160]   Like there's going to be, uh, there's going to be cases where like, we
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.400]   don't want this on our platform.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.880]   We just, we have advertisers, right.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.400]   Um, and then the, the dividing line is always going to be hazy.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.720]   So the fact that, so Twitter is based in San Francisco, that, I mean, the number
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.760]   I saw is that 99% of their employees, according to public records, voted
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.640]   Democrat in the last one percent is Elon Musk and the other one percent was Elon
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:32.840]   Musk.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.280]   Or I, I think they, they have, um, what's the name?
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.040]   Uh, Milo in a cage somewhere.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.760]   Is that the right name?
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.360]   My, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.320]   They kind of poke at them.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.080]   They, they put tweets in front of him and if he gets excited, they ban them.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.240]   I think that's the one.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.320]   But anyways, my, my point is, is like, okay.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.520]   Uh, so how do you avoid them in that situation?
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.200]   If you're internally making decisions to have an Overton window, that's going to
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.480]   be just farther towards the farther left, um, than rest of the country.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.160]   That seems unavoidable.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.640]   Uh, making moderation decisions are unavoidable.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.840]   I mean, I don't know any answer to that in the small scale beyond, and this is what
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.120]   I thought Elon should have done, but you know, it seems like he might be going
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.560]   crazy.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.560]   Uh, what he should have done was just said, yes, we have to make this moderation
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.200]   decisions.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.680]   Um, we're just going to balance out who's on these committees so that like that
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.320]   Overton window is roughly centered.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.960]   Like I, I said this in a podcast a couple of weeks ago.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.320]   Um, the standard should be, you know, if your mom would be kind of upset about
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.280]   something, and I don't mean your mom in particular, but just like millennials,
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.200]   moms, like people in their seventies, we have such like, okay, let's be, be worried
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.360]   about.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.880]   So like things where you would have to be like pretty up on sort of cutting edge
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.520]   political ideology to understand something is offensive.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.200]   Like that probably wouldn't fall into like a standard, like what ups and downs.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.600]   A couple of things real quick.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.080]   I think that one, the, um, I love you pointing out that Elon Musk is going crazy
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   because that means his billions of dollars, all the businesses he runs, that's not
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.920]   what made him crazy.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.120]   What made him crazy was a month on Twitter and he just fucking completely went like
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.960]   koohoo bananas.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.000]   That is by the way, that is exactly what, and this is.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.440]   I'm not talking out of school because this was during the episodes, what Sam
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.280]   Harris told me.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.760]   Sam knows Elon and in my recent appearance on Sam's podcast, he told me on air,
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.560]   uh, Twitter broke Elon's brain, but, but he, he actually says it's not him buying
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.400]   Twitter that broke his brain.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.280]   He bought Twitter because Twitter had broken his brain.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.560]   So he was so addicted to it.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.280]   That's why he bought Twitter.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.960]   He spent $40 billion.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.440]   It's, it's, you know, it's like chasing that pure Coke in the eighties or
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:28.640]   something.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.160]   Anyways, go on.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.520]   Do that's exactly what it is.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:36.000]   Uh, number two, I wanted to say that, I mean, the serious thing is, and I'm sure
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.240]   what's going to be great about this show is just like when, you know, you're
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.000]   listening to fucking two bears, one cave and they're like, what's that movie?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.480]   And the fans are like at home screaming the movie.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.200]   Like I know what it is.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.640]   People are screaming at us.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.040]   Like what is actually happening?
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.520]   Um, you know, where this became even more problematic is look, man, companies,
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.440]   private companies have the right to choose who uses their platform.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:05.680]   Um, where this got even crazier was the fact that there are memos from
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.800]   political administrations pretty much being like, Hey, get this guy, go get
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.840]   this guy, shadow ban this.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.880]   And now it's like, okay, well now the government is censoring voices and that's
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.520]   not good.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.200]   And then the most important thing I was going to say is, uh, uh, Jesse, if you're
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.600]   listening and we're looking for short clips to post, please cut a cow saying,
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.880]   uh, cuckoody, cut, cuck, or whatever, uh, that was, I wish I had the timestamps.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.360]   He's cutting as we speak.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.960]   So I'm going to cut a couple of those.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.040]   I'm going to cut a couple of those.
