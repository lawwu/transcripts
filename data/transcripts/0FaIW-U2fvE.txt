[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420]   All right, so one of the time management ideas I'm known for is time blocking.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.860]   This is where during your workday, you give every minute a job in advance.
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.040]   That is, you partition your available minutes into blocks and assign specific projects or
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.260]   tasks to those blocks.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.740]   I even produced a planner called the Time Block Planner to help implement this idea.
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.860]   Now last week, the writer Oliver Berkman, who I know and whose writing I really like
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.900]   and respect, in particular his breakthrough book, 4,000 Weeks, which is just fantastic,
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.300]   was talking about time blocking briefly on the podcast, Farewell.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.140]   By the way, a show you should also be listening to.
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.840]   I did an appearance on that not long ago talking about slow productivity.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.840]   Great show.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   Check that out.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.140]   Anyways, with great care intact, Berkman admitted that time blocking does not work that well
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.000]   for him, and in fact, he feels like it is a little oppressive.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   So who's right?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.980]   In today's deep dive, what I'm going to do is I will play the clip of Oliver talking
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.360]   about time blocking, and then I will give you my thoughts on it.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.700]   My conclusion might very well surprise you.
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.620]   All right, so let's hear what it is all the hubbub is about.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.620]   Let's see.
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.620]   Do we have a clip here?
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.620]   Can we play this, Jesse?
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.620]   All right, let's listen.
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.600]   "I will see you next hour," in a sort of meaningful way.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.780]   In the middle there is something like time boxing and time blocking.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.200]   I am, for the record, a huge fan of Cal Newport's work in all sorts of different areas, and
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.040]   his new book on slow productivity is absolutely fantastic.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.360]   But I'm looking forward to a conversation that I think we will have one day about time
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.620]   blocking and time boxing.
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.500]   I've found very often for me, like that is in this category of things that I think really
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.500]   help people.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.120]   I'm talking about where you sort of, you map out the day with what you're going to do in
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.140]   each period of hours.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.200]   And you know, maybe it's my personality, and maybe it's a bad personality, but for me,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.740]   that sort of almost all the time ends up feeling oppressive to a degree that just gets in the
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.020]   way of me being productive.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.920]   And I've learned the hard way, because it feels kind of indulgent or something, but
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.500]   I have learned that it is better for me to have some room in my approach to work to do
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.780]   what I feel like doing in a given moment.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.840]   Not just always, not just like who cares about deadlines or earning a living, I'll just do
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.580]   what I feel like, but to be able to harness that energy of like, oh, well, it's 2 p.m.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.900]   and I wasn't expecting to feel like this, but I'd really like to get stuck into that
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.900]   thing.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.900]   All right.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.740]   So we'll clip it there.
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.740]   So let me start.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.140]   I'll start with the end in mind.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.620]   I will start with my conclusion about all of this, and then we will work backwards to
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.100]   support why that's my conclusion.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.340]   There's two things I think are true at the same time right now.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.860]   Number one, Oliver Berkman is right about time blocking.
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.020]   Number two, time blocking is still really important.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.020]   All right.
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.700]   So let's unpack why both of these things are true at the same time.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.420]   I'll start with the first point.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.420]   Time blocking does feel oppressive, right?
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.380]   This is something that comes up often on this show where people eager about time blocking
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.260]   say, why not time block my time outside of work?
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.840]   Why not time block my weekend?
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.340]   I say, man, it is so, it's so demanding.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.780]   It's such a temporal taskmaster.
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.020]   You got to take a break from it.
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.500]   If you tried to time block your whole life, you're going to, you're going to burn out.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.580]   It really does have this sense of when you're working, you are locked in.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.380]   It is not a relaxed sensation because you have to, you're trying to stick with the blocks.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.380]   You want to hit the blocks.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.460]   There's a bit of urgency in there.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:04.060]   There's an act of will and resistance of the inertia deadening impulse to stop or do something
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.060]   else.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.060]   So it is, you feel it.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.260]   It could really exhaust you.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.980]   You have a bunch of long time block days in a row.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.980]   You feel it.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.980]   So Oliver is absolutely right about that.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.580]   It's not just his personality.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.380]   I think that's most people.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.380]   All right.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:23.700]   And second point, the approach Oliver mentions as an alternative, where you give some leeway
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.680]   to say, what do I feel like doing?
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.280]   Where is my energy level?
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.780]   What seems, you know, interesting or appropriate right now?
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.780]   That is more flexible.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.780]   It is probably more natural.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.760]   It is certainly something that's going to be more, it's going to feel better, right?
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.980]   Like that probably better fits the rhythms of humans as we've evolved over a long period
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.980]   of time.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.400]   And it's because it's difficult to predict in advance where your energy level is going
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.540]   to be at a certain time of the day.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.340]   What's going to be more appealing than something else, you know?
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.060]   And so it's to be able to say, this is what I feel well keyed to do, you know, that's
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.060]   going to feel more natural.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.980]   That is more flexible.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.900]   This requires a course, but I don't think it's a critique.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.180]   I think we just accept this.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.060]   This requires, of course, some level of self-awareness and resistance to procrastination, right?
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.180]   I mean, obviously, you have to be at a certain level of trust with your own work execution
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.340]   to just say, I'm going to see what I sort of feel like this afternoon and go with that.
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.340]   You have to have some trust.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.820]   You're not going to always just say, well, I feel like doing nothing.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.680]   But you know, people get there, right?
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.860]   So what he's talking about, that approach would be more natural.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.860]   It's also more relaxed.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.780]   You don't have that sense of urgency to it.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.260]   You feel like you have breathing room.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.220]   So those two points, I think are true, Oliver's right.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.380]   Time blocking is oppressive.
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.260]   Being more on the fly in deciding what to work on is more flexible, probably feels more
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260]   natural.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.220]   Point three, it is true at the same time that time blocking is brutally effective.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.700]   It is really, really effective.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:08.020]   The amount you get done in a time block day is on average 2X versus other approaches.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.740]   This is not an exact number, but sort of heuristically, I hear more or less this number again and
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.820]   again.
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.260]   It's part of the popularity of time blocking and the time block planner is, man, it is
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.260]   just effective.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.060]   A time block day ships stuff at a really high rate.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.540]   And there's various reasons for it.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.980]   One, there's less context switching, right?
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.820]   This is what I'm doing now until I'm done, then I'm doing this.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.900]   Non-time blockers, you're much more likely to shift back and forth between different
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.460]   things, especially when it comes to communication interruptions.
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.560]   Time blockers have blocks for it.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.540]   Non-time blockers just sort of have this as a background process going on.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.780]   What's going on with Slack?
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.780]   What's going on with email?
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.980]   And you have these constant context shifts, which reduces your cognitive capacity.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.980]   Batching is a good way to tackle things as well.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.900]   So I'm doing this for a 90 minute block.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.940]   It allows your brain to completely get the context, the cognitive context set on what
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.060]   you're doing, and now you're able to operate at a higher level of effectiveness.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.940]   It's a better use of your hours because you're looking ahead at the whole day.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.020]   So you're sort of seeing like, oh, this is going to be the best time to do this, where
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.760]   this time is good for this.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.100]   It's a more optimal assignment of time to activities than if you just sort of say, what
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.100]   am I doing now?
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.460]   You might realize as the day goes on, you know what?
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.420]   That morning block was probably the best time to do this thing.
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.660]   And I've missed it now because I wasn't thinking about it.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.500]   I just got started with my inbox or something like this.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.420]   It also leads to less energy being wasted on the persistent question of, should I keep
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.380]   working or should I take a break, right?
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.380]   You're not going to work all day.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.380]   You are going to take breaks.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.700]   When these breaks aren't scheduled, every minute is a potential opportunity to take
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.500]   a break or check your email or do something else, which means every minute you have to
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.700]   have this mental battle with yourself of, should I take a break now?
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.260]   Should I check my email now?
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.500]   You have to win that battle.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.060]   No, let's keep going.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.740]   The next minute that battle comes again.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.140]   When you're committed to time blocks, you don't have to fight this battle because there
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.140]   is no question.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.340]   This is what I'm doing for the next hour.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.340]   I'm checking my email then.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.460]   It's on here.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.540]   I'm not in that block.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.860]   So the only commitment you have to maintain is to sticking with your blocks as opposed
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.020]   to having to have an on-demand conversation and debate with yourself throughout the day.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.500]   All right, so we have these things true at the same time.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.100]   It's oppressive and not supernatural, a time block.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.780]   It also produces a huge amount of stuff.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.100]   So why do I preach it?
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.860]   Because so many modern knowledge work jobs have so overwhelmed us with work, and in particular,
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.660]   the administrative overhead that comes along with all of our work, that if we don't harness
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.060]   the brutal effectiveness of time blocking, we'll drown.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.020]   This is an unfortunate reality of many knowledge work jobs today, especially more office-style
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:54.940]   jobs in which you have uncontained work assignments when you have sort of uncontained back and
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.020]   forth conversations about work.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.760]   There's a sort of ad hoc freneticism to it.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.180]   Time blocking gives you a fighting chance of sort of being able to do a shutdown at
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.460]   the end of the day and sort of keep your head above water.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.460]   All right.
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.460]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.600]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:20.060]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.500]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.860]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.680]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.680]   Check it out.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.620]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:43.520]   So I want us to get to a world in which Oliver's approach can be much more widely applied into
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.000]   many more jobs because it's more natural, it's less exhausting and oppressive.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.040]   In our current world, however, we have to go with the brutally effective technique to
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.100]   make sure that we don't completely drown, that we're not up all throughout the evening
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.760]   having to try to catch up on emails.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.040]   We don't have to get up at 4 a.m. to get the work done because nothing could get done during
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.040]   the day.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.400]   So it's sort of a necessary compromise.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.520]   I won't say necessary evil, but sort of a necessary compromise.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.520]   All right.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.840]   So why do we get to this place?
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:15.320]   If we want to solve work, and now we have this alternative definition of solving work
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.560]   where we don't need something like time blocking anymore.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.640]   If we want to solve work, we have to understand where the problem came from.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.280]   Well, this is what I get into deeply in my new book, Slow Productivity, the whole first
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.360]   part of the book is sort of understanding what went wrong with knowledge work, right?
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.760]   And the key idea from that book that I think explains why we unfortunately still need time
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.160]   blocking was the lack of any sort of consistent workload management philosophy in most knowledge
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.840]   work sectors.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.540]   In most knowledge work jobs, there is no consistent agreed upon way to keep track of workload.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.680]   How much are you working on?
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.680]   What are you working on?
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.200]   How much should you be working on?
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.240]   Where is the work that needs to be done that no one is working on right now?
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.280]   We don't do this in most knowledge work settings.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.280]   We just throw work at people through email meetings and chats, and it just gets on your
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.360]   plate.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.560]   No one knows how much you're working on or how much that person's working on.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.400]   It's all uncontrolled.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.360]   And this leads to overload.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.080]   And the reason why the overload is a problem is not only is it hard to make progress on
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.160]   10 things at the same time, but each of those 10 things brings with it administrative overhead,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.880]   emails, meetings, and conversations needed to keep that task rolling.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.040]   This administrative overhead begins to pile up until most of your day now becomes stuck
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.700]   trying to service these different tasks.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.400]   You're trying to then desperate to find any time that's left to actually make progress
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.920]   on the tasks themselves.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.520]   This is the environment we're in.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.680]   It's caused by lack of consistent workload management philosophies.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.120]   It's an environment in which you have to like a general, unfortunately, but like a general
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.280]   plan your strategy for each day to try to keep the forces of email and meetings at bay
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.280]   enough so that your pincer move to get progress on this report actually succeeds.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.360]   It's a metaphorically war out there because of this overload epidemic and time blocking
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.160]   right now is sort of the best weapon that we have.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160]   So what is the solution?
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.520]   I mean, okay, slow productivity gets into this, but at the core of the solution is we
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.920]   have to fix this workload management problem.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.880]   Your team, your organization, yourself, if you're a freelancer entrepreneur, needs an
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:27.360]   agreed upon rational way to manage who's working on what, how much they should be working on,
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.000]   and how you keep track of things that need to be done that no one is working on in particular.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.340]   This means probably you have to have some sort of centralized list of work that is waiting
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.680]   to be worked on.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.720]   If you're a team, you have this all on a shared document or a board somewhere.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.400]   If you're an individual, do the same thing.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.740]   Here's things I'm not working on yet, but I've agreed to work on.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.000]   We need some way of keeping track of the active things.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.360]   What are the two things you're working on right now?
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.760]   What are the three things you're working on?
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.760]   This should be visible.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.760]   This should be transparent.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.000]   This should be public.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.880]   And then we need really smart limits to what the right amount of work to do concurrently
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   should be.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.080]   And it's probably two or three things of any non-trivial size at a time.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.140]   We can add all sorts of other, and I get into this in the book, we can add all sorts of
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.120]   other minutiae here.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.760]   Some things aren't discrete tasks, but are more, we could think of them as ongoing or
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.920]   service oriented.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.940]   Can you serve on this committee?
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.000]   Can you be in charge of the birthdays for the office?
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.960]   Can you be in charge of making sure the website stays up to date with client testimonials?
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.120]   We need a limit for ongoing service obligations like this as well.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.280]   Yeah, you should have like two of those and two major projects you're working on, and
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.280]   that's it.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.840]   When you finish a project, we pull another one in and we can all decide what makes sense.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.160]   We need these types of systems so that we're not overloaded.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.860]   If you're not overloaded, now you got some breathing room.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.440]   And now something like Oliver's method might make some sense.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.600]   All right, which of these do I want to work on today?
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   You know what?
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.600]   I should think I'm going to work on this one.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.760]   Actually, I'm going to kind of take it easy today.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.120]   You have this breathing room in your schedule where you can have your work follow the more
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.980]   natural ebbs and flows of both your energies and your interests, and it seems less oppressive.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.920]   It seems less like you're ending each workday out of breath.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:12.920]   In fact, I say, this is rough, but I have this prediction claim, let's say, that really
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.120]   the optimal type of workday and knowledge work would be one in which about 30% of your
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:24.240]   time is flex, that you could consistently do nothing for 30% of your day in aggregate
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.600]   and everything would be fine.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.040]   That's about the amount of flex you need.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.880]   Like some days you're feeling more of that.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.120]   Some days you're doing less of that.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.880]   You can shift around where work happens.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.160]   Work can take longer than you thought.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.720]   A 30% buffer, rather, is probably where we should be.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.880]   We'll never get there without more systematic ways of thinking about workload management.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:48.120]   All right, so returning to the original debate, in air quotes, between me and Oliver, there's
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.440]   really no debate at all.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.200]   He's right that time blocking is oppressive.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.680]   He is right that it'd be much nicer to be able to let your work to unfold more naturally.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.440]   The problem is, how do we get there?
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.000]   That's where the ideas I just talked about might help.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.720]   Read a book like Slow Productivity to get a better diagnosis of the problem and solutions.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:13.960]   Read Oliver's fantastic book, 4,000 Weeks, to get a better understanding of why his more
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.680]   natural method is where we want to get to, why that's more natural.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.520]   But in the meantime, while we're working towards these solutions, time blocking is probably
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.680]   what's going to work day to day.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   So it's interesting, Jesse.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.000]   It's like I've created a tool and now all of the rest of my work is trying to make that
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   tool obsolete.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.440]   There's like a weird energy, like I put out that planner and then my Slow Productivity,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.120]   the next book I published, if those ideas were put into practice, the planner would
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.160]   become obsolete.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.520]   So it's like I want to make that part of my advice not needed anymore.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.920]   There's a lot of things I give that are like that.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.760]   I have a lot of advice in time management organization where I say, I wish we didn't
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.640]   need to do this.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.240]   And if we fix knowledge work, we wouldn't have to.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:04.120]   But in the meantime, we got to run our lives like we're, you know, uh, in the mission control
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.120]   of the Apollo missions.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.600]   Like there's just so we got to keep track of this information.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.440]   We got to keep it around, you know, not because I wonder if this is why sometimes productivity
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.080]   critics aren't often in these jobs.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:21.000]   So they'll look at me and say, um, yeah, you guys must just be trying to optimize for the
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.960]   sake of optimizing.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:29.040]   You must be trying to squeeze in as much as possible because you've fallen in love with
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.200]   a hustle culture, right?
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.400]   Or the reality is people say, no, I don't want to have to optimize my day.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   I don't want to have to do so much every day.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.760]   It's my job has put so much stuff on my plate and I can't keep up with it.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.660]   And it's super stressful and I want to be less stressed.
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:51.160]   So there's this sort of interesting tension between where we want to get with productivity
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.200]   and like what we have to do right now.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.280]   Well the big thing it helps with is not task switching that you talk about all the time.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.280]   It's a huge difference.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.280]   But it's hard, right?
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.360]   Like the way of working with time blocking, you don't test switch.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   I work on this.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.360]   I'm done.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.360]   Now I'm working on this.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.360]   Now I'm done.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.000]   It produces, but that's hard because you have to keep your focus on one thing.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.560]   Then another it's, you know, my, my friends and family know this because I, they text
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.180]   message on a family text thread, right?
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.740]   I'm a ghost on that thing during the day because we are a time blocker.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.060]   You're just like, you're locked in, right?
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:30.940]   You know it's a, it is a more oppressive, faster paced approach to the day.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.600]   But you know, like in my case it allows me to have three jobs and still fit it into nine
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.600]   to five.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.660]   So it's brutally effective.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.660]   But on the other hand, man, it'd be nice not to have to, not to have to do it.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.620]   But even if you go back to like the 1800 or something with like very good schooling, they
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.580]   would probably like teachers there would teach you to work, study and focus on a certain
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.580]   subject, right?
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.580]   They would.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.620]   Uh, you know, this was Teddy Roosevelt secret at Harvard.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:18:00.100]   So if you read, I guess it was probably the Edwin Morris volume one rise and fall of Teddy
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.100]   Roosevelt.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:06.540]   Theodore Roosevelt, uh, he figured this out at Harvard because he had a lot of things
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.540]   he wanted to do.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.420]   He had a lot of interest in hobbies or whatever is that if he could use intense focus, he
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.260]   could get his work done much faster.
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.980]   And he writes about in his diaries how he would like focus like a laser beam.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.820]   Let me get this like reading done.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.380]   He got really good at doing that.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.380]   It's why he could finish a book a day in the white house.
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.100]   He got really good at just when I'm reading laser focus and then he could move really
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.100]   quickly.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:36.360]   You know, it's why he could write a naval history of the war of 1812 while at law school.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.820]   He just would, he could just laser, he just learned laser on one thing, laser on another
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.080]   thing had this really intense concentration.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.940]   So yeah, I mean that's always been known.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.940]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.140]   It's always been known.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.500]   It's funny when I first started listening to your podcast, I changed cause I used to
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.060]   always be list based.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.060]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.180]   So that in my like personal little time list reactive method, I have like the date where
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.180]   I changed.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.180]   Oh yeah.
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.180]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.780]   I was in like 2020 or something when your podcast and have you been too X productive
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.780]   ever since?
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:03.780]   That's been better.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.780]   It's better.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.780]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.580]   But again, it's not, it's not being productive for the sake of being productive is being
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.380]   productive because the stuff is on your list, whether you want it there or not.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.080]   Like your boss gave this to you, whether you want it there or not.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.340]   So getting it done better, faster, that just gives you some breathing room.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.080]   Otherwise you just get in that weird panic state.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.660]   And then once you get overwhelmed enough, then you just end up saying like, ah, late
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.380]   state cap, late stage capitalism, let's just overthrow the economy because you're so behind,
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.740]   you're so overwhelmed by everything.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.740]   It seems kind of hopeless.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.980]   Well, it goes back to everything you're saying, even about the student books, like mapping
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.020]   out your plan, like the semester going forward for studying for exams and stuff, not leaving
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.020]   stuff to the last night.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.020]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.020]   Stuff like that.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.020]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.020]   I mean, that stuff works.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.020]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.500]   I wish I didn't have to do as much of it, but if you have too much to do, you have to
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.420]   care a lot about how you do it.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.180]   So anyways, I'm actually talking to Oliver soon, a couple of days.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.180]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.180]   I like Oliver.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.180]   He's a smart guy.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.180]   His column was great too.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.180]   His books are great.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.180]   His column is great.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.180]   I like his stuff a lot.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.180]   All right.
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.260]   So we've got some cool questions coming up.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.020]   But first, let's hear from some sponsors.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.740]   Want to talk about our friends at Cozy Earth.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.720]   I've talked on the show a lot how my wife and I love Cozy Earth products.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.940]   We started with the sheets.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:26.300]   The sheets are made out of this bamboo derived material that is super soft and super comfortable
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:32.380]   and super, I don't want to say cold, but it like wicks heat away in a way that keeps the
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.340]   sheets just feeling comfortable and cool even in the summer.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:39.500]   We slowly added more sets of these sheets to our rotation because we did not like when
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.180]   one set was being washed, that we would have to have a non-Cozy Earth set on our bed.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.820]   When we travel in the summer, we bring the Cozy Earth sheets with us.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.820]   We have since expanded into other products from Cozy Earth.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.420]   I have one of their sweatshirts made out of the same material.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.460]   I'm telling you, it's crazy.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.100]   You put it on and it feels cold.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.100]   This material is crazy.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:07.300]   It feels cold even when it's warm, I don't even know how you say it, viscose bamboo-based
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.380]   material.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:14.900]   We just got the duvet cover, so now we'll have the sheets and the duvet cover, our Cozy
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.900]   Earth material.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:22.260]   I mentioned before when my parents watched my kids while we were in London for my book
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.460]   tour, the gift we gave them was a set of Cozy Earth sheets.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:31.620]   Anyways, I am a huge booster of Cozy Earth's products.
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.620]   You'll like them.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.620]   We love them.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:43.220]   So remember to go to CozyEarth.com/Cal to enjoy 30% off when you use the code CAL.
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.220]   So after placing your order, oh, okay, then do this.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.820]   All right, so how complicated is this, right?
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.820]   Not at all.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:55.420]   You think I've read this before, but go to CozyEarth.com/Cal and use the code CAL.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.220]   Those two things together is what gives you 30% off.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.500]   You want the 30% off.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:04.860]   These are high-end products, the 30% off, trust me, is going to help.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.420]   Here's the other thing.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.220]   After placing your order, if you would, it's a request from me to you.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.260]   If you would, there's a little survey that pops up.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.860]   Select podcast when it asks where did you hear about Cozy Earth and then select deep
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.520]   questions from the list.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.540]   If you do that, it really helps because then they know that you came to Cozy Earth because
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.540]   of me.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:28.940]   So go to CozyEarth.com/Cal, use that code CAL to get 30% off, and then mention me in
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.460]   the survey afterwards.
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.660]   If you would, every little bit helps.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:37.740]   I also want to talk about our longtime friends at Element, L-M-N-T.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.540]   We've talked about them on the show for a while because I'm a big fan of their drink
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.540]   mix.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.720]   This sort of no sugar, no artificial flavor mix you add right to water, and it gives you
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:53.020]   the electrolytes you actually need, especially after hard exercise or a long day in something
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.900]   like the D.C. climate, gives you what you need without all of the junk.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:02.340]   We have a huge bin full of the Cozy Earth drink mix in our kitchen.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.840]   It's what I drink after workouts.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.380]   It's what I drink after doing long events where I'm speaking a lot, which is very dehydrating,
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.060]   or if I've been out hiking or now I'm in that season of doing thinking walks outside.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:18.720]   I just did two hours the other day in Rock Creek Park, came right back home, Element,
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.380]   get that hydration.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:25.980]   They have this cool new product I want to mention, which is the Element Sparkling, which
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.740]   delivers the same zero sugar electrolyte formulation you already know and trust, but now in a bold
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.760]   16 ounce can of sparkling water.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:39.440]   You can just have it in your fridge and pull it out cold or bring it with you on the go.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.460]   No sugar, no caffeine, all electrolytes.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:46.520]   I'm very excited about the Element Sparkling.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.580]   It's available right now in more of a limited way.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:56.060]   So if you're an Element insider, you have access to it right now.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:02.500]   You can find out more at the website, www.drinkelement.com/deep, but definitely check that out.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.700]   If you're a fan of the drink mixes, you'll be a fan of the sparkling.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:12.220]   So good news, you can get a free sample pack of Element with any drink mix purchase if
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:19.260]   you go to www.drinkelement.com/deep, that's www.drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:25.120]   And as mentioned, if you're an Element insider, you'll have first access to Element Sparkling,
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.820]   a bold 16 ounce can of sparkling electrolyte water.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.620]   So check that out at www.drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:35.660]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.460]   First question is from Sean.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.660]   In an earlier episode, you mentioned you utilized acceptance and commitment therapy to tame
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.740]   anxiety that you had in the past.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:48.620]   In my late 20s, I started having panic attacks due to a high stress move, my job, and overall
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.320]   poor stress management.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.300]   Can you elaborate on your experiences?
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:25:00.060]   Yeah, ACT, acceptance commitment therapy, third wave psychotherapy, it's very well suited
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.060]   for panic attacks.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.660]   I'm glad that you're asking about it.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.820]   So let me just give this some context.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.720]   I'll talk about one of my uses of this.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:15.740]   This was years ago back in grad school where I had developed an insomnia problem, just
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:21.460]   sort of idiopathic, just suddenly there'd be nights where I just wouldn't sleep or wouldn't
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.140]   sleep a lot, which is a problem, right?
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.180]   I mean, whatever, you're being tired.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:31.060]   There's a lot of times in life when you're tired, but I was really thrown by the unpredictability
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.060]   of it.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:37.820]   And I was also really thrown by this idea of like, you can't do your top level cognitive
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.700]   work if you're tired.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.940]   And I couldn't control when insomnia happened or not.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.940]   And then there was this sort of revelation of, you know, hey, I'm not in control here.
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.100]   Like I could just, my job is to think, and this could just be taken away from me by something
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.100]   I can't control.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.180]   So then that gave me a lot of anxiety.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:00.900]   So now I'm in my 20s and it settled into a kind of like a daily, just sort of persistent
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:07.100]   anxiety feeling, the physical, physiological feeling of anxiety, all coming from concerns
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.140]   about sleep that sort of spiraled out of control.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.140]   Because I'm a nerd.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.300]   I read a bunch of books about it and I did some self-treatment, and I'll explain it to
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:20.700]   you in case this is helpful to people, that was a mixture of cognitive behavioral therapy,
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.740]   which is second wave psychotherapy, with ACT, acceptance commitment therapy, which is third
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.740]   wave psychotherapy.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.740]   All right.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.460]   So let me briefly explain both in a way that's going to frustrate sort of any mental health
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.460]   expert in the audience.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.300]   He's like, you're not getting this right, but I'll do my best, right?
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:41.200]   So with cognitive behavioral therapy, this is second wave psychotherapy.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:47.340]   The idea is you point out distortions in your ruminations, the thoughts you're having in
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.420]   your head.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.780]   You point out the distortions in the thoughts, you sort of correct the thoughts you are having.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:27:01.820]   The idea being negative self-talk is the driver of the negative physiological states.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.020]   So if you correct the self-talk, things will be better.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.500]   This was one of the first evidence-based psychotherapies.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.220]   First wave psychotherapy is talk therapy.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.820]   Woody Allen, Annie Hall, you know, you're on the couch, someone talking to you.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.580]   This was the first that was more, we have this protocol, we're going to test it.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.820]   We're going to see if it works or not.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.820]   All right.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.380]   So that's cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.860]   Person's commitment therapy, which came later, that's why we call it third wave, doesn't
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.580]   try to even correct the thoughts.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.940]   It has you diffuse or disconnect from the thoughts.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:34.940]   Yeah, I'm having these thoughts.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.940]   I'm worried about this.
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:36.940]   I'm worried about sleep.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:37.940]   I'm worried about having a panic attack.
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.260]   Yeah, they're there, but that's not reality.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.020]   Those are just thoughts.
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.620]   And in fact, you'll often sort of name the different stories like, oh, here comes the
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.500]   panic attack story, you know, as Captain Panic Attack is giving the story.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.500]   That's interesting.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.500]   That's going on in my head.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.540]   Oh, I'm feeling this thing right now.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.540]   That's interesting.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.940]   I'm feeling my throat's a little tighter.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.940]   I can feel whatever.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.940]   All right.
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.700]   I'm going to go on and do what's important to me.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:04.660]   So you sort of diffuse from the thoughts and keep committing to take what's called value
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.660]   driven action.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.220]   And so you're kind of limiting their power a little bit.
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.220]   All right.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.220]   So what I did for my sleep.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.340]   Here's my combination of the two.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:16.340]   This is my sort of my world famous treatment plan.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:23.460]   Twice a day at set times, we do cognitive behavioral therapy on anxiety about not sleeping.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.500]   There's distortions in this.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.620]   You're predicting the future.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.260]   You're doing black and white thinking.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:33.240]   In between those sessions, it was pure act.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.940]   So when I would feel like the ruminations like, come on, Cal, like, let's get going.
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.940]   Like, let's get into this.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.940]   Let's think about this.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:46.420]   And I would say to myself, oh, I already did dealt with this thought earlier at nine and
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.740]   found that had distortions and that the reality wasn't really so bad.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.740]   I'll revisit that.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.380]   I'm revisiting again at five until then.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.700]   I'm not getting into it.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.460]   I'm just going to do like the best things I can with my time.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.660]   That's kind of pure act.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.300]   And so it was knowing like, you know, I did.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.340]   I'm not going to get into it.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:07.540]   I'm just going to accept the reality that I did a CBT session and there's another one
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.540]   coming up.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:13.820]   And so really, if this thought really is so urgent, if there is a crisis here, I'm going
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.540]   to get into it again at whatever the time was for the second session, five.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.540]   So there's no problem.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.540]   I'm not ignoring it.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.000]   I'm not trying to ignore it or pretend like it doesn't exist.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.740]   But until I get that, I'm just going to do value-driven action.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.740]   That actually was very effective.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.260]   It was very effective over time.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:32.620]   It really reduced, it either reduced the anxiety, sort of went away, the sleep fears would come
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:37.140]   and go, but it didn't have the impact anymore because you weren't feeding the rumination
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.380]   cycle throughout.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:43.900]   So those are the two different types of sort of evidence-based psychotherapies that are
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.900]   out there.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.620]   I combined them in my own, probably non-approved way with my sleep issues in my twenties and
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.820]   actually found that to be very effective.
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:55.860]   You'll, of course, see echoes of this in my shutdown complete routine for your schedule,
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.860]   right?
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.100]   Because I say, after you do your shutdown ritual and you actually say the phrase like
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:06.380]   schedule shutdown complete, when you have ruminations about work, you say, no, no, no.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.420]   I said that crazy phrase or I checked the checkbox in Cal's time block planner.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.140]   I wouldn't have done that if I wasn't sure that it's safe to shut down so I don't have
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.460]   to get into it again.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:18.980]   That's very similar to sort of what I did with my CBT-ACT hybrid when it came to sleep
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.980]   concerns.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:25.120]   So Sean, for panic attacks, classically, it's been seen that ACT is better than cognitive
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:31.180]   behavioral therapy because with panic attacks, if you're worried about panic, having a panic
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.580]   attack, it's not necessarily a distorted thought, right?
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.900]   It's like, no, you might have a panic.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.540]   This is like a thing that comes and goes, like it's not a distorted thought, right?
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.420]   ACT is better here because ACT's like, yeah, you might, but we're still going to do the
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.420]   best things we can with our time.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.820]   And if it happens, it happens.
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.500]   It doesn't define us.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.580]   Let's do something valuable right now.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.660]   So ACT is probably the right match for you.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:31:00.500]   There's a good book called The Happiness Trap, which is the sort of public facing accessible
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.500]   introduction to ACT.
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.660]   So definitely check that out.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:07.260]   But anyways, I wanted to get into just all like CBT versus ACT, what I did with sleep,
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.020]   all as a more general way of emphasizing our minds are weird.
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:17.780]   And one of the ways most commonly our minds can be particularly unhelpful is when we have
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:22.660]   this internal self-talk ruminations that build up around whatever.
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.500]   I'm anxious about this thing happening.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.580]   I'm really worried about what other people think of me.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.340]   Oh man, that conversation I just had, was that good?
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.340]   Oh no.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.340]   I said the weird.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.340]   I said the wrong thing.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.460]   I think people are really upset at me.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.940]   The self-talk drives a lot of the negative physiological states.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.940]   The self-talk drives generalized anxiety disorder.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:47.740]   The self-talk is eventually what drives depressive disorder.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.740]   It's not just boom.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.660]   Oh my God, I'm a hedonic.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:54.900]   It's no, I just came off as six months of like continually berating myself in my mind
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.540]   and all of these things I'm worried about.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:00.520]   So you got to get a handle on the self-talk.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.620]   And that's what the second and third wave psychotherapy is very good at.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.220]   So I just want to introduce these things in here.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.780]   So if you're out there looking for a professional, you sort of know what they're talking about,
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.940]   you know what you're looking for, and you know that there is useful ways of dealing
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:13.940]   with this.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.300]   You're far from alone about it.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.300]   I don't know.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:23.040]   I should, Jesse, I should take my CBT act hybrid I invented and should like market it
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.900]   somehow.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.900]   This is what-
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.460]   New Shopify for the checkout?
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.900]   Shopify for the checkout for my new.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.220]   I got to give it a really cool name.
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.220]   CBT act.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.200]   We can make a, I bet there's, this is like an, an anagram.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   These letters are very useful.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:43.520]   So there's probably an anagram here, Quebec, tabic, exhibit.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.520]   We could put it together.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.400]   Well, we'll get the marketing geniuses on it, but anyway, Sean, thanks for asking that
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.020]   question because it gives me a chance to talk a lot about rumination and mental health.
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.020]   All right.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.020]   What do we got next?
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.020]   All right.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.020]   Next question is from Nate.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.220]   The great, how can I stick to a deep life program and not keep switching based on what
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.460]   I perceive others to be doing?
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.060]   Well, good question, Nate.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:09.740]   You need, first of all, your master narrative that describes your ideal lifestyle.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.860]   It's okay that this is going to change, but it's something that's going to change.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.820]   The change in this is going to be harder and slower than just your whim changes this week
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:19.980]   versus last.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:26.500]   So your master, master narrative about your ideal lifestyle should describe five to 10
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.260]   years from now, what a typical day of your life is going to be like.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:35.700]   It's the type of environment you're in, your interaction with nature and other people,
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.620]   what's going on with your, what's the feel of your work, not the specific job, but the
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.620]   feel of your work.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.700]   It's a master narrative about this is what I want my life, the all elements of my lifestyle
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.100]   to be like, and then we're going to work backwards from that.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.620]   What can I do creatively right now to take advantage of existing opportunities and to
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.100]   get around existing obstacles to move closer to aspects of these lifestyles?
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.840]   And that's where you begin to get creative.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.620]   That's where you begin to build these sort of bespoke plans of sort of moving more towards
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.240]   your ideal lifestyle.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.340]   This is an alternative to the more common approach, which is the grand goal approach.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.460]   We talked about this in a recent episode, but that's the approach where you instead
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.780]   say, I just have this real grand goal that I'm going to go after and it'll solve everything.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.780]   All right?
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.660]   So you have your master narrative about your ideal lifestyle.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:26.380]   Don't make any major changes to that outside of, I'm going to say your birthday.
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.860]   So for a year, you're like, this is my current draft of this.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:36.740]   Do your best to make progress towards this ideal lifestyle on multiple scales, use multiscale
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:41.460]   planning at the seasonal scale, at that filter down to your week and then, uh, to your daily
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.100]   plans, reflect and learn along the way.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.620]   So if there's stuff like, you know, I'm, I'm, I have other ideas coming up that might be
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.980]   needed to be added to my ideal lifestyle, or this aspect of what I have here is not
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.340]   working for me, or I'm learning this about myself.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.980]   I don't really like this.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:01.700]   Make sure that you're capturing those thoughts, but you don't have to act on them yet.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:06.300]   Let that fester, let that marinate, let that evolve and blossom over time.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:11.280]   And when you get back to your next birthday, so let's revisit this ideal master narrative.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.700]   This time, this aspect of time and experience is going to buffer the drastic changes.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.140]   This, it will evolve some years more than others, but it's going to do so in a more
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.140]   thoughtful way.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:25.700]   Um, and this slower sort of annual approach where you build up experience and reflections
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.700]   over the year.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.820]   Uh, this slower approach is also going to protect you from just whim.
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:36.380]   Oh man, I listened to a Goggins on a podcast and like, forget all of this, I got to go
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.380]   hammer it.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.380]   Right.
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:43.180]   It prevents like a, a wave of inspiration leading the drastic changes and how you approach
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.180]   your life.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.180]   Right.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.980]   So if you're thinking about the systematically cultivating a life that feels intentional,
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.060]   you got to just make sure that you have some more buffer in it.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.260]   So that's what I'm going to recommend.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.580]   All right, who do we have next?
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.340]   Next question's from Phil.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:03.140]   I've been embracing your ideas about systematically cultivating a deep life, and it's really made
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.500]   a big difference in a short amount of time.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:09.020]   My girlfriend hasn't adopted these methods, however, and has caught some strain in our
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.020]   relationship.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:15.340]   I especially get annoyed with her checking her phone a lot and not living intentionally.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.820]   What would you recommend in solving this sort of issue?
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.820]   All right.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:24.460]   There's nothing people love more, especially girlfriends, than getting a Cal Newport thrown
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.460]   at them.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.460]   Right.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.340]   They love that almost as much as you telling them what Andrew Huberman thinks you should
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.340]   do with your morning routine.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.340]   All women love that.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.340]   All right.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.560]   I'm going to pull out two separate issues here, Phil.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:43.180]   The checking the phone a lot, I'm going to separate that from the drive to live more
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.180]   intentionally.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.180]   All right.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:50.120]   So when it comes to checking your phone a lot, look, I say, first of all, you do you,
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.120]   right?
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.160]   You do with your phone what you think is right, which if you're a Cal Newport fan probably
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.480]   means no social media on your phone, using something like the phone foyer method at home
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.160]   where you don't have it with you at home.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.400]   It's in a fixed location you go to when you need to check something or communicate with
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.460]   people.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:11.760]   Do a digital declutter, as I talk about in my book, Digital Minimalism, so that you're
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.000]   only using things that like serve real value and you have some fences around how you use
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.140]   it to make sure that you're getting value but not getting trapped in all these other
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.140]   types of distractions.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.160]   So first of all, get your game dialed in.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:28.480]   That's what's most important, is that you're happy with your relationship with your phone.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.560]   I would not try to "fix" your girlfriend's relationship with her phone.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:38.300]   First of all, people don't like being fixed, right, in that manner, especially when they
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.020]   don't think it's a problem.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.300]   And two, you don't know exactly what's going on there.
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:51.420]   Like a typical gender divide, like a stereotypical gender divide I've run into with digital minimalism,
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.060]   and again, it's stereotypical, so it does describe everyone, but often it's the case
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:01.700]   that so a woman with a phone might be spending a lot of time managing relationships in a
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.720]   way that like a guy with a phone might not be.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.500]   And so you see, "My girlfriend's on that phone all the time."
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.100]   You're thinking like, "What would it be if you were on the phone all the time?"
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.860]   And for you, it might be, "Yeah, I would be on like TikTok and YouTube videos, and
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.420]   I don't want to spend a lot of time doing this.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.340]   There's better things to be doing."
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.420]   But your girlfriend might be managing like a really complicated social dynamic that's
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.420]   happening.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.880]   I got an answer here, answer here, make sure this person feels okay, and then it's happening
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.180]   through text message, and it's fraught, and it's complicated, and it's subtle.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.580]   So you don't even know really what's going on there.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.180]   So I would say focus on making your thing good.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:41.540]   If she appreciates what she sees in you and asks you about it, then you can say, "Yeah,
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.540]   here's what I'm up to.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:48.060]   I read this book, Digital Minimalism," sort of give the information to her to take in,
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.580]   but you sort of wait for her to come to you.
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:56.340]   All right, when it comes to living intentionally, now this is something where I think there's
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:01.780]   a distinction between dating and marriage.
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:09.100]   I think married couples need to have, if possible, a shared ideal lifestyle vision, right?
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.340]   You're doing something like deep life planning, you should agree on here is our vision for
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:17.660]   our family, what we want all of the aspects of our day-to-day life to be like five years
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.500]   from now or 10 years from now, like what type of place we're living in, our connection to
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:26.100]   community and family, what our work is like, what type of things it gives to us, but also
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.640]   what type of footprint it has in our lives.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:34.300]   You really imagine these things, and then as a family, you're working towards this.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.740]   You're married, especially when you're starting a family, if you take the tact of like, "I'm
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.780]   just going to try to optimize my career.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.620]   You're going to try to optimize your career.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.820]   We're going to see everything else, everything you need.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.820]   You're going to see everything I need.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.940]   We're going to see everything that our kids need.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:52.220]   All of this is sort of just like an obstacles to our individual optimization," that doesn't
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.020]   work out well.
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:57.260]   Your family vision that you're trying to optimize works well.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.460]   When you're dating, don't do that yet.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.460]   It's too early.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.180]   I don't think it's appropriate yet for the most part.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:07.380]   So when you're dating, work on your own vision, ideal lifestyle, and again, be transparent
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.420]   about what you're doing.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:12.440]   Answer questions about what you're doing, but I don't think you need to be on the same
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:18.400]   page about that until probably after marriage is typically what I recommend.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.420]   By the way, all this stuff is just going to make you seem like a more attractive mate
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:25.660]   if you're not harping on these things, but you're not on your phone all the time.
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.260]   You have a vision of what you want for your life.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.460]   You're making progress towards it.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.780]   These are all really positive things.
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.320]   It's all going to help you.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.300]   You're going to diffuse a lot of that benefit if you preach about it or brag about it.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.700]   Just do that.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.300]   This person really has their act together.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.300]   They really have intention.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.240]   They're really systematic about how they live their life.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.820]   That is an appealing trait, so stick with it.
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.220]   I'm great.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:50.540]   We should have dating advice music we play whenever I give dating advice.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.080]   I feel like it never goes well.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.820]   That's actually a really good idea.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.820]   I'll find some.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.820]   It never goes well.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.380]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.140]   Next question is from Abigail.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.220]   Can you elaborate on the blocks in your planner?
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.100]   For example, how long you're writing blocks?
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.020]   Do you time block classes that you teach?
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.380]   What is your shortest block?
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.380]   Stuff like that.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.380]   Well, okay.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:12.260]   Abigail, when I'm doing time block planning, my entire workday is time blocked, so there's
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.240]   no minute that's not part of a block.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.420]   If you look at a column in my time block planner, it's all blocks of various sizes with no gaps
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.140]   in between.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.460]   That's what a time blocking discipline looks about.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.140]   We ask like, "Oh, do you time block your classes?"
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:30.420]   I mean, every minute has to be in a block, so the minutes that are taking place during
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.140]   my class are going to be in a teaching time block.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:40.460]   The main place where appointments on my calendar differ from the corresponding blocks on my
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.380]   time block planner is that on my time block planner, I'm explicitly typically taking a
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.820]   count of the time required to get to class, to get back from class.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.340]   On a calendar, you usually just put like, "Here's the exact hours of an appointment,"
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.380]   but when you're time blocking, you have to capture the time required to actually get
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:00.380]   there, not get there, because every minute has to be accounted for.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.700]   If you put the 15 minutes right before class starts in a time block dedicated to something
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.780]   else, that's a bad block because you have to spend that 15 minutes not working on that
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.300]   block but getting to your class.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.300]   How long are they?
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.380]   You know, it depends.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:19.540]   Writing, I'm usually at least 90 minutes, I would say.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:25.100]   I'm also willing, and I think it's important about time blocking, you don't get a medal
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.260]   for not adjusting your plan.
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.400]   You get a medal for being intentional about your time.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.460]   It is fine if several times during the day you have to adjust your time block plan for
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.660]   the time that remains in the day.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:39.980]   The key is fixing the plan and having intention and not just falling back to, "Okay, what
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.100]   do I feel like doing?" or "Let me throw in the towel all together on work."
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.660]   So I bring this up because with writing, I often do this.
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.180]   If there's not urgent things happening later, the time blocks are just things I've come
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.260]   up with, like I want to make progress on this, I want to get this done too.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.820]   If the writing is going well, I'll let it blow past the block.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.660]   If I'm in the groove and I can do it, it's not a hard appointment I can't miss, I'll
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.860]   just blow past the block, no problem.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.300]   Fix the schedule for the rest of the day once I'm done writing.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.700]   So the writing sessions can sometimes be three, four hours long, if things are really rolling.
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.740]   All right, let's see what else is in here.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.820]   How long your writing blocks, your time block classes you teach.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.820]   What's the shortest block?
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.820]   All right, another good question.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.620]   30 minutes is the shortest block.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.340]   So if you have something that's going to be quicker than 30 minutes, batch it with other
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.580]   quick things.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.580]   Thirty minutes is usually the shortest I do.
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:29.260]   A little tip for time blockers out there, if you have a little 30-minute block in which
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:34.220]   you're going to do a bunch of things, you can't fit those into a little block on the
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.220]   planner.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.980]   I put a number inside that block, like a one and circle it, and then I replicate that number
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.580]   over on the side.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.180]   And next to it, I put the list of all the things that are supposed to happen in this
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.900]   small block.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:51.780]   Another time block tip I'll give is I like to customize the borders of the blocks based
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.220]   on what type of work it is.
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.420]   Admin work gets a sort of double border, non-filled in though.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:01.240]   So a block and then a slightly smaller block inside.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.500]   Deep work, I fill in that border.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.080]   So it's like a really thick border.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.380]   Meetings or appointments, like where another person's involved, I put three vertical lines
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.380]   on the right side.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.140]   So it's like very clearly this is like a meeting block.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.980]   So I have admin, deep, and meetings.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:20.820]   It just helps me when visualizing my day on my planner to see like, "Okay, here's deep
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.820]   time.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:22.820]   Here's admin time."
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.460]   It just helps me get a better sense than all those blocks being the same.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.060]   So there's a couple of advanced tactics there.
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:32.100]   I have a really long expository introduction at the front of every time block planner I
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.180]   sell where I get into a lot of these details and I give a lot of these extra tips.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.460]   There's a lot of diagrams of time block planners.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:42.820]   It's unusual for a planner to come with like a chapter of a book, but mine does because
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.540]   I'm a writer and I thought it was important to really walk you through exactly how to
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.340]   do this and the advanced tips and tricks.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:53.180]   So the best thing I've ever written about time blocking is actually the text in the
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.660]   front of my time block planner.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.180]   It's interesting.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.740]   All right.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.500]   Our next question is our slow productivity corner question of the week.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:15.660]   So Jessie, let's get that slow productivity corner music if we could.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:19.260]   So for those who don't know, I try to have one question every week that's relevant to
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:26.260]   my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout, so that
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.980]   we can get into the details of that book.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:30.980]   If you haven't bought that book yet, check it out.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.820]   Slow productivity, you can find it anywhere.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.700]   You can also go to calnewport.com/slow to get an excerpt or to hear an audio excerpt
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.700]   of me reading it, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:48.560]   We're coming up now, Jessie, on the 100,000 copies sold mark, which is an important mark
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.560]   to me.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.980]   Like symbolically, it's always a mark I like to hit.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.740]   Because it's been three months because it came out March 7th, right?
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:56.740]   Yeah.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:57.740]   So far, so good.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:58.740]   We're rock and rolling.
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.580]   If you haven't bought the book yet, check it out.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:01.580]   People are digging it.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:05.060]   And if you dug it, maybe give a nice review or tell someone about it.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.060]   I mean-
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.740]   Buy your dad for Father's Day?
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.460]   Excellent gift for Father's Day.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.460]   Excellent gift.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.340]   I would recommend getting four copies though, right?
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:16.580]   Because you need one in your room, you need one at your office, you need one in your car
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:19.460]   in case like you're stuck waiting to pick someone up-
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.460]   And you don't want to go on your phone.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:24.660]   And you want to go on your phone, so you need one for the car as well, and then you need
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.660]   one for the bathroom.
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:29.860]   So buy four copies of Slow Productivity for your dad for this Father's Day.
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.940]   If you don't, I'm going to play the theme music again and again and again.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:33.940]   All right.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.940]   Let's see.
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.900]   What is our Slow Productivity corner question of the day, Jesse?
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.580]   Hi, it's from Janet.
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:43.340]   In your book, Slow Productivity, you recommend obsessing over quality, but I sometimes find
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.340]   this paralyzing.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:50.660]   I worry so much dealing or so much doing about other things really well that I procrastinate.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.300]   Is it really that important to care so much about quality?
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:54.980]   It's a good question, Janet.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.420]   A lot of people wonder about this.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:02.620]   I think the verb obsess troubled some people as well.
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:04.780]   So it's worth diving into this again briefly.
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.940]   For those who didn't read my book, I have three principles of Slow Productivity.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.620]   The first is do fewer things.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.700]   The second is work at a natural pace.
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:18.820]   The third is obsess over quality, which I argue is the glue for the whole program.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.340]   So why is this important?
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:24.140]   Well, there's two reasons.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:29.340]   When you begin to care more and more about how well you do the best thing you do, busyness
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:36.020]   of the type that defines our current pseudo productivity age begins to seem unnecessary
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.180]   and eventually to seem negative.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:42.020]   You begin to develop a distaste for busyness.
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:49.420]   When you're not caring about quality, busyness can be, in some sort of masochistic way, attractive.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:54.980]   Like, at least if I'm busy, I can't be accused of being a slacker.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:48:00.140]   At least if I'm busy, I can't tell myself, you know, "Hey, you're not really getting
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.140]   it done here."
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.820]   At least if I'm busy, there's some safety in this.
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.020]   I know how to do busyness.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.540]   This is all I know about doing work well.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.540]   It's safe.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:09.540]   It's predictable.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:13.140]   Once you start caring about doing something really well, you start to see results.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.460]   The busyness becomes an obstacle.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.300]   I can't make progress on this thing because I'm so busy with all these other things.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.060]   So the other principles of pseudo productivity, the doing fewer things at once, the working
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:30.980]   at a natural pace, begin to seem self-evident once you begin to pursue quality.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.180]   The other thing that happens, and this is part of the nice flywheel effect, as you get
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:38.660]   better at something professionally, you get more freedom to dictate what your work looks
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.080]   like.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:44.660]   So as you get better at something, you're going to develop a distaste for busyness.
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:47.420]   At the same time, you get more leverage to remove busyness from your life.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:53.580]   So these things work together, it's good symbiosis, it gives you the power you need.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:59.560]   A big talking point I hear from people I talk about, about slow productivity, they're like,
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.740]   you know, a lot of the stuff I get, a lot of the stuff I give advice for, like, here's
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.740]   how you do this right now in your job with a boss who's a pain.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:11.180]   But they're like, you know, I could do this so much better if I had more control, but
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.180]   I don't have control.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:13.180]   My boss is really a pain.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.260]   So I can do some of your advice, but some of the big ideas I can't do, and I feel like
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.060]   I'll never be able to do them because my boss will never let me do them.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:23.020]   This is how you earned a right to do them, right?
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.480]   You get really good at something, they're desperate to keep you.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.480]   They really want your skill.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   Your skill is very valued.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.260]   Now you say, yeah, I'll stay, but here's how I'm going to do it.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.660]   And now you begin to gain more control.
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:38.220]   So slow productivity, the tactics in the book, part of them are just like right away, put
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.180]   these into action right now.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.100]   They're pragmatic.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.980]   The other half are inspirational.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.780]   You might not be able to do these now, but they're possible.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:47.780]   You can get there.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:52.700]   Yeah, you can't do this all tomorrow, but a year from now, you could, if you get really
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.100]   good at something.
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.820]   That is your weapon you can wield against the scourge that is pseudo productivity generated
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:49:59.820]   busyness.
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:07.060]   All right, now the other issue Janet brings up here is the paralyzation, otherwise known
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.060]   as perfectionism.
[00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:12.580]   If I start caring about doing something really well, maybe I'll never finish it because I'm
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.060]   never satisfied or I'm worried like this isn't that good yet.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.780]   I need to do another draft of this novel.
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:21.420]   I need to try to make this computer code even tighter and maybe you'll never actually ship
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.420]   it.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:27.940]   So if you care too much about quality, you might fall into perfectionism.
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.780]   So I really get into this in the book because I think it's an important point.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:36.820]   How do you obsess over quality without giving in to perfectionism, which is a natural corollary?
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.780]   The fear of perfectionism is a natural, unavoidable corollary to obsessing over quality.
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.660]   How do we walk this tightrope?
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.380]   Well, the idea I give comes from a story about the Beatles.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.460]   I've told it on the show before, so I'll be very quick.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:56.620]   But in the book, I get into the Beatles recording Sergeant Pepper.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:00.100]   And the important thing about this album is that it was the very first album they were
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.180]   recording where they knew they were not going to tour.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:07.620]   So they did not have to write songs that could be replicated on stage during a tour, which
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.660]   meant basically they could do anything in the songs, any weird instrument.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.260]   They could play with the tape speeds.
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:18.960]   They could overlay track after track in unusual or cacophonous arrangements.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   Everything was possible.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.260]   And they wanted this thing to be really, really good.
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:25.480]   This is prime procrastination territory.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:30.700]   They could have stayed in Abbey Road Studios forever trying to build their masterpiece.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:34.060]   So how did they walk the line here between quality and perfectionism?
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.940]   George Martin released the first thing they had that looked like a single.
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.100]   He released it.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.820]   Now they had a stake in the ground.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:42.860]   They had some pressure.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.580]   We want to make this good, but we also have to ship it.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.660]   We can't take too much longer because the single's out and we can't have the album come
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:50.840]   out too much after the single.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:54.500]   They still took much longer on that album that they did other albums.
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:58.900]   They obsessed more about the quality than other albums, but they had to make compromises
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.780]   and finish things and get something out.
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:05.040]   It became their best-selling album to date once it did.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:10.180]   That is the key, Janet, to navigating perfectionism and quality.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.620]   You need to put stakes in the ground.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.100]   I want to do this really well, but I promised this to this person.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.740]   This person is expecting this by this time.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:17.980]   I've made an announcement about this.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.740]   This has to happen pretty soon.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:22.940]   And once you put the stake in the ground, it changes the stakes from producing the best
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:27.440]   thing that could ever possibly be produced to producing something really good given the
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.060]   amount of time you have left.
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.940]   That is the sort of pragmatic way to actually get better at things.
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:36.420]   It's the pragmatic way to produce stuff that's too good to be ignored without subcoming to
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.780]   the full pressures of perfectionism.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:40.780]   All right, Janet.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:44.580]   So thank you for that slow productivity corner question of the week.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.500]   Want to hear the music again?
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.500]   Let's hear it again.
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:57.980]   If you don't buy your four copies of the book, that's all you're going to hear.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:58.980]   All right.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.140]   Do we have a call this week?
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.140]   We do.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:03.140]   All right.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.140]   Let's hear this.
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:05.140]   Hi, Cal.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:10.540]   My name is Emily, and I work for a small nonprofit organization with national reach.
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:14.500]   I have a question that I hope you can help me with considering your recent book tour
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.500]   experience.
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:20.440]   I travel for work roughly once every six weeks, and these trips can last anywhere from four
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.060]   to nine days.
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:26.420]   The reason for my travels varies, but most often it's for conferences that require me
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:32.720]   to be up early and attending sessions and professional dinners until late in the evening.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:36.780]   These events significantly disrupt my daily habits, routines, and rituals.
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:41.940]   I find that it often takes several days after I return, especially if there's a time change,
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:44.380]   to feel that I'm back to my normal rhythms.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:48.540]   Of course, some habits and routines are easier to pick back up than others.
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:54.260]   What suggestions do you have for how to get back on track quickly after disruptive periods?
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:59.140]   And are there habits and routines that you try to keep when you are doing your travels?
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.140]   Thanks.
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:02.160]   It's a good question, Emily.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.740]   A couple things here I think are relevant.
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:10.740]   One, when it comes to being during your travels, it is good to understand your stripped down
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.460]   systems that you're going to use, and they really should be stripped down.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.540]   So you have to acknowledge that traveling is not the same as just being at your office.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:22.460]   There's much less you can actually do in terms of the normal work you do.
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.300]   You should lean into that.
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.660]   Really warn people ahead of time.
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.540]   I will be traveling during this period.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:29.540]   Get people prepared for that.
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:33.700]   You can even use an autoresponder if you need to so that expectations are set, that you're
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:38.740]   not as accessible as normal, that you're not able to be part of hyperactive hive mind on-the-fly
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.140]   interactions as much as before.
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:43.140]   I think that's helpful.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.620]   I think it's helpful to schedule, if it's a nine-day trip, two or three check-ins.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:53.180]   All right, let's have a half hour pre-scheduled on our calendar that works with, in this case,
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.180]   the conference schedule.
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:56.180]   Or just in real time, we get caught back up.
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.180]   What's going on?
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.180]   What do you need from me?
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.700]   I'm reflecting a lot of emails and chat, just like we have a couple check-ins.
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:02.700]   Let me just check in.
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.700]   What's going on?
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.700]   Do this.
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.700]   Do that.
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:06.700]   Put a pin in that.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.080]   It's a much more effective way of allowing you to deal with stuff that comes up while
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:14.060]   you're away without having to have you always constantly try to be connected.
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:17.300]   As I mentioned, you should streamline the set of systems or habits you use.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:22.140]   You're not going to time block, for example, because if you're at a conference, it's fluid.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:23.780]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.420]   What's going to happen next?
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:29.100]   Don't have a lot of expectations for getting a lot of deep work done.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:33.480]   I often like to have one sort of contemplative project to work on, something I'm in the early
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   stages of.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.780]   And so I put all of my decompressed time, I'm going to go for a walk by this river,
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:43.700]   I'm going to go explore the town, the sort of decompressed time I can have one thing
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.460]   to think about.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:48.660]   And over like a week-long trip, you can make pretty cool progress if you keep thinking
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.860]   about something in these unusual environments.
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:54.220]   But don't expect to do too much more deep work outside of that.
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:57.420]   And I would schedule admin blocks onto my calendar each day.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:02.380]   Here's the one hour I'm going to sit down and try to crank through everything that's
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.380]   admin.
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:07.220]   So it's all about consolidation, so that most of your time you can just be doing the thing
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:10.660]   you're there to do and not be worrying too much about the other things.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:14.740]   On the way back, if it's a long trip, take a day off the day after, either officially
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:18.560]   or not, just to sort of gain back your energy.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:22.740]   Then you need an entire full day of catch-up, right?
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.780]   So it's a, I'm going through my inbox, I'm going through my calendar, I'm going through
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:32.140]   my quarterly plan, my weekly plan, you know, let me get a new weekly plan.
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:35.540]   It's like you're wrapping your arms around things, you're pushing things off, you're
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.780]   telling people I'm back now, but let's wait two weeks to get into it.
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:43.660]   You're sort of touching on everything that got temporarily frozen.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:49.420]   You're touching on everything, updating your plans, moving things around, no like long
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.460]   deep work, no meetings, just like getting your arms around everything, spend an entire
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:55.820]   day doing that.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.680]   And then you can hit the ground running the next day.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:01.860]   I think the biggest problem people have in this situation, especially after long trips,
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:07.140]   is they try to interleave the catch-up with like a normal day of work.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.420]   And then it's like, oh my God, the normal day of work doesn't work, the catch-up is
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:14.700]   overwhelming, the overwhelmingness then gives you more resistance to your standard systems
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:17.460]   and rituals because those don't work well when you feel super stressed.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:19.540]   So just give it the time it requires.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:24.460]   A good way to do this is just when you schedule your trip, you add that one or two days on
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:29.180]   the end onto your calendar as well.
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:34.140]   So then when you're in the future, when you're scheduling meetings and such, you just don't
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.140]   use those days.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.820]   You've blocked them off just like the seven or eight days before that are part of your
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:38.820]   trip.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.900]   So just add that one or two days as part of any long trip on your calendar, protect those
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:45.380]   days, one day off, one day catch-up, then get back into it.
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:50.460]   You will not have as much heart of a time as you think getting back into your ritual
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:52.500]   if you have your handle on everything.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:53.700]   So that's what I would recommend.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.260]   I do that for sure.
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:59.100]   After every major trip, there's definitely a catch-up day.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:03.400]   All right, we've got a case study here.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:08.420]   So something else we like to do is read case studies sent in by you, my listeners, about
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:11.940]   how you have specifically put the type of things we talk about in the show into action
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:12.940]   in your own life.
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:16.940]   It allows people to see sort of what practically these type of ideas look like when the rubber
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:19.300]   hits the proverbial road.
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:23.300]   So our case study today comes from Prudence.
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.220]   Prudence says, "I'm a huge fan of your work, and I wanted to share with you some of the
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:29.700]   ways it has impacted my work and life.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.860]   I was introduced to your work through your conversation with Lewis Howes on the School
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:38.940]   of Greatness podcast when you were talking about digital minimalism.
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:43.900]   I closed off my personal Facebook account in 2012, but had found a pullback to social
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:48.940]   media platforms by the mainstream marketing narrative that it is essential to have a presence
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:52.340]   on social media to run a successful business.
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:56.740]   Digital minimalism helped me question those beliefs and find other ways to market my business
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:00.420]   which feel more aligned.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:06.020]   The ideas in your book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, were also fundamental, this time
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:09.340]   in shifting my mindset around my career.
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:16.500]   In my 20s and 30s, working as a divorce lawyer with the popular message, follow your passion,
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:20.740]   it was tempting to think that doing away with law and the pressures of billable hours and
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:25.620]   constant deadlines was the way to go and that I should seek out a totally different job.
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:29.300]   But your work helped me open my mind to the possibility of leveraging the career capital
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:34.140]   I had worked on over 18 years of legal practice to build and serve my clients in a different
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.140]   way.
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.900]   Drawing on the ideas in So Good They Can't Ignore You and your lifestyle-centric career
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:44.100]   planning model, I now work as a divorce coach consultant, which uses my skills and experience,
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:48.980]   but also helps support my broader lifestyle vision.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.820]   In 2022, I sold my bricks and mortar legal practice.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:57.840]   As my coaching practice now is entirely online, my family and I were able to fulfill a long-term
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:04.220]   dream of moving from a capital city to a regional beachside community on Australia's sunshine
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.740]   coast.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:10.580]   The career change has also afforded me the flexibility to be a present and involved parent
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.620]   and contribute to our local community.
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:20.220]   All right, well, Prudence, I really appreciate this case study because it actually captures
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:24.540]   a few different ideas from my canon that I think are worth emphasizing.
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:29.540]   I love your application of digital minimalism, where instead of just using things by default
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:36.140]   until they prove themselves to be dangerous, you instead say, "My default's not using something
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:39.380]   until I see its value is really clear and can't be avoided, and then I'll use it with
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:40.700]   rails around it."
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:44.460]   When you did this with your online business as a divorce coach, you actually found it
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:49.300]   sounds like social media wasn't super important, and that saved you from having to be caught
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.660]   in a relationship with that tool that you didn't really like.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:55.420]   I then love your application of my career capital theory from So Good They Can't Ignore
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.420]   You.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:01.660]   It's the idea that says the thing that matters most in cultivating a career you love is getting
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:06.780]   good at things and then investing the metaphorical career capital that generates to get things
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.820]   in your job you really want.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.300]   The stuff that makes great jobs great is in demand.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.820]   You have to do something great to earn it.
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.100]   So I love this way of thinking.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:18.860]   The follow your passion model that I push back against in So Good They Can't Ignore
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:23.300]   You would have told you, as you mentioned here, "This isn't your passion.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.180]   Being a lawyer is not your passion.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.180]   Quit it.
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.960]   It's completely different."
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.140]   That would have been probably a big mistake because without career capital, this different
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.500]   thing would probably not give you what you need.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:39.220]   And finally, what a great example of the core component of my deep life philosophy, which
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.220]   is working backwards.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.460]   We've talked about this throughout the show.
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.060]   Working backwards from your ideal narrative, your master narrative of an ideal lifestyle.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.580]   And you guys, you had this narrative and you didn't give us the details, but it seems like
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:56.700]   it involved living in a quieter place, living closer to nature, more time with family and
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:02.140]   flexibility, but also implicitly freedom from worrying a lot about finances.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:06.940]   And so to move closer to that vision, you took the career capital that you had generated
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:13.540]   being a successful lawyer for all these years to build up this consultant coaching practice,
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:17.840]   which requires your really specialized skills, which allows you to probably charge a good
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:23.060]   amount of money, but it's way more flexible than billable hours, actually being on cases,
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:26.900]   and is fully remote and allowed you to now move to that other location that's going to
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.180]   be much better to you.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.140]   That's classic deep life sort of jujitsu right here.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.100]   It's not one grand gesture.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.420]   It's you figuring out, "If I use this skill over here and this develops, it'll eventually
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.300]   allow me to do X, Y, and Z, that's going to be a better situation."
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:45.200]   A little key point, a nuance in here I want to emphasize for the listener.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:51.200]   Notice how she said, "By 2022, I was able to sell my standard legal practice and do
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.000]   the coaching full time."
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.580]   That meant she started this thing on the side, validated it was working, built it up in a
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:01.420]   natural way, had evidence it was doing well before she quit the legal practice.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.620]   It's not always grand gestures for the deep life.
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:08.340]   It's knowing what your ideal lifestyle looks like and constantly creatively looking at
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.300]   ways to move you closer.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:15.940]   So a masterclass prudence in cultivating a more meaningful life along the way applying
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.140]   other ideas for my books.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.140]   So I appreciate that.
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.140]   It's a good case study.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.100]   And anybody can send case studies to me at jesse@calnewport.com.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.100]   Yeah, please do.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.100]   We love them.
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.100]   All right.
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.340]   So we have a cool final segment coming up about a sort of surprise appearance of this
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:31.860]   podcast at some place kind of well-known.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.780]   But first, let me tell you about another sponsor.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:40.500]   In particular, I want to talk about our friends at Mint Mobile.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.180]   So people talk a lot about spring cleaning.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.060]   I'm a much bigger believer in summer cleaning.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.260]   We're busy in the spring.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.260]   Summer is better.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.260]   That's when school gets out.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:52.620]   So we're doing a lot of that now in the Newport household.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.620]   We just did the kids' lockers.
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.700]   A lot of other stuff's happening as well.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:03.180]   Anyways, a takeaway, right, a takeaway from this is that sort of post-clean clarity where
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.820]   you're like, "How was I living like this before?
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.860]   How was I living with my kids' lockers being so jammed with junk?
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:13.100]   How are we living before with so much stuff on the floor of my oldest son's bedroom?"
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.060]   That's an argument that we've been having for a long time.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:17.840]   This is kind of like the same clarity.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:23.060]   It's like figuring out that you've been paying way too much for wireless.
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:28.620]   Mint Mobile has phone plans that start at $15 a month when you purchase only a three-month
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.540]   plan, right?
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:35.540]   You've been spending a lot on your wireless, and now you're wondering, "How did I ever
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:36.540]   live like that?
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.260]   I could be spending a lot less."
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:43.420]   It's time to switch to Mint Mobile to get unlimited talk, text, and data for $15 a month.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:48.180]   You can say bye to the overpriced wireless plan that's sucking that money out of your
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.620]   bank account right now.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:54.140]   Mint Mobile will rescue you with a premium wireless plan with costs starting as low as
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.860]   $15 a month.
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:01.500]   All these plans come with high-speed data, unlimited talk and text delivered on the nation's
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.260]   largest 5G network.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:07.900]   You can use your own phone and bring your existing phone number and contacts along when
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.260]   you switch to Mint Mobile.
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:15.260]   I've actually been talking about Mint Mobile a lot at school.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:19.580]   One of the issues I'm involved with at my kid's school is phone use and when kids should
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.020]   get phones.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.020]   They go to a school in DC.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:27.140]   A lot of the kids take public transportation, so parents want to have some way of contacting
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.140]   their kids.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:32.980]   They're wondering, "How do I get a phone to my kid to use without having to give them
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:33.980]   a smartphone?"
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.580]   I've been telling a lot of people, "Mint Mobile."
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:42.420]   You can buy a dumb phone on Amazon, buy a flip phone, $15 a month plan is not that expensive
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.420]   at all.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:48.940]   Now, a lot of parents are using Mint Mobile as a way to have a phone plan for their kids
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:52.980]   so they can stay in touch with them in emergencies without having to give them an iPhone and
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.540]   $150 a month plan.

[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.380]   See Mint Mobile for details.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:37.360]   Let's also talk about our longtime friends at Policy Genius.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:42.380]   We talk a lot on the show about the deep life, but another thing you have to know about life
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:45.260]   is that it is unpredictable.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.780]   Bad things can happen.
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:52.780]   If people depend on you, you need to make sure that you have enough life insurance.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:57.980]   Not just some life insurance, but actually enough life insurance that if the unthinkable
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.700]   happens, those who depend on you will be taken care of.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:04.660]   Why do so many people who know this not have enough life insurance?
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.260]   It's because they don't know how to get started.
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:09.900]   It's one of these ambiguous tasks that just lurks there on your Trello board under to
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.440]   process and just sits there because you don't know what to do with it.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.220]   How do I go get life insurance?
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.020]   Who do I talk to?
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:21.260]   This is where Policy Genius enters the scene.
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:27.060]   It helps you easily compare your options from America's top insurers in just a few clicks.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:32.740]   Their award-winning agents can even walk you through the process step by step.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:37.700]   It has no incentive to recommend one insurer over another, it's a marketplace, so you can
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:38.700]   trust their guidance.
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.820]   They just want to get you a plan that works for you.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:45.620]   Their thousands of five-star reviews on Google and Trustpilot from customers who found the
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:50.820]   best fit for their needs attest to how well they do this.
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:57.060]   So Policy Genius makes the logistical task of doing this very important act much easier.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:02.520]   You can go to Policy Genius to get this to-do list item crossed off right away.

[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.460]   All right, Jessie, let's do our final segment.
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:30.540]   All right, so this was a nice little treat, but I'm going to use it as an excuse to talk
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:35.860]   about something a little bit more specific to the show.
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:40.660]   Deep Questions, our podcast that you're listening to here, it made a cool appearance at the
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:44.460]   Apple WWDC, their Worldwide Developers Conference, right?
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:46.460]   So they have this big splashy conference.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.620]   I think you probably remember it from years past when Steve Jobs would give these big
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:51.140]   keynotes.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:55.820]   One of the big speeches, it's a pre-produced video, but one of the big presentations at
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:59.300]   this conference is what they call the Platform State of the Union.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:04.180]   So if you're someone who develops for Apple platforms, this is sort of like the big deal
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:08.660]   speech where they talk about here's what's coming up with the platforms, what new features
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:11.660]   or capabilities are coming along, and you can think about like, "Hey, what can I do
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:14.140]   with the apps or whatever I build for it?"
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:21.180]   Anyways, Deep Questions made a little cameo in the WWDC Platform State of the Union.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:24.100]   I think Jessie's going to bring this up on the screen here.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:27.940]   So if you're watching, you can see there, someone is on the screen.
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.820]   She's talking about, there we go.
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.100]   See it, Jessie?
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.100]   Yep.
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:37.700]   She's saying the Deep Questions podcast is on an Apple Watch next to it as some computer
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:38.700]   code.
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:42.540]   So it was a segment where they were really talking about some new hooks in the computer
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:46.020]   code if you're writing apps for the watch to make it easier, but hey, Deep Questions
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:49.360]   is what they chose as the sort of sample podcast there.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.300]   So I think at least when it comes to our nerd audience, we're doing very strong.
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:58.220]   I got maybe six messages from listeners who saw that, which meant we have at least six
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:03.780]   listeners who were really carefully watching the WWDC State of the Union Platform conference.
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.780]   It kind of makes sense.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:06.780]   It does.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.620]   I'm a computer scientist, so we sort of get it.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:15.620]   So I thought this would be a good excuse to give a brief State of the Union of our own
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:16.620]   on the Deep Questions podcast.
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:20.420]   It was mentioned in the Apple State of the Union, let's have our own State of the Union.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:27.680]   Like a few thoughts about the podcast, how it's going, and sort of what we have in mind.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:32.420]   So I would say the State of the Union here, should we say, is strong, Jesse.
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.900]   I mean, I think the show is doing well.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:41.460]   I feel like a lot of things I do, it is successful, but somewhat underground.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:45.740]   We're not a runaway top of the category hit.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:51.900]   It's not like Lex Fridman show or something that's just dominating, but it's really actually
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:55.260]   a little underneath the covers, underneath the waves a little bit, but we have a really
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.260]   big audience.
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.260]   It's doing really well.
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:58.260]   Our listeners really like us.
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:10:59.260]   We sell out all of our slots.
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:05.620]   I think this is the sweet spot because it means we can have a strong community of listeners,
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:09.300]   but people outside of this community don't know about us.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.100]   So we can have our own little thing going on here.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.100]   That's my sweet spot.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:13.740]   My newsletter is sort of like that as well.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.660]   A lot of my books are like that as well.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:19.020]   It will sell a lot of copies, but it's not atomic habits.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:24.260]   So we can have a big audience and we're all in on the club together, but the club can
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:27.860]   still feel a little bit secret, a little bit special.
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.940]   So I'd like that about where we are right now.
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:35.660]   A couple of the thoughts I wrote down, the pandemic was started, I mean, the podcast
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:39.780]   was started rather early in the pandemic back in 2020s.
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:46.340]   I was listening to a lot of podcasts, sort of lonely and was like, Hey, let's, um, I
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.380]   think I'll finally pull the trigger on podcasting because I want to have a way of sort of talking
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:53.300]   to people and not just be, you know, by myself.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:58.220]   I think that inflects, there's like a big inflection from that origin stories and what
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.380]   you hear on this podcast.
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:03.980]   I think if I had started this podcast in very early 2020 or 2019, it would have been more
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:07.060]   100% just tech and tech impact.
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:08.060]   What's going on with your phone?
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.060]   What's going on with your email?
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:13.680]   And that's still a huge portion of what we talk about, but we have this third leg to
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:19.060]   our conversations on the deep life, this idea of systematically building an intentional
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:23.060]   life as a bulwark against all these digital forces.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:28.700]   It's hard, for example, to, uh, step away from the distraction to versions of your phone.
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:32.460]   If you don't have something better to step towards, right?
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:38.180]   It's hard to leave the scrum of email Slack driven busyness at work.
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:42.740]   If you don't have a better vision of what work could be without it.
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:47.440]   So this deep life idea has become critical to these otherwise technology driven topics.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.860]   That is an impact of when and how this podcast was started.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.020]   We were just thinking about these things in the spring of 2020.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.780]   I was newslettering, the deep life just sort of came out of nowhere when I was writing
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:59.340]   a daily newsletter in the first month of the pandemic.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.500]   It was just the vibe.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:04.500]   The vibe was a lot of people, especially in the knowledge worker tech space saying, what
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.500]   am I doing with my life?
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.860]   What do I want to do with it?
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:10.500]   And I was saying, Hey, we can talk about this and I'll bring some of my systematic nerd
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.100]   sort of algorithmic approach to it.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.020]   It won't be touchy feely vibes.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:18.700]   It'll be matrices and buckets and whatever.
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:19.860]   But let's talk about this.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:25.060]   And so that's an interesting twist to this podcast and that's where that came from.
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:29.540]   That it happened to be started during a moment early in a pandemic where a lot of us were
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:31.960]   thinking about these issues.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.500]   The final thing I'll stay in the state of the unit of the podcast.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:38.220]   It's something I really look forward to recording each week and hopefully that comes through.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:41.040]   I just talk about what I like to talk about.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.620]   Like these are the things I like to talk about.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:46.020]   We have our weird little community here.
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:50.680]   Our sort of deep life, deep work, digital minimalism geek community on here.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.940]   I only talk about what I'm excited to talk about.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:57.340]   You know, some stuff is probably more popular than others.
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:00.900]   It's certainly probably not down the mainstream, like what's going to grow things a lot.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.400]   And I love that about the show.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:07.020]   For me, what makes it work longterm is not trying to make it work too much in the short
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.180]   term.
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.540]   These are the things I care about.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.360]   I'll spend a year talking about something that maybe I'm developing into a book.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.260]   So I'm going to give this a good, the state of the union of the podcast is strong.
[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:19.060]   It's doing well.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:21.760]   It's the right size.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.020]   It pays for itself, right?
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.020]   That's the right size.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:26.840]   Our team now.
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.840]   How big are we now?
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.360]   So Jesse, you and I are the core people on the show.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.100]   We have, um, what's our ancillary team now?
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:36.000]   We have an editor, the indomitable Mark.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.440]   We have a YouTube guy, the indomitable Jeremy, and that's basically it.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:40.800]   I think we run this pretty lean, right?
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.320]   Am I missing someone?
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.320]   That's it.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.320]   There you go.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320]   So Jess and I run this with just like a little bit of help.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320]   We are a cool HQ.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.260]   So anyways, thanks for listening, everyone who's listening.
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:53.920]   I'm still having fun doing this.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.100]   It's doing what I need it to do for me and my life.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.380]   It's filling what I want it to fill.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:03.380]   And so it's a lot of fun, so let's just keep doing it.
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:06.120]   What did you think about first starting it?
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.920]   Like you said, you thought about like eight years ago, right?
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.520]   I mean, all throughout I became, so it's interesting kind of backstory.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:21.200]   It reminds me of, there was definitely, this is a weird connection, but you'll see why
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.200]   it makes sense.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:27.560]   There were some professional comedians and who came up in the seventies and eighties
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:30.840]   like Steve Martin, Albert Brooks.
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.680]   And the way they came up is there's a lot of talk shows, you know, there's like the
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.320]   tonight show, et cetera, but a lot of shows during the day as well.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.880]   There was like the Merv Griffin show and all these other, Donny and Marie and all these
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.520]   shows that were just on TV.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:49.480]   And there was this group of comedians coming up that just did all those shows all the time.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:52.280]   Martin was just doing all of those shows all the time, right?
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.620]   Before he finally got to the tonight show, Albert Brooks was just doing all those shows
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:56.620]   all the time.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:00.520]   Well, starting around 2014 in the media space, this was podcast.
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:06.000]   And I was sort of doing all these shows because deep work had come out and had become an underground
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   hit.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.440]   And a lot of people were asking me on these shows and this sort of early stage of this
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.920]   type of podcasting.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.720]   And I was just doing all the shows.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:19.120]   I'm just someone who was just around and really got used to this medium and it was just a,
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.800]   and have been a sort of mainstay.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:26.160]   This is why like you get the 2024 and you know, this new book comes out and I basically
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.920]   did like all the major shows.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.120]   This is like a decade of, I've just been on the circuit for a decade.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.680]   I just, I know how to do it.
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.360]   I know a lot of the people in it.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:38.600]   So not surprisingly throughout this whole period, people have constantly been saying,
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.080]   start your own show, start your own show.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.520]   And I was always saying no, because I said, do less, do better.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.520]   No.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.520]   Why?
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.520]   That takes time.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520]   I'm very worried about things to take time.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.520]   I have young kids at home.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.520]   I'm trying to get tenure.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.520]   I'm writing books.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.520]   It's enough.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.520]   Enough is enough.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:55.560]   Uh, so you know, it wasn't really until the pandemic freed up a lot more time that I was
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.560]   like, okay.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.040]   And I was lonely that I said, I'm going to pull the trigger.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.360]   That's what led me to finally pull the trigger on it.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.360]   Got it.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360]   And I'm glad I am.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.560]   And we keep it to a half day a week.
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.560]   And I think that really works.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.920]   It doesn't have a huge footprint on my schedule and it's doing well.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:14.280]   I mean, at the very least it gives us the glory that is the deep work HQ, which is nice.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.280]   What we do without the HQ.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.760]   So one other quick point, uh, Drake is feuding with Kendrick Lamar.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.320]   All right.
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:27.820]   So the two big feuds going on at the moment, Drake and Kendrick Lamar, Cal Newport and
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:35.520]   Oliver Berkman similar in many ways, similar in terms of like the perceived coolness of
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:43.120]   the participants, similar in terms of the savagery of the rap related attacks.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:47.640]   Very similar, not someone to way that actually this doesn't work anymore.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:51.120]   This bit doesn't work anymore because my whole deep dive was about how I agree with Oliver.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.120]   He's right.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.800]   So it's not an effective, that is not an effective way to feud.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.800]   Like Kendrick is right.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:57.800]   All right.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:58.800]   Enough of this.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.800]   Thanks everyone who's listening.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.480]   Uh, we'll be back next week with another episode and until then, as always,
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:03.980]   stay bleeped.
