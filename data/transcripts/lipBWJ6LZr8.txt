[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   Now, this morning we come back to the book of Ephesians, chapter 5, and I want to invite
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.040]   you to open your Bible to Ephesians, chapter 5.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:19.120]   And we're coming to a very familiar command.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:27.360]   That command is in verse 18: "Be filled with the Spirit."
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.560]   What does that mean?
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.220]   How are we to understand that?
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.960]   How are we to experience it?
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.200]   But let's look at the whole passage, verse 18 through 21.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.800]   I'm going to read them for you.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:54.720]   "Do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.120]   one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.160]   Singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.780]   Always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.820]   the Father.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.400]   And be subject to one another in the fear of Christ."
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.260]   What we have in this command is really the key to all Christian living, the key to all
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.680]   Christian living.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:38.380]   It's only in keeping this command that we can keep any other commands.
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:47.340]   Apart from the truth in this command, which is the heart of Paul's message here, Ephesians
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.040]   would be legalistic.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.240]   Apart from the reality of this command and the work of the Holy Spirit, we would be endeavoring
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:10.000]   to live the Christian life in the flesh, in the strength of our own will, our own power.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.520]   And we have been called to a very high standard.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:22.140]   Back in chapter 4 and verse 1, remember, we have been called to walk worthy, to walk worthy
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.980]   of the calling to which we are called.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.980]   It is a high calling.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.800]   It is a heavenly calling.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.500]   It is a holy calling.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:39.560]   We have been called to become the children of God, to manifest His character in the world.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.020]   That is the highest of all callings.
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.820]   And we are to walk worthy of that calling.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.800]   And what does walk worthy mean?
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.360]   Well, Paul, starting in chapter 4, begins to kind of unpack it for us.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   He says,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.400]   "We are to walk in humility.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   We are to walk in unity.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.500]   We are to walk in righteousness or separation.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.300]   We are to walk in light.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.040]   We are to walk in love.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.340]   We are to walk in wisdom."
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.580]   That is a tall order, to put it mildly.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.580]   But we can't do any of it apart from the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.920]   In fact, chapter 5 and verse 1 says, "We are to be imitators."
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.960]   We are to be imitators of God as beloved children.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.300]   Those are high standards.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:51.300]   And as Jesus said in John 15:5, "Apart from Me, you can do nothing."
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.480]   The way of the flesh is not going to be able to meet those standards.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:06.040]   And so Paul gives us in this simple command in verse 18 the key to Christian living: "Be
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.920]   filled with the Spirit.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.660]   Be filled with the Spirit."
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.640]   Now, Paul knew what he was saying.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.480]   He wasn't there on the day of Pentecost.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.520]   He wasn't there when the Holy Spirit came and the church was established.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.480]   He wasn't there.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.420]   But the fact that he was not there is no indication of what he knew about that great
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.600]   event.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.860]   He surely had all the revelation and all the testimony of the ones that he had met who
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:51.700]   were there to tell them of that great moment on the day of Pentecost when the whole church
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.040]   was born by being filled with the Spirit.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.160]   In Acts, chapter 2, we have the record of that in verse 4.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.300]   "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other languages as
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.880]   the Spirit was giving them utterance."
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:22.340]   And in verse 13 it says, "People were mocking and saying they are full of sweet wine."
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.200]   Sweet wine.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   Sweet wine.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   Sweet wine.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.600]   Sweet wine.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.360]   Sweet wine.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.320]   When the Spirit came on them on the day of Pentecost and filled all 120 believers gathered
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:40.780]   in the upper room on the day of Pentecost, this was the launch of the church, the birth
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:49.300]   of the church, and the inauguration of promises Jesus has made throughout the final days of
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.360]   His ministry that He would send His Holy Spirit who would take up residence in the hearts
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.160]   of His people.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.740]   After He went back to heaven.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.000]   That happened on the day of Pentecost.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.340]   They were filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.940]   Jesus had made those promises.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.180]   Back in chapter 7, He said, "The Holy Spirit is going to come, and He's going to be in
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:23.040]   you, and He's going to be like a river flowing, a living river of life inside of you."
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:31.320]   In the upper room in John 14, 15, and 16, Jesus had said, "The Spirit of truth is going
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320]   to come.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.800]   I'm going to send the Spirit of truth, and when He comes, He will be with you forever."
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.560]   And then He said, "He will be in you."
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.040]   And then in that same encounter with the disciples in the upper room, He also said, "I will be
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   with you forever."
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   Amen.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:01.700]   That He is coming to show you the things concerning Me.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.420]   So the gift of the Holy Spirit was promised by our Lord.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:12.600]   The promise was repeated in John 14, 15, and 16 as He met with His disciples.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.520]   And He said, "The Spirit will be the Spirit of truth.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.600]   He will take up residence in you, and He will teach you the truth concerning Me."
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.360]   This is a glorious reality.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.680]   This means to say that from the day of Pentecost on, every believer in Jesus Christ has had
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.380]   the Holy Spirit living in that believer.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.480]   Even to the Corinthians, Paul says, "Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit."
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.600]   Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   "The Spirit of God is in you," he said in chapter 3.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.140]   "The Holy Spirit is in you," he said in chapter 6.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.820]   So this is a remarkable reality.
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.340]   And He is the Spirit of truth, and He is the Spirit of Christ.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.360]   In Romans, it says in chapter 8 that if any person doesn't have the Spirit of Christ,
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.100]   he doesn't belong to Christ.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.060]   Conversely, anyone who belongs to Christ possesses the Spirit of Christ.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.600]   So if there's anything that describes a Christian, it is the Spirit of Christ.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.720]   It is that, that a Christian is one in whom the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God, the
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.220]   Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth lives permanently.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.080]   It's not something we have to attain.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.900]   It's not something we have to achieve.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:50.160]   It is the reality of salvation, transformation, regeneration, that the very eternal life that
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:59.640]   is in us is because the Spirit of Christ is in us.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:06.780]   That is the only way that we have the capacity to obey the Lord.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:13.220]   In fact, earlier in Ephesians, we noted that He is called the Spirit of promise, because
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:19.720]   everything that the Lord promises us in our obedient walk with Him is in His promise.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.

[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.

[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   He is called the Spirit of promise.

[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:20.300]   The idea of being richly indwelt by the revelation concerning Christ is exactly what it means
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.600]   to be filled, dominated by the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:33.720]   The Spirit's work is to take you to the Scripture, point you to Christ, and as you see the revelation
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:39.620]   of Christ change you from one level of glory to the next, to the next, increasingly more
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:45.380]   like Christ.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.740]   So how do you know when this is happening?
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.740]   How do you know if you're Spirit-filled?
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.460]   Well, it's immediate.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.620]   Go back to Ephesians.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.660]   What happens?
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.660]   Same thing we saw in Colossians.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.720]   The first thing that happens is joyful worship.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:08.280]   "Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.540]   melody with your heart to the Lord."
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:17.020]   This is all internal because you're filled internally.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:21.500]   You're richly indwelt internally.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.140]   And the first thing that happens is joyful worship.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.220]   Literally, you're dominated by it.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.220]   Look at this.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.720]   "Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs."
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.680]   "Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs."
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.000]   Singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.280]   Some of it is public and some of it is private.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.640]   But you're consumed with it.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.840]   How do you know if you're Spirit-filled?
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:58.240]   Because you can't hold back praise, joyful worship of Christ.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   Music.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.780]   What a gift.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.720]   What a gift.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:14.480]   I'm so glad that I am not limited to praise the Lord with the music that I can compose.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:20.140]   This would be the worst of all thoughts.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:32.380]   I am so grateful that I have 2,000 years of praise songs written to Christ, that I can
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.720]   sing.

[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.720]   sing.

[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.720]   sing.

[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.720]   sing.

[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.720]   sing.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.280]   Verse 19 says, "We sing from ado."
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:39.220]   The voice is the primary means, most universal, usable, flexible, and mostly beautiful instrument.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.600]   We sing, and then we make melody, salo.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:49.720]   It means to twang, or to twitch, or to pluck, or to pull.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.280]   This indicates the use of instruments.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.720]   It could actually be translated.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.260]   "Using instruments."
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:01.740]   We sing using instruments.
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:09.880]   But it also says, "We make melody in our hearts."
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:19.800]   We make melody in our hearts, speaking in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.340]   The word "speaking" is very interesting.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.340]   The word "laleo."
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.340]   Lala.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:24.340]   Lala.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.340]   Lala.
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.340]   It's an onomatopoeic word.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:34.140]   It's used of birds whistling, used of people humming.
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.840]   You know how you're filled with the Spirit?
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.180]   You're singing in your heart.
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.640]   You're making sounds.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.840]   You're chirping.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:52.640]   You're whistling, because that's what happens to Spirit-filled people who are dominated
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.960]   by the realities of Christ.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:59.060]   And our songs take three forms at least.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.960]   Some of them are psalms, it says.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.960]   Psalms.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   Again, this connotes what we know about the psalms, and also the use of musical instruments
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.300]   as we're used with the psalms.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:15.040]   Some are hymns.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.980]   Hymns of festal praise to God.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.960]   And some are spiritual songs, or odes, which express humanity.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:22.960]   And some are hymns.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:32.280]   Some express human experience, an ode to something God has done in your life, some gracious gift,
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.060]   or even a sad song.
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.960]   So it's the range of everything.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:48.000]   Psalms, history, theology; hymns, the recognition of God's glory; spiritual songs, personal
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   testimony.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.580]   We sing all of that.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:47:01.500]   But please notice where it is all directed: to the Lord, to the Lord.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:08.220]   Even when we sing together, we sing to the Lord, to the Lord.
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:17.140]   That's where all the praise has to go, to the Lord.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.560]   And we come together as a church and sing.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.200]   We sing to the Lord.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:27.040]   When we sing in our hearts, we sing to the Lord.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.920]   Listen to this outburst in 2 Chronicles 5.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.760]   "When the priests came forth from the holy place, for all the priests who were present
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:43.900]   had sanctified themselves, and all the Levitical singers and their sons and kinsmen, clothed
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:49.160]   in fine linen with cymbals, harps, and lyres, standing east of the altar, and with them
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.200]   a hundred and twenty priests blowing the trumpet.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.200]   The Lord was with them.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   The Lord was with them."
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   What's the difference?
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   The Lord was with them.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.740]   "And the priests blowing trumpets in unison, when the trumpeters and the singers were to
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:05.280]   make themselves heard, with one voice to praise and to glorify the Lord.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.620]   And when they lifted up their voice accompanied by trumpets and cymbals and instruments of
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:15.040]   music, and when they praised the Lord, saying, 'He indeed is good, for His lovingkindness
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:20.820]   is everlasting,' then the house, the house of the Lord was filled with a cloud, so that
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:25.960]   the priests couldn't stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.500]   the house of God."
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:32.900]   Sing like that to Him and He'll show up.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:41.460]   He'll show up, because the psalmist said, "The Lord inhabits the praise of His people."
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.580]   What does it mean to be Spirit-filled?
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:50.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glories of Christ that the Spirit of God is not the
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.440]   only one.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.440]   It means to be so dominated by the glory of the Lord.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.860]   Let Him sing praises.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:12.180]   It's what we do.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.560]   Music is not an evangelistic tool.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.360]   It's not offered for non-Christians.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.580]   It's offered to the Lord.
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:23.720]   And if He's not pleased, He's not pleased because the heart's not right; but if the
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:31.800]   heart is right, it's the most necessary thing that a believer does.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:36.480]   It's wonderful when we come together to do it collectively, but even when you're not
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:41.960]   here, if you're filled with the Spirit and you're dominated with the Word of Christ,
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:47.740]   you're going to be making music to the Lord.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.740]   Joyful worship.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:57.400]   Secondly, thanks for everything, verse 20, "always giving thanks for all things in the
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.280]   name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father."
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   "Thank you, Lord."
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:01.780]   "Thank you, Lord."
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.540]   "Thank you, Lord."
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:08.740]   Thanksgiving is going to be the tone of all that singing.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:14.760]   Joyful praise with thanksgiving.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:20.120]   So that's what it is to have a life under the control of the Holy Spirit, walk in the
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.640]   Spirit.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.080]   It's all the love, joy, peace, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, self-control,
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:31.760]   all the beauties and glories of Christ breaking forth in song.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:44.480]   Now, before you go, I have something that I want to talk to you about.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.100]   Change the subject for a moment.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:54.240]   That is on my heart, and it's very, very important to me, and I need your help with this.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:51:01.740]   So we're watching a culture that is under divine judgment.
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:09.420]   And you can think about that in terms of a culture, or you can realize that the people
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:14.480]   who defy God in the culture are under divine judgment.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.520]   It's very personal.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:23.140]   And it struck me this week in a way that it hadn't in the past.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:30.720]   Governor Gavin Newsom, who has decided that he is going to lead the nation in providing
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   the slaughter of the dead.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.720]   He's said that he's going to lead the nation in providing the slaughter of the dead.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.720]   He's said that he's going to lead the nation in providing the slaughter of the dead.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.720]   I'm going to say that he's going to lead the nation in providing the slaughter of the
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.720]   dead.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.720]   But I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:41.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:46.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:52.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:53.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:15.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:17.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:46.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:48.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   I'm going to say it again.

[00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.720]   I'm going to say it again.

[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:09.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   I'm going to say it again.

[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:22.720]   I'm going to say it again.

[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:33.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:44.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:00.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.720]   What a statement.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:07.660]   Let me read it again.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:16.260]   But to the wicked, God says, "What right have you to tell of My statutes and take My covenant
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:21.400]   in your mouth?
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:29.900]   You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:30.900]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:31.900]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:31.900]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:31.900]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:31.940]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:32.040]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:32.100]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:32.100]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:32.140]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.140]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "You cast My words behind you."
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:42.820]   Now consider this: "I will tear you in pieces, and there will be none to deliver you."
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:47.440]   The jeopardy is clear.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.340]   But there is a closing verse in that Psalm.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:55:01.260]   "He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me, and to him who orders his way aright,
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:01.520]   I shall show my face."
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.520]   I shall show the salvation of God.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:02.520]   I shall show the salvation of God.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:02.520]   I shall show the salvation of God. That Psalm ends with mercy and the offer of salvation.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:02.520]   That Psalm ends with mercy and the offer of salvation.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:16.260]   That Psalm ends with mercy and the offer of salvation.
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:25.140]   And as the church of Jesus Christ, with compassion, we want the governor and all who follow him,
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.360]   and all who reject the Lord, to know that no matter what they have done, He offers salvation.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:26.400]   And as the church of Jesus Christ, with compassion, we want the governor and all who follow him, and all who reject the Lord, to know that no matter what they have done, He offers salvation.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:26.440]   And as the church of Jesus Christ, with compassion, we want the governor and all who follow Him, and all who reject the Lord, to know that no matter what they have done, He offers salvation.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:33.240]   And as the church of Jesus Christ, with compassion, we want the governor and all who follow Him, and all who reject the Lord, to know that no matter what they have done, He offers salvation.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:33.240]   He offers salvation.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.740]   He offers salvation.
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:46.820]   I think with a new kind of resolve, I want to ask you to begin to pray for the salvation of the governor and the people around him.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:50.400]   We can't do anything else.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:55.240]   There's no political solutions to anything.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:55.560]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:55.640]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:55.740]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:55.800]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:55.860]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:56.140]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:56.160]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:56.240]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:56.300]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:56.360]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:56.420]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:56.700]   But we can cry out to the Lord.
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:03.600]   But we can cry out to the Lord. We ask you to pray for the Lord to be merciful, because we care.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:14.320]   This is why the church is in the world, and that He would understand what He has done, that He would turn from sin.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:25.820]   He would repent along with those who accommodate that, follow that, and cry out for mercy from God, who will grant it through Jesus Christ.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:26.160]   Amen?
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.160]   Amen.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.160]   Amen.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:37.520]   Father, we thank You for Your truth, and we boldly proclaim it like those who were filled
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.480]   with the Spirit in Acts 4:31.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:46.720]   It says there that they were filled with the Spirit and boldly proclaimed the word.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:53.740]   We proclaim it boldly from the housetop to all, and You have told us in particular to
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:58.380]   pray for the salvation of rulers and leaders.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:03.580]   So we boldly proclaim the truth of Christ.
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:10.780]   This is our calling in the world, and ask that You would be gracious to those sinners
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:22.680]   in leadership who are in the line of fire for Your judgment, and turn them to repentance
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.680]   and faith in Christ.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:23.680]   Amen.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:29.880]   And provide for them the forgiveness that You give every penitent sinner who comes and
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.500]   calls on Your name.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:40.500]   And Lord, help us to so live that in the midst of a world that is so profoundly troubled,
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:48.140]   our song never ends, the new song of redemption, because we are filled with Your Spirit.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.320]   We ask these things in Christ's name.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:50.780]   Amen.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:51.280]   Amen.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   Amen.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   Amen.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   Amen.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   Amen.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   Amen.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   Amen.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.280]   Amen.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.280]   Amen.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.280]   Amen.
