[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:15.420]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.520]   Excuse me.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.780]   The S&P 500 is still in a 13% drawdown
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.620]   from all time highs.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.120]   Duncan, on this show we are at a new
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.320]   all time high in questions.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.160]   I swear.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.520]   The inbox is just overflowing.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.040]   The Google Doc, remember if you have a question,
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.480]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.320]   - No one took us up on the video or audio question.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.380]   - Nah, it's gonna happen though.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.200]   Someone's gonna do it.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.040]   Yeah, send us a video.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.840]   We'll show it right here on YouTube.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.200]   Today's show is sponsored by Bird Dogs.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.680]   I was excited when Bird Dogs came to us for a sponsorship
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.640]   because I've been wearing these shorts for years.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.140]   I can't remember who got me.
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.320]   Maybe Instagram.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.800]   Someone had an ad and I've been looking
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.160]   because I used to wear khaki shorts all the time
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.740]   and they're uncomfortable.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.800]   There's no stretch to them.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.760]   There's no give.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.720]   You have to iron them so they don't have big creases in 'em
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.680]   and Bird Dogs are just so much more comfortable.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.520]   They're easy.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.960]   They have the liners so you don't even have to wear underwear.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.800]   It's great.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.200]   You can wear them on the beach.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.600]   You can wear them to the gym.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.440]   Doesn't matter.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.240]   Go to birddogs.com/atc.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.480]   You get a promo code ATC.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.840]   It gets you a free Tumblr, right?
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.680]   Pretty good to keep your stuff warm.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.500]   - I forgot mine.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.340]   I meant to have it today to show.
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.180]   - More cold?
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.000]   - But I forgot it.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.840]   - Stock up on those for the summer.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.080]   It's great.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.920]   All right.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.380]   The main line of questions this week was debt default,
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.720]   debt ceiling, these kind of things.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.600]   So let's get into some of those
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.380]   because this is where people are thinking.
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.680]   Some people are saying, "I don't care."
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.580]   Other people are saying, "I'm worried."
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.420]   So let's get into it.
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.460]   Let's do it.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.480]   - Okay, let's do it.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.240]   So up first today, we have a question from Aaron.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.820]   And Aaron writes, "I've recently shifted
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.360]   "a substantial portion of the cash portion of my savings
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.400]   "into three to four month T-bills
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.040]   "to take advantage of higher yields
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.680]   "and state tax advantages.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.640]   "As of today, they are all set to mature
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.200]   "in June and July.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.820]   "I know a U.S. debt default is highly unlikely,
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.180]   "but the risk-averse part of me
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.120]   "is still a little nervous about what would happen
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.420]   "if Congress actually lets the unthinkable happen.
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.280]   "Are my worries misplaced?
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.020]   "What would happen to my treasury investments
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.840]   "if a default did happen?"
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.400]   So this is the big question.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.020]   And yeah, this is what people are kind of
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.860]   starting to freak out about
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.700]   because this date is coming up very quickly.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.540]   So what are your thoughts?
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.880]   - Yeah, this is the right area
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.720]   because there hasn't really been
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.080]   a whole lot of market volatility.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.680]   The market didn't really fall that much.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.180]   And now that we've had a few good headlines
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.020]   the last couple of days,
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.880]   the market has taken off a little bit.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.080]   But this is the one area of the bond market
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.360]   or any financial market that has seen some movement,
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.200]   which is treasury bills.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.080]   So John, give me a chart of one-month T-bill rates
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.960]   versus three-month T-bill rates.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.840]   And what you can see with the one month is
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.760]   at the beginning of April,
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.960]   yields were like 4.75%.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.000]   Three weeks later, they dropped like a rock,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.200]   down to 3.3%.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.960]   Since then, they've taken off like a rocket ship
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.600]   and going from 3.3 to 5.6 in less than a month.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.480]   And you can see comparing to the three-month T-bill,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.020]   which is the purple line there,
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.040]   three-month T-bills have been above one-month T-bills
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.520]   ever since this rate hiking cycle began.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.140]   Now one-month T-bills have shot up
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.160]   above three-month T-bills
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.300]   and you're seeing a ton of volatility there.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.260]   And so what's going on here?
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.460]   I think this is just bond traders positioning
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.700]   for this exact thing that Aaron's talking about.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.540]   Like what if my short-term T-bills happen to mature
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.020]   right when this stuff is going on
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.500]   and maybe I miss a payment or something, right?
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.700]   So I think one of the reasons
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.520]   that the rates crashed in the first place
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.240]   is because people were buying them to get ahead of this
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.360]   and then now they've been selling them
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.400]   and the rates have taken off.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.680]   So obviously the biggest worry here
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.200]   is that both sides don't come to an agreement.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.040]   I think, I really hate the debt ceiling stuff.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.880]   I mean, we can print our own currency.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.720]   And so the people that compare
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.400]   the U.S. government to a household,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.720]   like listen, it's just, it's apples to Mars.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.200]   It's not on the same planet
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.760]   because the U.S. government has the ability
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   to print their own currency.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.480]   So the fact that we put this arbitrary debt ceiling limit
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.880]   makes zero sense to me.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.700]   It's all political posturing.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.700]   I'm not a fan of it.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.160]   It's a crisis that is totally unnecessary,
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.880]   but politicians use it to try to get some negotiating power
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.900]   or leverage or just show that they have some power,
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.800]   I suppose.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.600]   And so there's always the possibility
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.360]   that we don't come to an agreement.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.960]   I do think that even if there's no agreement in place,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.520]   I would be shocked if we missed a debt payment.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.960]   Colin Roche, who's been a two-time guest on this show,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.080]   had good take on this recently.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.200]   He said, "I don't even think you get to a crisis scenario
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.680]   "because the Treasury, President, and Fed
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.740]   "have tools to work around this,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.480]   "and I think they'd be obligated to use those tools.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.560]   "For instance, let's say we get to May 31st
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.880]   "and the Treasury announces it has no money on June 1st.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.360]   "Meanwhile, Congress can't agree on anything.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.600]   "In this case, the President is forced
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.400]   "to invoke the 14th Amendment
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.900]   "to uphold the full faith and credit of the USA.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.220]   "Once we're on the verge of defaulting,
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.400]   "we're breaching the 14th Amendment,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.840]   "which states that it's illegal to default
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.960]   "so we could do some sort of premium bonds
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.260]   "or coin seniorage or selling Treasury assets
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.340]   "or the Fed invoking some crazy circumstances
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.920]   "where they do something."
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.760]   So, there are contingencies and plans on the table.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.440]   Trust me on this.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.480]   So, if a crisis, my whole thinking is,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.840]   if a crisis is on the table and we can avert it,
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.060]   we probably will.
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.360]   Calmer, cooler heads will prevail.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.320]   But I think if it really worries you that much,
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.760]   extend your time horizon out to six or 12-month TPLs,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.560]   the yields aren't really that much worse.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.400]   So, I think that's if you're really,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.000]   so, I don't know, I guess worst-worst-case scenario,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.400]   your payment's delayed by a couple days or a week
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.980]   if we really got bad.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.080]   But I can't see a situation where this kind of thing
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.720]   doesn't get resolved in like 48 hours
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.000]   if it came to an ultimate crisis situation.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.560]   - Yeah, I was reading about this before the show
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.760]   and it's interesting.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.000]   It's a bipartisan thing, though, right?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.800]   Typically, the debt ceiling has been raised historically
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.960]   over and over and over again.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.040]   I can't remember how many times,
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.160]   but a lot of times in the last 50 years.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.240]   - We should just get rid of it.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.120]   It makes no sense to have in place
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.800]   with the way that our system is structured.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   It's just a way for politicians to feel important.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.640]   That's kind of where I fall in.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.040]   - You know what was kind of tripping me up
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.640]   is I was like Zach Galifianakis thinking about this.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.720]   So, the Fed keeps raising rates,
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.800]   so it's making the U.S. government
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.560]   have to pay more on this crazy debt, right?
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.400]   - Yes.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.960]   - So, it's like a loop of making things worse in that regard.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.800]   - A little bit, yeah.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.880]   Interest expense is much higher.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.500]   I got a chart for that for Animal Spirits next week.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.280]   So, again, we have a lot of questions of the debt ceiling,
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.600]   so let's do another one.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.640]   We got another one of those.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.940]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Matt.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.080]   "We are mid-30s.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.440]   "Kiddo is two years old.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.240]   "Kids are expensive, so we have to leave the city.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.840]   "Looking to buy a house in the next year or so.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.800]   "How do we slowly sell out of our brokerage accounts
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.760]   "so that we aren't at the whims of the market
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.880]   "if it crashes during the debt ceiling situation?
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.160]   "I'm worried the market might tank
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   "and we would be forced to wait
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.700]   "until the market rebounds to buy.
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.020]   "However, selling and paying the taxes next year
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.240]   "won't be fun either,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.920]   "plus all the other expenses that come with moving."
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.320]   - You know, last week we talked about
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.280]   moving somewhere cheaper, right?
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.520]   This person's doing just that, which is great.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.720]   At face value, this sounds like a debt ceiling question.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.540]   It's not.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.840]   This is not a debt ceiling question.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.440]   This is an asset allocation,
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.960]   risk profile, and time horizon question.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.160]   Listen, everyone has a different appetite for risk, right?
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.320]   People who take more risk than you,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.920]   you think that they're just irresponsible.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.200]   People who take less risk than you
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.560]   think they're just being wimps, right?
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   This is kind of how it goes,
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.480]   but I invest heavily in equities as a long-term investor,
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.320]   right?
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.200]   I have a very high tolerance for risk
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.760]   when it comes to assets that are five, 10, 15, 20 years
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.600]   into the future.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.480]   Maybe not as high as you, Duncan.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.480]   I'm not in the levered stuff or oat milk penny stocks.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   I don't know.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.000]   - We're not technically a penny stock yet.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   - Okay, not yet.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.240]   We're getting there.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.040]   But when it comes to short and intermediate term goals,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.660]   I'm extremely risk averse.
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.040]   So if I need money next year for a house down payment
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.100]   or a vacation or anything,
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.240]   there's no way in hell that I'm going to be,
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.960]   have that money invested in the stock market.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.800]   No, thank you.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.200]   The downside far outweighs the upside.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.660]   And that downside could come from anything.
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.440]   It could be debt ceiling drama, recession, flash crash,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.140]   the Fed, inflation, anything else
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.560]   that we're not even thinking about right now.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.940]   So John, do a chart on of the rolling one-year returns
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.420]   for the S&P 500.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.840]   I got this 1926 to 1923.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.240]   Do I not have this?
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.200]   Okay.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.400]   Maybe I didn't put this in.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.280]   So what it looks like is on average,
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.480]   the stock market has been up 75% of the time
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.700]   on a one-year basis.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.040]   By the way, that's not John's fault.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.880]   I think I forgot to put it in the doc.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.720]   - Yeah, I was about to say,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.480]   I don't see it in the doc, to be fair.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.320]   - That's on me.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.280]   Whoops.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.540]   Anyway, the point is on a rolling one-year basis,
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.720]   I went back to 1926.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.580]   75% of the time, the S&P 500 has been up on a rolling.
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.820]   Like, that's a pretty good hit rate, right?
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.820]   If you're going to the casino, those odds are great.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.840]   But a one in four chance of loss
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.500]   is not a great probability when it comes
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.880]   to something as important as a house down payment.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.980]   Plus, when stocks were down those one out every four years,
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.780]   on average, they were down 10% or worse
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.740]   more than 52% of the time.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.460]   They were down 20% or worse 25% of the time.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.660]   They were down 30% or worse 12% of the time.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.220]   So I think this person is worried
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.060]   about the wrong things here.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.380]   We're not worried about debt ceiling
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.920]   or tax payments, any of that stuff.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.040]   That stuff's not fun to go through,
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.960]   but you should be worrying about your housing fund
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.640]   losing money at the worst possible time.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.720]   Let's say you have 100 grand saved up
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.320]   for 20% down payment for a $500,000 house, right?
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.360]   I'm just using round numbers here.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.120]   If you're down 10% in a year, you now have $90,000.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.600]   You're down $10,000, right?
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.100]   You're down 20%, you lost $20,000.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.840]   Imagine having a house lined up
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.160]   and realizing you don't have enough money
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.120]   to come up with that down payment.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.760]   So, sure, could this go the other way
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.440]   and stocks are up and you make an extra 5, 10, 15, $20,000
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.660]   if you're lucky, sure.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.460]   But I think you have to weigh the regrets here.
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.700]   And you're right to worry about short-term market volatility
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.180]   but the reason itself doesn't matter.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.100]   So my advice is however you wanna get out,
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.700]   you could do it slowly,
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.140]   but I think having that money in the stock market
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.620]   to begin with for a 12-month goal is pretty irresponsible.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.420]   And I would get it out of the market if I could
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.500]   because I would rather know that money's there
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.740]   and available than take any risk with it.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.600]   - Yeah, and like we've talked about ad nauseum,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.440]   it feels like at this point,
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.600]   but you can actually get something on your cash.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.880]   - Yes, that's the thing.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.120]   People were complaining forever
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.160]   about not being able to earn anything in their cash.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.880]   Now you actually can get something.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.720]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.560]   So again, in my example,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.200]   if you've got $100,000 and you're earning 5%,
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.200]   in a year, you could make an extra $5,000.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.760]   I could cover your closing costs.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.680]   - Right. - Right, so it's, yeah.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.440]   So it's not like a situation
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.680]   where you're being forced out on the risk curve anymore.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.120]   - Yeah, and we'll just ignore the fact
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.400]   that houses will go up another 20% in the next year,
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.500]   you know. (laughs)
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.060]   - Someone looking, but yeah, you're right.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.020]   It's never been easier in the past probably 20 years
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.180]   to find somewhere to park that cash
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.340]   that is not the stock market.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.180]   And the stock market is,
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.580]   you don't wanna be at the whims of the stock market
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.380]   of a flash crash or, you know, in early 2020,
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.660]   the stock market lost 33% in a month, basically.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.740]   I mean, I'm not predicting that's gonna happen,
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.020]   but that's the kind of thing with the stock market
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.460]   that's always there just in case.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.780]   So I would just avoid the stock market
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.700]   for short-term goals like this.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.800]   - I never saw last year coming, you know.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.740]   - Exactly. - Happened overnight.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.580]   - Who knows?
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.820]   All right, next question.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.860]   - Hey, this next one's a fun one from Justin.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.460]   My wife is a middle school math teacher
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.340]   and I've been roped into teaching her students
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.220]   a personal finance one-on-one class
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.700]   during their last week of school.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.040]   That can be brutal, last week of school.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.500]   No one's paying attention.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.340]   But I have a finance degree and consider myself
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.660]   to have sound personal finance practices,
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.860]   but teaching the basics to a group of sixth graders
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.940]   has me a little unsure of where to start.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.620]   What are the best personal finance concepts to teach kids?
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.160]   Some things I have in my agenda,
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.480]   the power of compound interest,
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.080]   the power of diversification,
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.020]   and the importance of savings rate.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.320]   But I'd love to hear how you would approach
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.400]   crafting a 60-minute lesson plan.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.520]   - All right, Justin, I hate to sound harsh here,
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.900]   throw your entire lesson plan out the window right now.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.440]   Sixth graders do not care about diversification
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.280]   or compound interest or the importance of a savings rate.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.360]   Maybe when they're in high school or college, maybe,
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.560]   but at that age, they are not going to care
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.120]   about this stuff.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.040]   I mean-- - Pokemon?
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.640]   Do sixth graders still care about Pokemon?
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.020]   - Well, I think a lot of this stuff doesn't matter
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.880]   until people actually experience it themselves.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.760]   That's why even teaching personal finance in high school
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.560]   probably is just over people's heads in most cases.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.720]   But I do think you could get them interested
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.480]   in business and money in certain ways.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.200]   Like, talk to them about some of their favorite companies
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.120]   and how much money they make and how they make their money.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.440]   Disney, Roblox, Hasbro, Mattel, Nike.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.120]   My oldest daughter has gotten into Roblox lately,
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.280]   and I can see why that-- - I gotta be honest,
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.720]   I still don't even understand what Roblox is.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.560]   I don't think I get it either.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.720]   It's a game, but you have, it's kind of one of these,
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.000]   it's free to play, but then you have to buy stuff
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.280]   on the game, and I'm sure a lot of kids
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.920]   have their parents' credit card numbers
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.240]   and just buy stuff all the time
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.160]   and the parents don't even know it.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.800]   - I love that business model.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.060]   - So I think help these kids understand
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.480]   how companies make money and how they grow,
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.840]   and then maybe that'll help them understand
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.000]   why stock prices grow over time through earnings
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.660]   and these sorts of things and revenue
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.200]   and how a business works.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.040]   Maybe that's more helpful.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.440]   So one of my favorite examples of this for young people
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.440]   was Nike and the original Air Jordans,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.160]   which I just watched air last weekend, which was fantastic.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.320]   The first Air Jordan back in 1985, Duncan,
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.760]   what was the retail price?
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.160]   Not adjusted for inflation or anything.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.060]   What do you think?
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.680]   - $80?
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.600]   - 65, close.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.240]   So if you would have taken that 65,
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.240]   and Justin, I'm giving you this to use in your talk.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.840]   You can take this word for word.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.960]   What if you would have invested that $65
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.520]   instead of buying the shoes and wearing them out
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.800]   and throwing them away in a year,
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.480]   what if you would have instead invested in Nike shares?
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.260]   All right, John, throw the chart up here.
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.760]   That $65 grew into $61,000.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.740]   It was over a hundred before,
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.240]   but Nike has fallen down a little bit.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.480]   Obviously extreme example,
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.040]   but this just does a nice job of illustrating
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.740]   the difference between spending money and investing money.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.720]   So I think the idea of compounding
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   is an important concept to grasp.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.560]   But again, I don't think these kids are gonna latch on
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.200]   to 10% growth in the stock market over 30 years.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.520]   I don't think that's gonna help.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.880]   So Duncan, have you heard the rice story before?
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.280]   Maybe this is a good way.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.760]   So there's the old story about back in the medieval days,
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.640]   we're talking like when "Game of Thrones" happened,
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.920]   right, whenever that was.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.880]   And there's a king who likes chessboards
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.560]   and a con artist is really good at making chessboards,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.200]   right, and he goes to the king
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.560]   and he's selling him chessboards and he realized,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.040]   oh, this king knows nothing about math.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.560]   So he says, instead of giving me gold
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.800]   or fine clothes or whatever,
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.360]   how about you just give me enough rice
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.180]   where we start with one piece of rice
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.840]   on the first square of the chessboard
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.320]   and then we double it every time.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.000]   So one, two, four, eight, 16, that sort of thing.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.400]   And the king has all this rice.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.520]   He says, that sounds great.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.400]   So it doubles and it's pretty small.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.160]   But then by the 20th square, I think or something,
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.580]   it's over a million grains of rice.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.640]   By the 30th square, it's over 500 million.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.800]   By the 40th, it's like a trillion grains of rice.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.280]   How many other chessboards, 60 something?
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.400]   - I actually don't remember.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.840]   And I should know that, I play chess.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.280]   - And so then the con artist says,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.120]   don't worry about the rice.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.140]   You can just pay me in gold or land
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.620]   after he is up to trillions of grains of rice.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.460]   - Sorry, Michael just walked in, so I'm a little distracted.
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.220]   - Okay, he's been known to do that.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.640]   I don't know.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.540]   So I'm saying use stories to talk about these concepts
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.540]   as opposed to giving people facts and figures and numbers
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.780]   and talking about the stock market.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.180]   So I do like the idea of teaching young people
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.780]   the importance of money and personal finance, but...
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.820]   - Hey, Michael.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.800]   He's got a lot of gear on there.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.560]   But I mean, try to tell them stories
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.400]   that they're gonna remember,
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.320]   not just numbers and facts and figures,
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.760]   because most of them is gonna go in one ear and out the other
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.240]   and especially if it's towards the end of the year.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.160]   So teach them some stories, maybe they'll remember
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160]   and share with their parents.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.740]   Most adults find this stuff boring too.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.600]   I love finance and investing and all this stuff,
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.440]   but most people find it boring, even as adults.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.400]   So kids are gonna find it even more.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.500]   So I would figure out a way to talk about stories
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.040]   as opposed to numbers.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.740]   - Right. - That's what I would...
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.580]   - When I was in sixth grade,
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.100]   I think you would have had to put it in skateboarding terms
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.380]   for me to have paid attention probably.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.220]   - You were a skater?
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.960]   Did you have the hair over the face kind of deal too?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.820]   - No, not really, no.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.660]   - Okay.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.300]   - I did have longer hair, but yeah, not like that.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.620]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.620]   - All right, up next we have a question from Alex.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.420]   I'm contributing to my 401k plan,
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.460]   50% traditional before tax and 50% Roth after tax.
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.780]   I'm currently 31 years old
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.120]   and I like the idea of tax diversification now
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.840]   and in retirement.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.520]   What happens once I reach retirement age
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.840]   from a tax standpoint?
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.320]   Where would I roll the balances to
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.560]   and how do distributions work?
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.920]   Do I have control over which bucket I pull from,
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.180]   Roth or traditional,
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.160]   or will there be forced pro rata taxation
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.080]   on all distributions?
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.360]   - Good financial planning question here.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.960]   See, the thing is, I think a lot of people realize
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.120]   like making the contributions is a lot easier.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.480]   Obviously saving some people is difficult,
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.120]   but making contributions is way easier
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.960]   than taking out withdrawals.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.180]   And this is where financial planning comes in.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.620]   So why don't we bring on a financial planner here,
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:45.580]   Alex Palumbo.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.740]   - Hey, Alex.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.340]   - Hi, Ben, hold in your enthusiasm introducing me.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.340]   Seriously, it's okay.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.980]   (laughs)
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.820]   - All right.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.900]   - And I prefer if you refer to me
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.260]   as director of attire for today, if that's okay.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.220]   - Come in, hi.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.180]   - May I explain why?
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.020]   Is that okay?
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.340]   So, because Michael with the impromptu cameo
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.900]   recommended yesterday on your show,
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.620]   Animal Spirits #Plug, that it's now Hawaiian shirt season.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.320]   You have to wear Hawaiian shirts now every day.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.060]   So me, being an avid listener and follower,
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.060]   leave my apartment complex today in a Hawaiian shirt.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.900]   It's 50 degrees, it's freezing out there.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.860]   So what I do, I scramble.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.060]   I throw on this fakakta raggedy polo,
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.540]   and I shouldn't have done that.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.220]   So second plug, what I should do is pick up
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.140]   a lovely polo from Bird Dogs.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.980]   They ship on June 15th highest quality polo shirt
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.300]   on the market. - You do look nice.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.060]   - But mine was dirty, so I'm wearing this raggedy one.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.940]   - Alex, you can be my salesman anytime.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:43.780]   - So there you go.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.820]   - This is why you're not the director of attire though,
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.860]   because you didn't check the weather
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.100]   before we left the house today.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.380]   It's gotta be sunny if you're gonna wear a Hawaiian shirt.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.860]   - All I listen to is Michael Batnick
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.740]   and whatever he says, I just do, blindly.
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.500]   - Maybe you're more of a director of retire.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.620]   (laughs)
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.740]   - All right. - Nice.
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.980]   - So Alex is in his 30s, and he's already thinking ahead
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.100]   pretty far down the line.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.260]   But this is obviously something older people
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.820]   that are in retirement have to think about more.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.060]   So by the time he gets their taxes and RMDs and stuff,
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.140]   the rules are probably gonna be different.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.580]   But how do you think about portfolio withdrawals
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.140]   when you have a client coming to you and saying,
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.340]   "Hey, I've got this money in a 401k and this in an IRA
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.940]   "and this in a taxable account."
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.220]   How do you think about it in terms of asset location
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.500]   and where they should be taking money from
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.260]   and planning out those withdrawal strategies?
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.820]   'Cause again, that's way more difficult
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.740]   than it is to put money in.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.980]   Putting money in is easy.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.140]   Taking it out can be difficult
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.020]   because you have to think about all these moving pieces.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.140]   - Yeah, it's a good point.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.380]   It's a great question from Alex, excellent question.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.660]   So I think it's actually a great idea to diversify
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.780]   the traditional and Roth contributions to your 401k.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.540]   Now to establish the basics, when you establish pre-tax,
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.900]   you're not paying taxes on those contributions.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.540]   You defer it until when you retire and you take distributions
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.500]   from the traditional 401k.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.020]   It's taxed at ordinary income rates,
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.220]   the opposite with the Roth.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.700]   You're paying ordinary income rates now,
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.060]   but then all of that growth is tax-deferred,
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.700]   not tax-deferred, it's tax-free,
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.740]   and then you never pay taxes upon the distributions.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.780]   So that sort of answers this first part of this question,
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.900]   what happens when I retire?
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.140]   Sort of acts the exact opposite of how you contributed.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:19.380]   And I do like the idea of overall 50/50 diversification
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.300]   for sure.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.620]   There's obviously more nuances though.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.340]   Like if you're in the highest income tax bracket right now,
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.700]   should you use a Roth?
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.220]   I know Bill Sweet would probably say yes,
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.140]   and I wouldn't disagree,
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.300]   versus if you're in the lowest income tax bracket right now,
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.780]   I would definitely not use a traditional
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.700]   'cause you wanna take advantage
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.260]   of that very low income tax bracket.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.100]   - I guess that's the point.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.380]   He's not gonna be able to plan it out now,
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.220]   but when he gets there,
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.380]   having that diversification will help
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.140]   because you don't know what your spending's gonna be
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.020]   at that point.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.300]   You don't know what the tax rates are gonna be.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.580]   So maybe having that diversification can allow you
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.620]   to think through what the best bucket is to take from
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.220]   at the time instead of being pigeonholed
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.100]   into one bucket or the other.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.940]   - It definitely adds a lot of flexibility.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.780]   So now you'll have a Roth bucket, a traditional bucket,
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.180]   and then potentially like a non-qualified trust
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.100]   or brokerage bucket,
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.820]   and you can sort of play the flexibility tax game,
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.340]   which we do with our clients all the time,
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.940]   and it just saves our clients so much in taxes
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.540]   in terms of short-term distribution tax planning,
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.380]   and then long-term planning as well.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.020]   To answer Alex's like very quick,
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.300]   more straightforward questions,
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.660]   you would roll the balances into an IRA from a 401k,
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.500]   unless from age 55 to 59 1/2,
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.900]   you can actually take distributions penalty-free
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.420]   from your 401k, and you cannot do that from your IRA.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.740]   Duncan, did you know that?
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.900]   - Right, so if he retires early,
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.620]   he's got some avenues beyond the taxable account.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.060]   - So I had a client retired at age 55.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.260]   Instead of rolling over his entire 401k to an IRA,
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.300]   we kept a few years worth of basic living expenses
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.500]   in that 401k.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.060]   So that's a pretty important four-year window
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.820]   'cause that's a pretty common retirement age.
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.660]   And then the question,
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.100]   do I have control over which bucket I pull from?
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.340]   There's no such thing as pro-rata distributions.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.900]   You can pull fully from the traditional or the Roth,
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.740]   a ton of flexibility,
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.660]   which is really one of the main benefits we discussed.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.620]   - Yeah, so having some diversification here
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.860]   is probably not a bad decision.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.460]   - For sure.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.300]   - I like it.
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.060]   Okay, let's do another one.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:16.900]   - Okay.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.020]   So last but not least, we have a question from Robert.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.340]   With the SBB collapse,
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.480]   a ton of employees lost money
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.500]   on employee stock option plans.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.580]   How much of your net worth should be in your employer's stock?
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.500]   5%, 10%, 20%?
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.980]   And this is one I'm sure a lot of people have after that,
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.160]   because a lot of these tech companies,
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.500]   that's how they compensated people, right?
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.360]   - The funny thing is, is that a few years ago,
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.380]   people were asking this question differently.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.740]   Like, why shouldn't I go all in on my stock company?
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.820]   Now people are saying, maybe I should diversify.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.140]   So Alex, you've had plenty of clients come to you
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.220]   over the years who made good money
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.900]   in concentrated portfolios.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.420]   So let's talk about stock options
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.860]   and some of the thought process behind this here.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.420]   - For sure, this is a super relevant topic.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.300]   And I think for starters, we could do a primer
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.860]   on really the four most common types
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.660]   of employer and employee stock plans.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.520]   Big John, give me the PowerPoint.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.060]   - This is our first ever PowerPoint slides
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.180]   on Ask the Compound.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.380]   So Alex, giving you a lot of leeway here.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.660]   You did a rant on clothing
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.140]   and now you're doing a PowerPoint.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.420]   - You're gonna absolutely love it.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.700]   So there's really four different types.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.060]   Restricted stock units, employee stock ownership plans,
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.380]   employee stock option plans,
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.300]   and then employee stock purchase plans.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.580]   We're gonna go through each in like 15 to 30 seconds
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.620]   'cause I think it's important to establish the difference.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.700]   RSUs are the most common one that I see
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.540]   because they're the most simplistic.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.300]   Very straightforward, when you're granted units,
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.340]   let's say 100 units of ABC stock,
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.200]   there's no tax nature at all.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.460]   Then once they vest to you,
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.180]   that is taxed at ordinary income.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.540]   So you get 100 shares at $100 a share,
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.720]   you have to pay $10,000 of ordinary income.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.400]   Then when you sell it, you pay capital gains.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.500]   Boom, easy to understand.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.340]   Next.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:08.100]   Employee stock ownership plans, Duncan, you still with me?
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:08.940]   - Yes.
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.700]   - The ownership plans is when the employer contributes.
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.220]   So your employer is just giving you money.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.060]   It's great.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.420]   It goes into a pre-tax account,
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.660]   and then when you wanna take distributions,
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.600]   it's taxed at ordinary income rates to you.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.980]   If you wanna defer that, you can roll it into an IRA,
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.780]   but this is where NUA, net unrealized appreciation,
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.020]   comes into play.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.900]   We're not gonna go into that,
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.500]   but that's a very important concept.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.340]   Next big job.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.180]   - You got three exclamation points there,
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.180]   so it has to be important.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.980]   - NUA is absolutely huge.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.440]   I think actually on my first appearance,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.740]   we went over NUA a little bit.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.740]   The third one is a little bit more complex.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.620]   It's employee stock options.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.220]   There's two types, NQSOs and ISOs.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.860]   We're gonna only focus on NQSOs.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.340]   They're a little bit more common.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.340]   Not taxed when you're granted.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.900]   They're not even taxed when they vest.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.700]   Duncan, can you believe it?
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.140]   - Sounds too good to be true.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.500]   - They're only, but there is a kicker,
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.080]   some caveats, and some risks.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.260]   They're only taxed when you exercise them.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.700]   So the difference between the strike price
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.380]   and the market value, that's taxed.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.260]   And then subsequent sales are sort of taxed,
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.500]   like capital gains.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.960]   And that bargain element is taxed at ordinary income.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.100]   But these can be completely worthless.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.300]   They can just expire worthless.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.340]   We'll get into that later.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.980]   Last one, big job.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.660]   An employee stock purchase play.
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.880]   These shares, pretty much you have to buy these shares.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.600]   So it's sort of where you're buying something
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.820]   and you're not just giving it.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.580]   And you typically get a five to 15% discount
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.140]   on the market value.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.980]   And you purchase it with post tax dollars.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.900]   - And these are usually a publicly traded corporation,
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.940]   right, where you get a,
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.140]   it could be Walgreens or something like it, or Pepsi.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.420]   You can buy it at a 10 or 15% discount
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.380]   and you can do it on a set basis, right?
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.260]   - When you do that, is there a lockup?
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.020]   Because otherwise, wouldn't people just arbitrage that
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.080]   and immediately sell it for a profit?
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.380]   - I have no idea what Duncan means.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.420]   - If you're getting a discount when you buy the stock
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.600]   from your own company,
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.980]   if you're immediately getting a 15% discount,
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.700]   could you not just sell it on the open market?
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.000]   - Absolutely amazing question.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.020]   It's almost like this next slide completely answers that.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.180]   - Okay, let's see it.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.820]   - So a little bit intricate here, but stay with me.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.060]   I think I'll be able to explain it.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.740]   So this is how it typically goes.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.060]   First, Duncan, you're offered the stock
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.940]   at let's say $10 a share,
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.900]   but you cannot purchase it until a year later.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.780]   And let's say the purchase price is $20.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.040]   Then in order to have a qualifying disposition,
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.780]   you have to sell it two years after it was offered, right?
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.520]   So that's how it sort of answers your question, Duncan.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.800]   And let's say the stock at that point is $30.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.880]   Now to be a qualifying disposition,
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.680]   that discount that you paid, right Duncan,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.240]   because it was worth $10, but you only paid 8.50 for it,
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.360]   that discount is taxed at ordinary income.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.560]   There's no free lunch here.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.520]   Of course you're gonna get taxed at ordinary income.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.680]   But the rest of that game,
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.300]   and I thought that this is like, this is a pretty big deal.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.500]   That entire amount from 10 to 30
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.480]   is taxed at long-term capital gains.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.980]   So even though you purchased it at 20,
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.340]   you pay long-term capital gains from 10 to 30.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.180]   That's huge.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.620]   A disqualifying disposition is
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.040]   if you don't follow those rules,
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.740]   you pay ordinary income tax on pretty much everything,
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.700]   except for the discount.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.540]   - Get these numbers out of here.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.440]   - Yeah, get these numbers out of here.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.300]   - All right, but so that makes sense.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.780]   So Duncan's question was, there is no free lunch here.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.620]   - Right, and so you go from paying $22
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.060]   of ordinary income tax
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.660]   to only $1 of ordinary income tax.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.500]   That's a big difference.
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.460]   - This is why financial planners exist,
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.920]   because this stuff is complicated.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.760]   - Right.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.520]   - All right, back to the original question.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.360]   How much should you have?
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   You've had people come to you
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.920]   with concentrated positions in the past,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.080]   probably anywhere from 5% to,
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.720]   what's as high as you've seen?
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.560]   80% maybe?
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.840]   - 5% to 100%, it's a huge range.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.000]   - I know we've had people with 90% of the net worth
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.320]   in their company's stock.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.680]   And they know in their heart of hearts,
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.080]   they need to diversify.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:03.920]   Some people are worried,
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.640]   well, I could be leaving money on the table.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.080]   But how do you think about this idea
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.080]   of still making money in the stock
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.480]   versus reducing your risk and spreading your bets?
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.680]   - Yeah, first thing I say is,
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.300]   typically, your entire career is tied
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.540]   from an income perspective to the company, right?
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.100]   They're the ones paying your salary.
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.760]   So if you own 100% of your portfolio,
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.540]   or really any of it, of your investable assets,
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.680]   you're doubling down.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.280]   That's the first thing I'd like to mention.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.080]   The employee client typically knows more
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.580]   about the company than I do,
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.220]   but they're inherently a little bit more biased.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.580]   I've seen clients with an employee stock ownership plan
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.980]   in oil and gas companies, multiple clients that I have,
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.300]   they pretty much have their entire net worth
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.860]   in this company, and now they have millions of dollars.
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.540]   I've had clients who had RSUs in the regional banks
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.140]   that you mentioned, and they had 200K drop to zero now.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.540]   And that's a disaster.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.980]   I had a client who had options
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.220]   that were worth about $5 million.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.020]   Now they're worthless,
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.940]   'cause you can't even exercise the options.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.660]   So I've seen the whole gamut of clients who work at Google,
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.220]   and their RSUs are just steadily vesting,
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.500]   and they're performing better than a lot of the market.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.000]   So I've seen the whole gamut.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.380]   There are certain strategies you can implement, though.
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.740]   Like, for example, it's all about the person.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.360]   If you wanna take more risk, how about this, Duncan?
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.920]   When the stock goes down a lot,
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.280]   sometimes people have the options
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.320]   to choose between stock options and RSUs.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.380]   You can maybe switch a little bit more to options
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.500]   when the stock goes down a lot.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.920]   That's obviously a risky proposition,
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.560]   'cause options can be worthless.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.340]   But when it goes up, you have that leverage component,
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:42.020]   which is why Duncan, of course, loves that option.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.860]   And there's everywhere in between.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.680]   - Duncan's middle name is Risk.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.520]   He would like this one.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.160]   - So RSUs are always gonna be worth something, typically,
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.340]   and options can easily be worthless.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.860]   - I do think, obviously, the level is a comfort thing,
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.140]   but I don't know.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.820]   I think anything more than 10 to 20%
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.860]   is probably a little irresponsible.
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.940]   I would say that that's a pretty good line in the sand.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.620]   - 20% seems high.
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.460]   - Yes, right.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.600]   - But tell that to someone who's been working at Google
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.440]   for the past 10 years.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.780]   - I do agree with you that you work for the company,
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.180]   you probably become a little overconfident,
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.020]   and it's gonna be harder for you
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.100]   to see the potential downside.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.580]   But if you were someone who worked at General Electric
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.300]   and you were the biggest company in the S&P 500 in 2000,
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.760]   you wouldn't expect your stock to fall 75%
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.740]   over the next 20 years or whatever it is,
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.340]   and just be decimated.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.460]   So that's what you're trying to protect against.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.280]   - It's just like what you said earlier.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.520]   - And back to Justin for question three,
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.100]   for teaching the kids.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.660]   - Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.660]   Right, that's it, easy.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.500]   Easy story.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.340]   - And what you said earlier,
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.460]   it's like people don't understand risk
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.820]   until they live through it.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.640]   - Yes.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.480]   - It's unfortunate.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.660]   - It's regret minimization.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.140]   Okay, all right.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.300]   Alex, you're fired as director of retire for,
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.860]   sorry, for not wearing the right shirt today.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:51.700]   - Oh my God.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.460]   - Next time director of retire.
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.740]   Thank you for having me.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:55.580]   - Yeah. - Thanks, Alex.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.400]   - As always, yep.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.240]   Remember, you can email us,
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.820]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.

[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.980]   ATC is the code.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.540]   Remember, also free to send us a voice memo or a video.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.220]   We're gonna play these one of these times.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.240]   Happy to personalize this.
