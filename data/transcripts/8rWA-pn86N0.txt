[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   - Happy Friday everyone.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.140]   A podcast listener named Lauren Belozian
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.680]   writes in to ask about confessional Christianity.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.360]   Dear Pastor John, I'm a fan of your podcast.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.040]   My question is this.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.040]   Do you subscribe to the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith?
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.760]   If not, why not?
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.700]   And in general, what are your thoughts
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.120]   on the confessional movement and associations?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.880]   What would you say, Pastor John, to Lauren?
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.480]   - Well, before I declare myself with regard
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.060]   to the 1689 Baptist Confession,
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.440]   just some general thoughts,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.560]   some encouraging, hopeful thoughts
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.960]   about confessional Christianity.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.720]   I think confessional Christianity,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.920]   Christianity that's unified
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.480]   around a written confession of faith,
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.140]   confessional Christianity at its best
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.400]   is the best Christianity.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.480]   In other words, all other things being equal,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.140]   it is a good thing for a people to be united
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.600]   around a written summary of biblical truth.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.320]   And I've got, I think, maybe four reasons
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.220]   that come to mind why that is.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.220]   One, Paul, when he was saying farewell
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.640]   to the elders in Ephesus, declared,
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.100]   "I am innocent of the blood of you all
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.680]   "because I did not shrink from declaring to you
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.060]   "the whole counsel of God."
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.940]   So that phrase, whole counsel of God,
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.200]   points to some kind of unified summary
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.300]   of essential biblical truth.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.100]   And Paul said to Timothy in another place,
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.220]   similarly, I think it's 1 Timothy 6.20,
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.320]   "Guard the deposit entrusted to you."
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.140]   So there's some kind of deposit,
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.400]   an apostolic deposit that's put down
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.200]   that you should guard and hand on.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.800]   So some kind of body of unified truth.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.780]   Same thing in Romans 6.17, Paul said,
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.100]   "You who were once slaves of sin
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.640]   "have become obedient from the heart
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.240]   "to the standard of teaching
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.040]   "to which you were committed."
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.040]   So we've got the phrase standard of teaching,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.380]   deposit, whole counsel of God,
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.520]   and those all to me say,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.080]   all right, have you done that, John Piper?
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.420]   Did you deliver to Bethlehem Baptist Church
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.800]   the whole counsel of God?
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.520]   Is there a deposit of truth that you gave there?
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.000]   And I think that points us towards,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.200]   yeah, we need something like that
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   summarized or written down for us.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.160]   The second thing is that
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.240]   without a written summary of biblical truth,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.520]   we tend to be vague about what we believe.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.840]   Some people think that avoiding confessions of faith
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.060]   provides greater Christian unity
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.360]   because writing things down requires precision
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.520]   and clarity and explicitness,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.520]   and all of those precipitate disagreement and arguments.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.540]   But the alternative is to obscure those disagreements
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.840]   under a cloud of vagueness.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.480]   And the effect of that so-called unity
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.640]   is that it constantly depends on keeping
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.520]   clarity of truth at a distance.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.600]   You can't see it with precision up close,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.520]   and it lets you down in the end
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.880]   when crucial applications and decisions
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.800]   have to be made on the basis of truth,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.120]   and it's now been kept obscure all this time,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.120]   and we don't have it there to apply in crucial cases.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.960]   The third reason I think it's important
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.440]   to have something like a summary of biblical truth
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.640]   or a confession is that
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.440]   the slogan, "No creed but the Bible,"
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.440]   conceals the fact that in almost any group,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.640]   crucial biblical statements will be properly understood
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.600]   by some and misunderstood by others.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   In such cases, it's naive to say that the Bible unites us.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.400]   It may not be uniting us at all.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   It may be instead a vague cloak for significant disunity,
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.360]   and that doesn't honor the scriptures.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   It was a great education for me
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.720]   to do a study of Athanasius and realize
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.240]   that in the debates that he had with the heretic Arius,
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.480]   both sides affirmed the authority of scripture,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   and both sides did extensive quoting of the Bible.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.000]   And so, "No creed but the Bible," in that case,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.320]   would simply be used to cover the fact
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.360]   that the denial of the deity of Christ doesn't matter.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.640]   Of course it matters, and somebody has to stand up and say,
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.160]   "That's not what the Bible teaches."
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.720]   And the fourth reason for why I think
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.280]   the confessional movement is a good thing
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.280]   is that such confessional summaries of biblical truth
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.160]   really do help us in our faith,
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.160]   because I think faith thrives on deep, true doctrine
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.320]   that is brought out of the scriptures,
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   properly summarized, applied to people's lives,
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.440]   and in our souls, in our families, in our churches,
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.000]   even in society.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.200]   That kind of clear doctrinal truth
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   is healthy for life and for obedience to Jesus.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.360]   I know that there will always be Pharisaic misuses
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.800]   of doctrine, of biblical truth,
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.720]   which turn them into a vehicle of pride
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.560]   and abuse of God's people,
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.080]   but those kinds of misuses of truth
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.840]   should not stop us from the right use of truth,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.600]   which is to treat it like kindling,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.560]   thrown on the fires of love for God and love for people.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.480]   That's the way it's functioned in my life
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.400]   over the years anyway,
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.200]   that clear, faithful, doctrinal teaching
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   has been an inflaming means to my faith
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.340]   and my love for God and love for people.
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.800]   So yes, I'm in favor of churches and schools
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.280]   and ministries being defined
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.400]   by robust affirmations of faith.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.000]   One of the practical effects that had on me
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.560]   was after about 15 years
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.260]   of my serving Bethlehem Baptist Church,
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.920]   the elders then, with my encouragement,
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.680]   worked their way for about four or five years
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.180]   to the point of composing and agreeing upon
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.180]   the Bethlehem Baptist Church Elder Affirmation of Faith.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.680]   And that affirmation of faith now governs the church
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.360]   and Desire in God and Bethlehem College and Seminary.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.160]   And there are advantages and disadvantages
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.380]   of composing a new affirmation of faith.
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.880]   I realize there are dangers.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.080]   The great danger is that we might be trendy
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.600]   or idiosyncratic or selective,
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.840]   based on our own preferences.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.520]   The advantage is that it can be expressed in language
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.560]   that is more understandable
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.680]   and can deal with issues and terms
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.340]   that we're facing today that need to be dealt with
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.320]   doctrinally and ethically.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.040]   So we tried very hard not to be trendy or idiosyncratic.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.680]   And we tried to send out the affirmation of faith
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.400]   in its process of coming into being
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.680]   to Christian leaders across the country and get feedback.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.120]   So that was our approach.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.880]   Now, here's the deal with the 1689 Baptist Confession.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.840]   I didn't choose to go that route,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   even though it's a good, solid, reformed Baptist version
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.040]   of the Westminster Confession.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.360]   And there are several reasons why.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.200]   Here they are.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.800]   Number one, the language is somewhat foreign.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.540]   And its vocabulary, it uses King James.
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.880]   It's like reading the King James Version.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.320]   And I think it's probably a mistake
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.320]   to try to enshrine that today
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.800]   as the one that, if you expect families to use it
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.640]   without any updated form.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.360]   So that was one reason.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.800]   Number two, while I'm able to affirm
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.280]   that Genesis 1 referred to literal 24-hour days,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   I had a hard time thinking that I should make that
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.480]   a matter of confessional faithfulness to Christianity.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.000]   And so I stumbled over that section.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.120]   Third, the understanding of the Sabbath
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.120]   is perhaps more rigorous and narrow
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.360]   than my understanding of the implications
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.040]   of Jesus' teaching about the Sabbath.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.180]   Fourth, there are certain historic categories of theology,
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.080]   like the covenant of works and others,
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.960]   that have proved useful, but you might wonder,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.320]   shall I make that the structure
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.920]   of the theology I'm going to present?
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.640]   A fifth idea was that there are little things,
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.280]   I mean, this is gonna sound so piddly,
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.880]   and yet you can't be piddly in a confession,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.880]   little things like saying that bread and wine
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.840]   are prescribed in the Lord's Supper.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.320]   Nowhere in the New Testament does it say
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.640]   that wine was used in the Lord's Supper.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.800]   That comes as a shock to a lot of people.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.760]   It doesn't say that's what was used.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.440]   Now, I suspect it was, I suspect it was wine,
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.440]   but it always uses the term cup or fruit of the vine,
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:15.160]   and therefore, if you get into a knockdown battle
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.520]   and say, we're gonna settle this confessionally,
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.280]   and you go to a 1689 confession,
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.160]   it's gonna say wine is what you're supposed to use.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.720]   And I would say, well, that's just unbiblical,
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.640]   because that's not what the Bible says,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.760]   even though that's totally legitimate
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.400]   and maybe even preferable, but not at all required.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.440]   So I think the 1689 confession of faith
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.040]   is a glorious, wonderfully faithful expression
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.520]   of biblical truth.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.800]   I fellowship down to my toenails with people
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.280]   who love that doctrine, but there are enough
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.360]   little things and things like I've mentioned here
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.280]   that made me think, I think probably for us,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.880]   we would wanna go another direction.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.320]   But my main point here that I wanna say
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.720]   and leave Lauren with is, I think affirmations of faith
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.540]   are very important, and that churches should not shy away
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:17.540]   from them, but patiently, over time, work their way
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.760]   towards a unified expression of biblical faith
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.200]   for the sake of the preservation and the vitality
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.120]   and the mission of the church.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.480]   - A hearty amen to that, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.980]   And I can hear follow-up emails piling in already
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.440]   in the inbox about creation and Sabbath and wine.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.200]   - So can I, oh my, what have I done?
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.040]   - All right, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.240]   Well, if you wanna see the Bethlehem Baptist Church
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.160]   Elder Affirmation of Faith, you can find that
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.880]   at desiringgod.org, it's a beautiful document,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.280]   and I know many churches have adopted it as their own.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.160]   You can check it out online.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.400]   Well, we're gonna break for the weekend,
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.880]   and we are back on Monday with a fascinating discussion
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.560]   on the differences between praising others
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.160]   and flattering others.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.800]   You don't wanna miss this one.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.440]   And if you've missed any episodes from the week,
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.600]   you can catch up in our free app for your phone,
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.720]   and of course, you can catch up online
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.440]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, have a wonderful weekend.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
