[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.620]   All right, we're continuing, Melissa and I are continuing the conversation that we began
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.540]   the other day.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:18.380]   I am talking with Melissa Ellison, homeschool mom with experience, which is also always
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.420]   such a valuable thing to say to people who wonder how in the world am I ever going to
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.420]   do this?
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.660]   And I'm so pleased to hear Melissa from people who have done it and survived and have a little
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.140]   bit of experience under their belt.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.880]   What you were telling me just a few minutes ago was that community has been a big part
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.060]   of an important and big part of your homeschool journey.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.480]   And I imagine that this good community plays into the next question I'm going to ask you,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.460]   but I think that your answer to this question might set a lot of early homeschoolers minds
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.460]   at risk.
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420]   Okay, I want to ask you this.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:15.660]   How do you think a classical education has impacted your kids or prepared them for life?
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:26.420]   That's a loaded question, and I want you to answer really honestly.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:36.220]   I think I have to admit that at first, once they got to that dialectic stage and they
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:45.140]   were wrestling with ideas and making things their own, I struggled a little bit with that
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.360]   because it's a little scary because you're like, "What if they don't have the same values
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   or opinions or whatever?
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.420]   They don't come to the same conclusions as you do."
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.680]   And so that was a practice in trusting God, too, with them.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.220]   So I think as far as preparing my kids, the biggest things that I've seen with my children
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.800]   are they love to learn, at least most of them.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.380]   They just love to learn, and they're continually learning.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:34.300]   I remember, too, when they went to college, they were so much more prepared for presentation
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.300]   wise.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.320]   I mean, they weren't nervous getting up in front of a class.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.860]   They were very well-spoken.
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.660]   They were confident.
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.940]   And I even remember Sarah in high school being part of the young Republican committee or
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.740]   whatever in our county, and she went and spoke for a couple of candidates for a local state
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.540]   elections and people would be like, "Aren't you nervous?"
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.580]   And I mean, she literally would almost just get up there, not even have to prepare that
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.740]   much, and she was not nervous and very well-spoken and loved it because it was a passion of hers
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:22.700]   because she ended up going to Patrick Henry and majoring in political science.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.740]   So that was something that she loved.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.460]   And so that was a big thing that I saw.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.580]   And also, they knew how to find answers.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:39.220]   They knew how to research, how to find an answer for something, and knew how to read
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.500]   original documents, which a lot of kids don't know anymore how to do.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:56.460]   And then, too, I think being able to be confident in what they believe and being able to convey
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.380]   that to others.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:07.300]   I see that a lot, especially with even my youngest child, who is just very on fire for
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.300]   God.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.860]   And he is not ashamed of the gospel, which is a beautiful thing, right?
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.900]   But he talks to other people, and he is not.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.540]   And he can express himself, and he has a passion, and you just don't see that a lot, I don't
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.540]   think, with kids.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.220]   You know, they're swayed by other kids, they're swayed by, you know, and they don't know what
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.220]   they believe.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.260]   And so I think that's one of the biggest things.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.460]   Gosh, that is such a great thing.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.100]   Amen, sister.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.540]   What a blessing for families who are just beginning the homeschool journey.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.280]   I understand that for a lot of us, when we start, it's about academics.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.820]   We wonder, "Can I teach a child to read?"
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.420]   And then, "Can I teach a child to write a paper?"
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.940]   And "Can I teach a child to do geometry?"
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:11.780]   We start out because that's what we're programmed to think that school is all about.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.780]   And that homeschooling is school at home, but it's not.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.320]   Homeschooling is about growing your child into the person that God has designed them
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   to be.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.500]   It's so much more than academics.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:38.440]   So I'm so happy that you brought out how classical education impacts "real life," that it's more
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.000]   than academics.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.840]   The whole idea that you are raising a child who knows the Lord, who knows what they believe,
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.700]   and has examined it, that's what I love about our CC program and classical education.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:04.380]   It causes you to ask questions and to push back and to examine all the angles of every
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.220]   subject and every argument.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.300]   And the truth is that God is plenty big enough and strong enough to stand up to any questions
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.860]   our children will ever ask.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:21.520]   And so we need to be okay with them asking questions and pushing against, "I want my
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.920]   children, I always wanted my girls to push against the fate they had been brought up
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:34.940]   in while they were at home so that I could pray for them and I could shepherd their hearts,
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.160]   not just their brains."
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.640]   Yes, you are so right, because they have to make it their own.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.240]   And that's the only way they're going to make it their own, right?
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   Absolutely.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.240]   Yes.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.760]   And I loved it that you said that part of what classical education gave to your children
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:57.240]   was the ability to think through issues and to be confident in their beliefs and then
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.160]   be really sure in the way they conveyed their beliefs.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.720]   Yeah, and that's the rhetoric, right?
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.560]   That's what we want them to do.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:13.840]   And if I can tell us one story, Sarah, I think she was only in challenge A. I think it was
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.760]   challenge A, where they do the debates with – because it's been a while, but with the
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.760]   different issues and they take either side, you know, like abortion and –
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.280]   Yeah, we did it in big.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   We did it in big.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   Well, that's probably B, okay.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.960]   And so she had gone through that and then she and her grandmother got on the topic of
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.520]   abortion and unbeknownst to me, I think I was away at a state manager or something or
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:47.760]   other and I got a phone call from Sarah later, but her grandmother was, you know, for abortion
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.520]   in the sense that not for killing babies, she said, but just because mothers should
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.400]   have the choice and, you know, what if this happened or what if, you know.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:06.440]   And Sarah just logically went through and presented to her grandmother what it says
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.960]   in God's Word and, you know, what she had researched and her grandmother wrestled with
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.440]   it and her grandmother came back a day or two later and said that she lost sleep.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.840]   She talked to her girlfriends about it, but she changed her mind.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.120]   She said, "Sarah, you changed my mind."
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.080]   And I said to her, I said, "It wasn't Sarah who changed your mind."
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:37.840]   I said, "It was God, but God used her, but she, I mean, it was a beautiful example of,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.960]   you know, the classical model, right?"
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:46.120]   And so it was just, it was one of those moments that it just was like, wow, you know, that
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.580]   you could see in real life.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.840]   That is so powerful.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.680]   That is a really powerful testimony, Melissa, for real, because to think that a classical
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:07.240]   education can equip your children to winsomely present the truth is powerful medicine.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.240]   That's great.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.240]   And what challenges me?
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240]   They're like what, 13, 14 years old?
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.340]   Yeah, 12, 13 years old, 13 years old, yeah.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.840]   I am amazed.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   That's really awesome.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.400]   And I love what you said that the classical education taught them how to find answers,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.760]   taught them how to ask.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.720]   One thing that I absolutely love, classical education has taught my girls to ask questions,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.060]   to never be afraid to ask questions.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:39.360]   And they are constantly, they do not take statements at face value.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.120]   They had way too much logic to do that.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.560]   They will always ask a question, "Well, okay, so it's kind of like the debate thing, what
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.560]   are your sources?
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.600]   Why do you say that?"
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:59.360]   And if that's your conclusion, but your premises are not leading to that, then I'm suspicious
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.960]   and I need you to tell me more.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.380]   They are not gullible.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.160]   I guess that's what I'm saying.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:12.600]   I'm happy that a classical education has made my girls very un-gullible.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   They're very wary.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.360]   And like you said about your children, they are very confident in what they believe and
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.180]   they are confident in sharing what they believe.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.180]   And that has been beautiful.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.760]   And I know that some parents are probably thinking, "Yeah, well, some kids are just
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.280]   like that and some kids are not."
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:39.840]   I'm telling you, I had one that was born ready to debate everybody and one who would rather
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.680]   not ever and before every challenge debate ever asked if she really had to do it.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.040]   She did not enjoy it.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:57.780]   It is not her personality to be confrontational and she doesn't like to be in front of people.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:08.680]   She really is a follower at heart, but a classical education gave her the tools of leadership
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:16.140]   and the feeling of responsibility to step into a leadership gap if there is one.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:23.440]   She will absolutely step into that gap and she will absolutely talk about what she believes
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.920]   and why and make a very firm argument.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.880]   And so I feel blessed.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:36.080]   So it's not just the kids who are naturally debaters that benefit from a classical education.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.520]   It is all of our children.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   Absolutely.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:46.720]   Let me ask you, what has homeschooling taught you about your children?
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.240]   Oh, let's see.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:12:03.080]   Well, I think being with your kids day in and day out, 24/7 really, I think you learn
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.080]   a lot about them.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.080]   They learn a lot about you.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.480]   Oh my goodness, and that's the scary part.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:23.360]   But I think that ultimately, you see their personalities, but you also see where they
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.840]   can overcome things.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.880]   Like you said, what about that child that's just really introverted and shy?
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:39.560]   My one who wouldn't stand up and do a presentation because he was so shy, to work through those
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:48.880]   things with them and with God's help and encouraging them to take that step.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.640]   And so I think you really do see those things, but it's not only seeing them, it's learning
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.880]   to live with each other.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:05.240]   It's learning to overcome things that you may be struggling with.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:12.080]   I think one reason a lot of us homeschool too is to instill a biblical worldview, godly
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.120]   values in our children.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:21.260]   Being able to, on a daily basis, impart that to our kids if they're struggling, let's stop
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:29.240]   and pray about this, or just being able to be with them day in and day out.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.080]   It can be hard, but it's also a beautiful thing when you look back on it.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:43.520]   Not every day is roses and sunshine for sure, but when you look back, to me, it was just
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:56.940]   a wonderful blessing from God to be able to be with them and to see them grow and embrace
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.520]   and to impart our godly values to them.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.040]   I don't know if I've answered your question, really.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.820]   I think you answered it at the beginning when you said, "Yes, we see the good, the bad,
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.820]   and the ugly."
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.660]   And they see it about us.
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.660]   That is true.
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:23.880]   I think we get to know our children in really unique ways because we see how they respond
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.120]   to being stretched.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:33.820]   We see how they respond to doing easy things and to doing hard things.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:39.120]   We see them when they are...
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.040]   Lee used to say, "We're all just little sinners running around, and so are our children."
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.760]   So we saw their little sinner moments, and then we saw the moments where God was really
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.920]   refining them.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920]   And I think you're right.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:01.000]   It knit our hearts together in ways that would be difficult to do if we only saw each other
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.760]   a few hours a day.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:11.040]   And I do think, although I was rarely happy for my children to see the negative sides
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:20.200]   of me, we don't want our children to know that we have feet of clay.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.760]   They do grow up and realize it when they're teenagers, but when they're little...
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:30.740]   And I can remember times where I just had to go and apologize to my children.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:36.900]   I would stand outside myself and hear what I was saying and cringe, and just think, "Wow,
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:42.760]   that is absolutely not the lesson I would tell anybody to teach, and here it is what
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.320]   I have passed on."
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:55.840]   I think it is beautiful when God lets us see how a mistake that we have made and apologized
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:01.580]   for has been rectified and become a triumph.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.580]   That is beautiful.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.580]   Definitely.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.220]   I can remember when I was...
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:14.500]   I didn't do every assignment with every child every year, but one year one of my daughters
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.900]   and I were going to do chemistry, we were doing chemistry together.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.700]   And hey, I have to say that the CC chemistry is more chemistry than I ever did in high
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.320]   school and it was a really long time ago, so I was struggling.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:33.080]   I was struggling with some of that stuff and I was busy and I frankly had a bad attitude
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.160]   about chemistry and I didn't really want to be doing that.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.200]   I had other things to do.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.940]   And I can remember sitting with her and she was confused about how to do the math of some
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.540]   of the chemistry.
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:50.700]   And I can hear myself now saying to her, "You just went to class.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.400]   You learned how to do this and Ms. Carrie showed you this in class.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.600]   It was her job to teach this to you before you came home.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.180]   So did she not teach it or did you not learn it?
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.800]   What is the problem here?"
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:08.060]   And my daughter was stricken and I heard that and it's that kind of reverb over and over.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:14.380]   And I thought, "Oh my gosh, I've spent all these years telling parents that we're responsible
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.220]   for our children's education, not their tutors."
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.320]   And so I just had to say to her, I said, "Okay, honey, I'm really sorry.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.480]   I have to apologize.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.880]   I was making this.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.120]   It is not Ms. Carrie's job to be your teacher.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:32.040]   Mama is your teacher and if you are having a problem, then it's my job to help you solve
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.040]   it."
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.040]   And I said, "Here's the truth.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.400]   I don't remember how to do this and it's math and I don't remember how to do this.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.920]   So I think you need to go and ask Daddy, the math minor, 'Oh no, don't make me ask Daddy,
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.320]   please don't make me ask Daddy.'"
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.380]   And so I was like, "Okay, fine."
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.620]   With a bit of bad grace, I said, "Fine.
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:56.580]   I will get Daddy to teach me and then I will teach you."
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.980]   I said, "Because it is our job."
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.780]   I said, "Actually, Sarah, it's your job to learn, but it's my job as your homeschool
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.440]   teacher to help you learn."
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.780]   So we did it.
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.900]   Daddy taught me, I taught Sarah, we were all good.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.300]   And I thought, "Okay, that lesson's over.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.740]   I don't have to think about that again."
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:22.720]   And I didn't think about it for years until she went to college and ended up in a photography
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.200]   class that it was like the second level and she was having problems.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.520]   And I said, "Honey, why are you in this class?
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.500]   Because you didn't have the prerequisite."
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.780]   She said, "Oh, my advisor said it was fine and I started again."
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.060]   "Well, your advisor, that's her job.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:43.620]   She ought to know better than that and you just need to drop it and go take the other
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.620]   class."
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.900]   I said, "Yeah, I'll take care of it."
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.860]   So weeks went by and I had forgotten to ask her about it and I said, "Did you drop that
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:51.860]   class?"
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:52.860]   She said, "No, mama."
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.860]   I said, "Why?"
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:19:00.000]   And she said, "Well, I could tell what it was that I didn't know.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.020]   It was a bunch of grammar.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.780]   It was all the stuff that I would have gotten.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.340]   The stuff that I would have gotten in the prerequisite class was a bunch of grammar."
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.300]   And she said, "So I knew that's what I was missing.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:17.040]   So I just went online and I found it and I wrote it out and I taught it to myself and
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.540]   I'm fine now because mama, it's my job to learn."
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.540]   Good for her.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.540]   Wow.
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.360]   I was so flabbergasted.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.380]   She's telling me this on the phone and I'm just crying thinking, "Okay, so she internalized
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.940]   that last lesson, but I'm still learning it."
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:38.820]   So that's what I learned about my children is that praise the Lord, sometimes they learn
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.900]   the lessons faster than I do.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.900]   Yup.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.900]   Yup.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.940]   And that they are teachable spirits and that is just a beautiful thing.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:52.160]   So that's something that homeschooling taught me about myself that I still live in the flesh
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160]   sometimes.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.460]   What does homeschooling taught you about yourself, Melissa?
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.260]   I do too, Lisa.
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:10.780]   And it really showed me the gaps in my education because I see, even to this day, I still struggle
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:22.060]   with asking questions and being confident and because I didn't grow up that way.
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.380]   It was basically input and output.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.700]   Your teacher got you something, you memorized it, you spit it out on a test and got straight
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:35.040]   A's and then you totally forgot it and you didn't process anything.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.040]   You didn't make it your own.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.300]   You didn't go through that dialectic stage at all, really.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:49.020]   And so, I really saw the gaps in my education and to see where my children are much better
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:58.460]   equipped and not only with education, not only educationally, but in all aspects of
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:08.860]   life because I love that they make things their own and that they ask questions and
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:16.120]   they don't just take what someone else says at face value and those kinds of things.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.100]   So I really did see the gaps in my education, for sure.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:28.660]   And obviously, too, I am a center saved by grace.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:36.740]   All those things that you mentioned really set our kids up to learn for a lifetime that
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:44.780]   the habit of asking probing questions and examining something from a bunch of different
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:53.740]   directions that the encouragement to push back against ideas and not just accept them,
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:58.220]   the whole encouragement to chase their curiosity.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.460]   I think that's what homeschooling and classical education does.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:08.140]   It gives you permission to chase your passion and to pursue that curiosity.
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:14.140]   And that does set us up well to learn for a lifetime because we feel like we can chase
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:20.140]   our curiosity and know how to research and find an answer.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.700]   I think that's kind of fun.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.380]   I mean, I'm sure you are, too.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:29.580]   I'm just thankful that I was able to reclaim some of my own education because I was teaching
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:34.900]   my children.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:42.060]   I think that has been a big blessing for me and for David, that we have reclaimed a lot
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:48.900]   of what we were never taught and then reclaimed a lot of what we forgot because we had nothing
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.140]   to hang it on.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:56.900]   We didn't have a file folder to put that in, and so it didn't get saved.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.900]   One of the things that I've loved about reclaiming my education is seeing the connections between
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:02.900]   things.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:09.980]   There was nobody who really tried to tie it all together, especially in high school.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:15.180]   You have a different teacher for every subject and they act like they're the only teacher
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.500]   and their subject doesn't touch any other one.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:25.660]   So that has been a great reclamation for us, I think.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:32.620]   What habits, so think about habits that you and your kids and your husband, too, what
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:38.860]   did y'all practice or what habits did you develop as you homeschooled?
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:47.700]   I would say some of the habits would be reading together.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:56.220]   All my children love to read, but the practice of reading together and reading God's Word
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:04.100]   together, which I love, and what other habits would there be?
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:15.200]   Research, going to the library and doing research together was something, too, that I remember
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.560]   doing on a regular basis and you're having me pull way back in my brain.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.560]   I know.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.560]   I know.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.980]   I just think it's so valuable.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:31.100]   We talk a lot about, you know, we've started talking in CC about the five core habits.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:37.660]   There were a lot of habits that we've all practiced with our kids and in our families
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.260]   for years that go beyond the five core habits.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.400]   So I just wondered, you know, what habits you have.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:51.380]   Maybe just spending time together, you know, whether it's sitting around the breakfast
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.880]   table reading God's Word and praying for the day, or if it's going on a nature walk, you
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:06.260]   know, or whatever it is, you know, it's spending that time together.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.620]   And the kids spending time together, too, when they're little, you know, like you were
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.880]   saying when we were talking about, you know, the benefits, what do we see, the benefits
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:22.860]   of having all of our kids at home and homeschooling them, you know, not only do they, we as parents
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.280]   get to spend time, they spend time with each other and they see, they learn to interact
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.700]   with each other because, you know, you always tell them, "Oh, well, you can pick your friends
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.340]   but God gave you your family."
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:42.060]   And so you need to learn to love and forgive and live with and, you know, your family because
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:45.220]   they're going to always be there, you know, because sometimes you might have a friend
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.980]   that you have a falling out with and you never see them again or talk to them again kind
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:54.260]   of thing, which isn't a good thing, I'm not saying that, but your family, you know, you're
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.800]   living with them and you've got to learn to work through those things.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.940]   It's that sanctification process, right?
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.540]   I love that conflict resolution.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.540]   That's right.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:11.300]   It's a great habit to practice, and you're right, it's sometimes the first, the family
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:17.460]   is where we either learn to do that well or learn to avoid it.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:22.900]   And so, yeah, absolutely, that's a great habit to pursue.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:29.460]   When we, I'm thinking about both when the girls were little and as they grew, we tried
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:37.900]   to develop the habit of serving, and when they're really little, I mean, we tried to
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:43.220]   encourage them to serve one another or to serve somebody in our family or to serve our
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.220]   family.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:50.420]   So like, yeah, I mean, you're not going to get an allowance for setting the table because
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.700]   you are serving our family.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:57.380]   You're serving the family like mama serves the family by cooking dinner and daddy serves
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.180]   the family by bringing wood in for the fireplace.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.200]   You are serving the family when you set the table.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.460]   And so then we practice serving other people, you know, like doing something for a shut-in
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.980]   neighbor or visiting the nursing home with our church group or something.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:13.980]   So serving...
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:19.180]   That's a great one, yes, we are big on that, too.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.780]   Yeah, we played outside a lot.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.300]   The girls played outside a lot.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:29.940]   We did not do, and admittedly, my kids grew up when screens were not much of a thing.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:36.220]   But a lot of them, there were handheld games then and there was TV, but we did not, we
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.340]   didn't do screens.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.500]   They played outside.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:43.140]   School day was over that I would turn that and I discovered later that what they mostly
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:48.060]   played outside was whatever we had been reading or studying about.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:55.860]   They made pirate ships and they made castles and prairie houses and brick ovens out of
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.740]   bricks and a aluminum foil and all kinds of stuff.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.720]   So we played outside a lot.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.800]   That was a habit.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.460]   We did like you, we read a lot together.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:14.300]   We had the habit of praying together every night and every morning as a family and said
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.300]   that was good.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:21.640]   And even teaching them things around the house, like whether it's to cook or to do laundry
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:27.760]   or those kinds of things that are important life skills.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.860]   And I think as homeschoolers, we probably did it at an earlier age than a lot of people
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.860]   do.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:34.860]   Well, because they were home.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:35.860]   That's right.
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.580]   They were home when we were doing the chores.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.580]   That's right.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:44.300]   And it prepares them for life once you get out of the house.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.420]   Your wife will be glad that you know how to do this.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:53.220]   I can remember one of my daughters going to school and she was just absolutely shocked.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.300]   Her roommate did not know how to do it.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.300]   There were a lot of things.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.780]   She didn't know how to sweep effectively.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.980]   She did not know how to iron.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.580]   And so my daughter was like, "What in the world?"
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.580]   And I think my husband got a real charge out of it because he used to preach these things
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.620]   as life skills, "I'm teaching you life skills.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.860]   These are good life skills.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.900]   Just how do you know how to live your life?"
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:23.420]   And so she got to college and passed on a few of those life skills to her friends.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.380]   That's great.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.900]   Yes.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.900]   They're all good habits.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:36.460]   I think I just want all of our listeners to hear there are habits that belong in your
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:44.680]   home school that you might not think of as academic, but they are habits that you practice.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.260]   Maybe it's simple habits like taking turns.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.200]   You know, is it your turn to pick the family movie?
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.780]   Is it your turn to pick the kind of ice cream?
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.700]   Is it your turn to pick the cereal?
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.060]   I mean, it's taking turns.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:05.220]   It's a habit of showing mercy to people who've made a mistake.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:14.120]   Like we trained our girls to not only give apologies, but to accept apologies.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.380]   You train their character.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.740]   There's all kinds of habits.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:23.700]   So for you, what has been the most challenging part of homeschooling?
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:31.940]   I think that it's always challenging when, you know, one thing that I was really challenging
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:42.620]   with, especially one of my children, was when they don't get what you're trying to teach.
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:49.260]   And none of us, I remember saying, none of us know everything, and we all have to learn.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:57.060]   So it's okay if you don't understand it at first, but working with that child and not
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:05.340]   getting frustrated myself, because I did that many times, and helping them to see because,
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:10.060]   you know, when they're struggling through something and you're a little frustrated because
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:16.980]   they're kind of taking it out on you, and so it's, you know, I think it's those kinds
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.980]   of things.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:27.740]   It's more of the, not so much the academics, but the character traits that, you know, those
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:32.860]   life things and those personality things, you know, working through those things, I
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.420]   think were harder than, you know, academics.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.540]   Yes, it was hard to, like you said, with chemistry, you know, it was hard to teach things that
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:46.540]   you don't remember, or maybe you weren't really good at it when you were in high school, because
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.260]   I remember people telling me that all the time, like, "How can you teach everything?
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:57.260]   How can you teach physics and chemistry and, you know, all those things that, how do you
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.900]   know all of that?"
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.900]   And I'm like, "I don't."
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.680]   I have to learn a lot with these children.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   But I can learn alongside.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.680]   Yes.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.680]   I'm going to learn alongside of them.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.680]   That's right.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:13.860]   And so, but I think harder than all of that was, you know, more of the personality and
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:21.500]   character things, because you are with your children all the time, and we're all human.
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:25.740]   And that's just, some days it was hard, you know?
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.740]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:32.380]   But if you think about it, those are the eternal things.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:38.940]   I mean, it, I'm not saying it's not good to know how to do a proof, you know, a logic
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.460]   proof or geometry, that is a fine thing.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:49.580]   I am saying that's not an eternal significance thing.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:57.740]   And the Lord has given us our children and trusted us to guide them to the eternal things.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.560]   And sometimes, I completely agree with you that that is the most challenging part of
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.560]   homeschooling.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:06.620]   So parents who are listening to this thinking, "Oh, I don't know how I'm going to do high
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.620]   school math."
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.620]   That is the least of your worries.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.620]   That is so true.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.880]   That is going to be the least of your worries.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:18.820]   And then you need to remember too, like when they, you know, they graduate and they become
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:24.780]   young adults themselves, you have poured into them, you have prayed for them, you have instilled,
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:29.740]   you know, the biblical worldview, the godly values, but then you have to entrust them
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.840]   to God and they then have to make their own decisions.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:39.540]   And it may not always be, you know, what you would want it to be.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:45.900]   And that's hard, you know, that's hard, but just you have to, you know, God is teaching
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:53.980]   me to remember He is faithful and, you know, my husband and I, you know, to the best of
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:34:00.140]   our ability, you know, or raise them the way we felt God wanted us to, but then they have
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:04.180]   to make their own, you know, choices when they get to be older.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:09.860]   And so, so yeah, so that's, you have to remember that too.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.860]   Absolutely.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:20.140]   In hindsight, what have you discovered to be the most necessary trait for a homeschooling
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.140]   parent?
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:26.740]   I would say if I had to just pick one, I would say humility, probably.
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:36.340]   And just remembering, you know, that I am nothing and, you know, I'm a sinner and I
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.460]   am nothing.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.260]   And one of my favorite verses is, "He must increase and I must decrease."
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:48.780]   And just remembering that because it is not easy, you know, nothing about raising kids
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:54.860]   is easy anyway, but homeschooling is not easy, but it's so rewarding.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:35:00.440]   But, you know, it really, you have to rely on God.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:09.460]   And so I think just, you know, humility and remembering who He is and who I am, so.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.620]   That you know what, I don't think if you had thought for a week, you couldn't have come
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.620]   up with a better answer.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.620]   I think that's very true.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.900]   And we can't take pride in our children either, right?
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:24.260]   I mean, that's, you can't, I mean, it's just, you know, I also love that verse, "I have
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:28.060]   no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth," which is so true.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.060]   We don't.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.900]   We have no greater joy, but it's not because of us, you know?
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:38.980]   We spend most of our time trying to get out of God's way for Him to do what He wants to
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:45.100]   do in the lives of our children, who He loves more than we ever could, if we can even imagine
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.100]   that.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:51.900]   Okay, what would you tell a beginning homeschooler to do first?
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:57.600]   So there's somebody who's just considering this homeschooling journey, and they look
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.460]   all the way down to the end, and they think, "Oh gosh, I can't look that far.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.780]   I'm just going to look right here in front of me."
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.340]   What's the first thing they should do?
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:10.060]   I would say just, what does your child need, you know?
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:14.060]   I mean, what does your child need?
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.820]   And it's not always just academics.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.140]   I mean, yes, we have to get through the academics.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:23.300]   I mean, I think we've made it clear that we're not saying you don't, but what does
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.580]   your child need?
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.440]   And then you can go from there.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:39.260]   And so that would probably be the first thing I would say, and then just asking God to help
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.260]   you.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.260]   Yes.
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.260]   Yeah.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:47.780]   See, this is why you are the experienced homeschool mom, because I can feel it.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:53.400]   I can feel all the listeners who are just homeschooled, just thinking about homeschool,
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.700]   the beginning parents thinking, "Well, I guess I would test their reading level or I would
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.700]   see what they're able to do."
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:05.140]   We're all thinking things like that, but so you know what is necessary.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.820]   Who is my child?
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.060]   What are they like?
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:20.780]   How has God shaped them and what do they need to become the most them that God made them
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.780]   to be?
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.780]   That's right.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.060]   And then you don't have to be perfect.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.460]   I mean, you can try something with them.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.460]   If it doesn't work, hey, change it.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.460]   Try a different thing.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.660]   I had one child that I must have tried.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.420]   I felt like I tried every spelling curriculum out there, and he just was not getting it.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.820]   And I talked to everybody, "What do you use?
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.820]   What do you use?"
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:43.820]   And he was frustrated.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.820]   I was frustrated.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:45.820]   I'm like, "Oh."
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.140]   But we just kept on.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.820]   And I finally, the Lord finally helped me find, I mean, we hit on something that worked
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:38:01.300]   for him, and it was what he needed and it wasn't what, yeah, it's good to talk to other
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.780]   people and find out what they're doing and all that stuff, but remember, it may not be
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:12.900]   for your child, and it's okay to change, to change midship and just go a different way
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.860]   if they need to.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:15.860]   Absolutely.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:16.860]   Absolutely.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.140]   This has been the best thing to catch up with you.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.140]   Oh, you too.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:28.460]   And it's the best thing to pluck your wisdom from the years.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.460]   Last question.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:35.020]   If you had it to do over again, would you do it?
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.540]   Would you homeschool your kids?
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:46.900]   It was worth every tear, every late night, every joy, every, it was definitely, oh yes.
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:54.580]   I think beyond anything else, listeners, that's what we want you to know that every hard knock,
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:39:02.220]   every bruise, every struggle is worth it.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:10.100]   Finding your hearts together as a family, developing a rhythm of learning as a family,
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:19.260]   a family culture that hangs together, that celebrates one another is worth devoting your
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.660]   life to.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:25.860]   So go and invest in your children, go and invest in your family.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.740]   It will pay dividends for life, and you'll never be sorry.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.100]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
