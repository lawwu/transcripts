[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   The first deep life question comes from Kim.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.360]   Kim says, does your focus on the quantity of books
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.160]   that you read dilute their impact?
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.800]   Can you remember the content of that many books
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.760]   or does it even matter?
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.960]   Kim, I don't think I read that many books.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.800]   I read five books a month.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.200]   I don't think that's that many.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.560]   I think in June, I'm gonna read six
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.560]   because I had a couple of days where I was being COVID-y.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.400]   So I took advantage of that to read an extra book.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.480]   I don't think that's a lot of books.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.640]   I think our standards are too low.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.760]   I think our standards for intellectual engagement
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.080]   have got so low that that seems like
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.480]   some impossibly large amount.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.880]   But I think historically speaking,
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.200]   or looking at the life of any sort of serious intellectual,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.360]   especially pre-internet intellectual,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.000]   five books a month is nothing.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.840]   That's nothing.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.080]   And so no, I don't think I read too much
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.240]   to dilute their impact.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.520]   Again, here's the thing.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.260]   I don't skim.
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.040]   I'm not staying up late in the night
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.840]   to try to make some numbers.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.680]   You have more time than you think
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.040]   to do things like reading
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.480]   if you get rid of other things that are taking its place,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240]   namely looking at your phone.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.760]   Just leisurely reading in your spare time
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.520]   can generate more books completed than you would imagine.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.920]   So I actually uploaded a video a couple of weeks ago.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.200]   I recorded it just for YouTube.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.440]   It was just an inspiration I had.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.480]   So you can only find it at the
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.920]   youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280]   But it was called something like
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.040]   how I read five books a month.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.840]   And so Kim, you might want to watch that.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.440]   I get into what I do in my life
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.360]   to get through that many books.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.160]   If you watch that video, you'll see
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.080]   not that much reading.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.240]   (upbeat music)
