[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   "The following is a conversation with Avi Loeb,
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.120]   "an astrophysicist, astronomer, and cosmologist at Harvard.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.700]   "He has authored over 800 papers and written eight books,
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.880]   "including his latest called 'Extraterrestrial,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.920]   "The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth.'
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.820]   "It'll be released in a couple of weeks,
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.200]   "so go pre-order it now to show support
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.520]   "for what I think is truly an important book
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.460]   "in that it serves as a strong example of a scientist
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.040]   "being both rigorous and open-minded
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.760]   "about the question of intelligent alien civilizations
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.200]   "in our universe."
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.900]   Quick mention of our sponsors,

[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.480]   that has very little to do with fasting.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.820]   Choose wisely, my friends.

[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.020]   As a side note, let me say a bit more
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.820]   about why Avi's work is so exciting to me
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.580]   and I think to a lot of people.
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.460]   In 2017, a strange interstellar object,
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.200]   now named a muamua, it's fun to say,
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.780]   was detected traveling through our solar system.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.140]   Based on the evidence we have,
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.540]   it has strange characteristics
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.240]   which made it not like any asteroid or comet
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.820]   that we've seen before.
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.580]   Avi was one of the only world-class scientists
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.660]   who fearlessly suggested that we should be open-minded
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.340]   about whether it is naturally made
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.400]   or in fact is an artifact
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.940]   of an intelligent alien civilization.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.080]   In fact, he suggested that the more likely explanation,
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.120]   given the evidence, is the latter hypothesis.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.700]   We also talk about a lot of fascinating mysteries
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.100]   in our universe, including black holes,
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.180]   dark matter, the Big Bang,
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.900]   and close to speed of light space travel.
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.220]   The theme throughout is that in scientific pursuits,
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.740]   the weird things, the anomalies,
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.180]   the ideas that right now are considered taboo
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.940]   should not be ignored if we're to have a chance
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.060]   at finding the next big breakthrough,
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.300]   the next big paradigm shift,
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.340]   and also if we are to inspire the world
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.300]   with the power and beauty of science.

[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.480]   And now, here's my conversation with Avi Loeb.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.500]   In the introduction to your new book, "Extraterrestrial,"
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.460]   you write, "This book confronts
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.020]   "one of the universe's most profound questions,
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.180]   "are we alone?
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.500]   "Over time, this question has been framed in different ways.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.520]   "Is life here on Earth the only life in the universe?
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.020]   "Are humans the only sentient intelligence
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.520]   "in the vastness of space and time?"
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.220]   A better, more precise framing of this question
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.780]   would be this, "Throughout the expanse of space
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.740]   "and over the lifetime of the universe,
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.200]   "are there now or have ever been
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.980]   "other sentient civilizations that, like ours,
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.580]   "explored the stars and left evidence of their efforts?"
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.420]   So let me ask, are we alone?
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.020]   - That's an excellent question.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.440]   For me, the answer is sort of clear
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.520]   because I start from the principle of modesty.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.320]   (Sherlock laughs)
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.960]   If we believe that we are alone and special and unique,
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.680]   that shows arrogance.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.360]   My daughters, when they were infants,
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.260]   they tended to think that they are special, unique,
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.560]   and then they went out to the street
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.800]   and realized that other kids are very much like them,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.480]   and then they developed a sense of a better perspective
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.100]   about themselves.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.920]   And I think the only reason that we are still thinking
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.960]   that we are special is because we haven't searched
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.920]   well enough to find others
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.700]   that might even be better than us.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.360]   And I say that because I look at the newspaper every morning
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.600]   and I see that we do foolish things.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.000]   We are not necessarily the most intelligent ones.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.920]   And if you think about it, if you open a recipe book,
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.720]   you see that out of the same ingredients,
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.040]   you can make very different cakes,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.280]   depending on how you put them together
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.980]   and how you heat them up.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.400]   And what is the chance that by taking the soup of chemicals
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.440]   that existed on Earth and cooking it one way
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.960]   to get our life, that you got the best cake possible?
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.680]   I mean, we are probably not the sharpest cookie in the jar.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.020]   And my question is, I mean, it's pretty obvious to me
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.320]   that we are probably not alone
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.320]   because half of all the sun-like stars,
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.800]   we know now as astronomers,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.760]   half of the sun-like stars from the Kepler satellite data
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.400]   have a planet the size of the Earth,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.160]   roughly at the same distance that the Earth is from the sun.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.060]   And that means that they can have liquid water
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.160]   on their surface and the chemistry of life as we know it.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.260]   So if you roll the dice billions of times
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.960]   just within the Milky Way galaxy,
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.160]   and then you have tens of billions of galaxies like it
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.280]   within the observable volume of the universe,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.720]   it would be extremely arrogant
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.680]   to think that we are special.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.520]   I would think that we are sort of middle of the road,
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.400]   typical forms of life.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.160]   And that's why nobody pays attention to us.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.680]   If you go down the street on a sidewalk
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.520]   and you see an ant, you don't pay attention
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.520]   or a special respect to that ant,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.680]   you just continue to walk.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.960]   And so I think that we are sort of average,
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.800]   not very interesting, not exciting,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.760]   so nobody cares about us.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.560]   We tend to think that we are special,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.480]   but that's a sign of immaturity.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.480]   - And we're very early on in our development.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.680]   - Yes, that's another thing,
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.800]   that we have our technology only for 100 years
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.520]   and it's evolving exponentially right now
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.200]   on a three-year timescale.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.600]   So imagine what would happen in 100 years,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.880]   in 1,000 years, in a million years or in a billion years.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.800]   Now the sun is actually relatively late
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.160]   in the star formation history of the universe.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.880]   Most of the sun-like stars formed earlier
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.120]   and some of them already died, became white dwarfs.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.120]   So if you imagine that a civilization like ours
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.120]   existed around a typical sun-like star,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.040]   by now, if they survived,
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.480]   they could be a billion years old.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.360]   And then imagine a billion-year technology.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.840]   It would look like magic to us,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.520]   an approximation to God.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.800]   We wouldn't be able to understand it.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.480]   And so in my view, we should be humble.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.880]   And by the way, we should probably just listen
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.680]   and not speak because there is a risk, right?
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.080]   If you are inferior, there is a risk.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.600]   If you speak too loudly,
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.760]   something bad may happen to you.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.440]   - You mentioned we should be humble also in the sense
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.160]   with the analogy to ants,
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.000]   that they might be better than us.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.960]   So there's a kind of scale that we're talking about.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.080]   And in the question, you mentioned the word sentient.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.600]   So sentience, or maybe the more basic formulation of that
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.000]   is consciousness.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Do you think that this thing within us humans
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.440]   in terms of the typical life form of consciousness
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.240]   is the essential element that permeates
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.360]   if there's other alien civilizations out there
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.120]   that they have something like consciousness as well?
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.360]   Or is this, I guess I'm asking,
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.400]   can you try to untangle the word sentient?
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.280]   - Yeah, so that's a good question.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.040]   I think what is most abundant,
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.200]   depending on how long it survives.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.800]   So if you look at us as an example,
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.280]   we are now, we do have conscious and we do have technology,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.040]   but the technologies that we are developing
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.040]   are also means for our own destruction, as we can tell.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.800]   We can change the climate if we are not careful enough.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.120]   We can go into nuclear wars.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.280]   So we are developing means for our own destruction
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.280]   through self-inflicted wounds.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.840]   And it might well be that creatures like us
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   are not long-lived, that the crocodiles on other planets
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.400]   live for billions of years.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.960]   They don't destroy themselves, they live naturally.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.560]   And so if you look around, the most common thing
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.920]   would be dumb animals that live for long times,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.000]   not those that have conscious.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.440]   But in terms of changing the environment,
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.400]   I think since, I mean, humans develop tools,
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   they develop the ability to construct technologies
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.280]   that would lift us from this planet that we were born in.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.120]   And that's something animals without a consciousness
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.600]   cannot really do.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   And so I, in terms of looking for things
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.120]   that went beyond the circumstances they were born into,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.640]   I would think that even if they're short-lived,
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.580]   these are the creatures that made the biggest difference
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.600]   to their environment, and we can search for them.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.080]   Even if they're short-lived,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.280]   and most of the civilizations are dead by now.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.120]   Even if that's the case--
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.920]   - That's sad to think about, by the way.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.680]   - Well, but if you look on Earth,
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.880]   that there are lots of cultures that existed throughout time
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.120]   and they're dead by now.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.820]   The Mayan culture was very sophisticated, died,
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.420]   but we can find evidence for it and learn about it
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.780]   just by archeology, digging into the ground, looking.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.060]   And so we can do the same thing in space.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.100]   Look for dead civilizations,
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.440]   and perhaps we can learn a lesson why they died
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.340]   and behave better so that we will not share the same fate.
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.500]   So I think there is a lesson to be learned from the sky.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.160]   And by the way, I should also say,
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.060]   if we find a technology that we have not dreamed of,
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.500]   that we can import to Earth,
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.900]   that may be a better strategy for making a fortune
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.820]   than going to Silicon Valley or going to Wall Street.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:07.660]   (Lex laughs)
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.180]   Because you make a jump start into something of the future.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.460]   - So that's one way to do the leap is actually to find,
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.860]   to literally discover versus come up with the idea
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.420]   in our own limited human capacity,
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.300]   like a cognitive capacity.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.060]   - It would feel like cheating in an exam
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.100]   where you look over the shoulder of a student next to you.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.140]   But it's not good on an exam,
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.600]   but it is good when you're coming up with technology
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.580]   that could change the fabric of human civilization.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.660]   But there is, in my neck of the woods
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.340]   of artificial intelligence,
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.940]   there's a lot of trajectories one can imagine
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.940]   of creating very powerful beings,
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.540]   the technology that's essentially,
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.420]   you can call superintelligence,
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.060]   that could achieve space exploration,
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.780]   all those kinds of things without consciousness,
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.220]   without something that to us humans
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.620]   looks like consciousness.
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.620]   And there is a sad feeling I have that consciousness too,
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.580]   in terms of us being humble,
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.620]   is a thing we humans take too seriously,
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.640]   that we think it's special just because we have it.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.580]   But it could be a thing that's actually holding us back
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.420]   in some kind of way.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.260]   - May well be, may well be.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.220]   I should say something about AI
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.300]   because I do think it offers a very important
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.880]   step into the future.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.360]   If you look at the Old Testament, the Bible,
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.060]   there is this story about Noah's Ark
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.940]   that you might know about.
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.240]   Noah knew about a great flood
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.860]   that is about to endanger all life on earth.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.760]   So he decided to build an ark.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.540]   And the Bible actually talks about specifically
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.700]   what the size of this ark was,
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.180]   what the dimensions were.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.460]   Turns out it was quite similar to Umuamua
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.380]   that we will discuss in a few minutes.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.020]   But at any event, he built this ark
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.220]   and he put animals on it
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.060]   so that they were saved from the great flood.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.820]   Now you can think about doing the same on earth
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.620]   because there are risks for future catastrophes.
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.600]   We could have the self-inflicted wounds
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.900]   that we were talking about,
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.140]   like nuclear war, changing the climate,
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.620]   or there could be an asteroid impacting us,
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.940]   just like the dinosaurs died.
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.100]   The dinosaurs didn't have science, astronomy,
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.600]   they couldn't have a warning system,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.380]   but there was this big stone, big rock that approached them.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.560]   It must've been a beautiful sight.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.780]   Just when it was approaching,
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.220]   got very big and then smashed them, okay, and killed them.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.740]   So you could have a catastrophe like that,
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.940]   or in a billion years,
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.860]   the sun will basically boil off all the oceans on earth.
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.420]   And currently all our eggs are in one basket,
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.220]   but we can spread them.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.340]   It's sort of like the printing press,
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.420]   if you think about it.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.940]   The revolution that Gutenberg brought
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.460]   is there were very few copies of the Bible at the time,
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.140]   and each of them was precious because it was handwritten.
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.180]   But once the printing press produced multiple copies,
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.500]   if something bad happened to one of the copies,
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.340]   it wasn't a catastrophe, it wasn't disaster
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.180]   'cause you had many more copies.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.180]   And so if we have copies of life here on earth elsewhere,
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.220]   then we avoid the risk of it being eliminated
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.000]   by a single point breakdown, catastrophe.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.380]   So the question is, can we build NOAAX spaceship
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.460]   that will carry life as we know it?
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.060]   Now, you might think we have to put elephants
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.660]   and whales and birds on a big spaceship,
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.060]   but that's not true because all you need to know
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.780]   is the DNA making, the genetic making of these animals,
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.780]   put it on a computer system that has AI plus a 3D printer
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:03.820]   so that this CubeSat, which is rather small,
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.860]   can go with this information to another planet
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.160]   and use the raw materials there to produce synthetic life.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.800]   And that would be a way of producing copies,
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.500]   just like the Gutenberg printing press.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.580]   - Yeah, and it doesn't have to be exact copies
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.460]   of the humans, it could just contain
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.740]   some basic elements of life and then have enough life
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.740]   on board that it could reproduce the process of evolution
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.380]   on another place.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.380]   So I mean, that also makes you sad, of course,
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.580]   because you confront the mortality
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.460]   of your own little precious consciousness
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.900]   and all your own memories and knowledge
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:39.740]   and all that stuff. - That's right,
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.380]   but who cares?
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.220]   I mean, we are not--
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.460]   - I care about mine, right, and you care about yours.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.060]   - No, no, I actually don't.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.340]   You know, if you look at the big,
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.380]   if you're an astronomer, one thing that you learn
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.220]   from the universe is to be modest,
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.100]   'cause you're not so significant.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.980]   - Oh, boy, yeah. - I mean, think about it.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.900]   All these emperors and kings that conquered a piece of land
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.860]   on Earth and were extremely proud.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.860]   You know, you see these images of kings and emperors
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.860]   that usually are alpha males, and they stand strong,
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.980]   and they're very proud of themselves.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.380]   But if you think about it, there are 10 to the power 20
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.880]   planets like the Earth in the observable volume
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.580]   of the universe, and this view of conquering a piece
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.900]   of land and even conquering all of Earth
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.940]   is just like an ant hugging a single grain of sand
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.860]   on the landscape of a huge beach.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.400]   That's not very impressive.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.500]   So you can't be arrogant.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.500]   If you see the big picture, you have to be humble.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.380]   You know, also, we are short-lived.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.180]   You know, within 100 years, that's it, right?
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.060]   So what does it teach you?
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.100]   First, to be humble, modest.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.660]   You never have significant powers relative
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.420]   to the big scheme of things.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.660]   And second, you should appreciate every day that you live.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.880]   - Yes. - And learn about the world.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.780]   - Humble and still grateful.
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.500]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:06.500]   - Well, let's talk about probably the most interesting
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.460]   object I've heard about and also the most fun to pronounce.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.380]   - Oumuamua, yes. - Oumuamua.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.500]   Can you tell me the story of this object
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.060]   and why it may be an important event in human history?
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.040]   And is it possibly a piece of alien technology?
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.260]   - Right, so this is the first object
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.140]   that was spotted close to Earth
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.780]   from outside the solar system.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.780]   And it was found on October 19th, 2017.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.920]   And at that time, it was receding away from us.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.320]   And at first, astronomers thought it must be a piece
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.560]   of rock, just like all the asteroids and comets
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.420]   that we have seen from within the solar system.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.900]   And it just came from another star.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.460]   I should say that the actual discovery of this object
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.260]   was surprising to me because a decade earlier,
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.780]   I wrote the first paper together with Ed Turner
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.740]   and Amaya Moro-Martin that tried to predict
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.060]   whether the same telescope that was surveying the sky,
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.140]   Pan-STARRS, from Hawaii, would find anything
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.100]   from interstellar space, given what we know
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.000]   about the solar system.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.600]   So if you assume that other planetary systems
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.420]   have similar abundance of rocks and you just calculate
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.760]   how many should be ejected into interstellar space,
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.700]   the conclusion is no, we shouldn't find anything
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.960]   with Pan-STARRS.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.700]   - To me, I apologize, probably revealing my stupidity,
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.800]   but it was surprising to me that so few interstellar objects
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.160]   from outside this whole system have ever been detected.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.000]   - No, none. - None.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.560]   - Nothing. - None has been.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.120]   - You do, well, maybe talk about it,
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.760]   that there has been one or two rocks since then.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.120]   - Well, since then, there was one called the Borisov.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.000]   It was discovered by an amateur Russian astronomer,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Gennady Borisov, and that one looked like a comet.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.480]   And just like a comet from within the solar system.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.880]   - But this is a really important point,
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.600]   and sorry to interrupt it.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.800]   You showed that it's unlikely that a rock
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.480]   from another solar system would arrive to ours.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.900]   - Right, and so the actual detection of this one
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.000]   was surprising by itself, to me.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.840]   - Yes, yes.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.560]   - But then, so at first they thought maybe it's a comet
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.600]   or an asteroid, but then it didn't look like anything
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.120]   we've seen before.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.440]   Borisov did look like a comet, so people asked me afterwards
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.840]   and said, you know, doesn't it convince you
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.400]   if Borisov looks like a comet, doesn't it convince you
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.040]   that Oumuamua is also natural?
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.840]   And I said, you know, when I went on the first date
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.280]   with my wife, she looked special to me,
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.280]   and since then I met many women,
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.400]   that didn't change my opinion of my wife.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.360]   So, you know, that's not an argument.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.360]   Anyway, so why did Oumuamua look weird?
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.520]   Let me explain.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.280]   So first of all, astronomers monitored the amount of light,
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.360]   sunlight, that it reflects.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.840]   And it was tumbling, spinning, every eight hours.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.040]   And as it was spinning, the brightness that we saw
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.800]   from that direction, we couldn't resolve it
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.160]   'cause it's tiny, it's about 100 meters, a few hundred feet,
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.280]   size of a football field, and we cannot, from Earth,
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.160]   with existing telescopes, we cannot resolve it.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.760]   The only way to actually get a photograph of it
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.860]   is to send a camera close to it,
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.000]   and that was not possible at the time
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.120]   that Oumuamua was discovered
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.240]   because it was already moving away from us
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.480]   faster than any rocket we can send.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.800]   It's sort of like a guest that appeared for dinner,
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.840]   and then by the time we realized that it's weird,
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.600]   the guest is already out the front door
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.520]   into the dark street.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.040]   What we would like to find is an object like it
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.440]   approaching us, because then you can send the camera,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.680]   irrespective of how fast it moves.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.000]   And if we were to find it in July 2017,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.360]   that would have been possible
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.560]   because it was approaching us at that time.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.120]   Actually, I was visiting Mount Haleakala in Maui, Hawaii,
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.760]   with my family for vacation at that time, in July 2017,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.200]   but nobody knew at the observatory
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.520]   that Oumuamua is very close.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.480]   - That's sad to think about,
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.880]   that we had the opportunity at that time
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.960]   to send up a camera.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.160]   - But don't worry, I mean, there will be more.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.480]   There will be more because, you know,
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.360]   I operate by the Copernican principle,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.400]   which says we don't live at a special place,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.920]   and we don't live at a special time.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.360]   And that means, you know,
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.400]   if we surveyed the sky for a few years,
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.680]   and we had sensitivity to this region
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.320]   between us and the sun,
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.720]   and we found this object with pan-stars,
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.080]   you know, there should be many more
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.240]   that we will find in the future
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.280]   with surveys that might be even better.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.520]   And actually, in three years' timescale,
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.400]   there would be the so-called LSST,
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.240]   that's a survey of the Vera Rubin Observatory,
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.280]   that would be much more sensitive
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.560]   and could potentially find an Oumuamua-like object
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.840]   every month, okay? - Yes, wow.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.840]   - So I'm just waiting for that.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.480]   And the main reason for me to alert everyone
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.720]   to the unusual properties of Oumuamua
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.360]   is with the hope that next time around,
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.480]   when we see something as unusual,
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.760]   we would take a photograph,
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.800]   or we would get as much evidence as possible,
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.080]   'cause science is based on evidence, not on prejudice.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.080]   And we will get back to that theme.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.920]   So anyway, let me point out what is--
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.000]   - Some of the properties, actually.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.760]   - Yes. - Yeah, the elongated nature,
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.880]   all those kinds of things. - Right.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.840]   So the light curve, the amount of light,
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.320]   sunlight that was reflected from it,
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.480]   was changing over eight hours by a factor of 10,
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.440]   meaning that the area of this object,
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.440]   even though we can't resolve it,
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.400]   the area on the sky that reflects sunlight
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.120]   was bigger by a factor of 10 in some phases
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.400]   as it was tumbling around than in other phases.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.760]   So even if you take a piece of paper that is razor thin,
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.720]   there is a very small likelihood that it's exactly edge-on.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.360]   And getting a factor of 10 change in the area
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.520]   that you see on the sky is huge.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.920]   It's much more than any other.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.760]   It means that the object has an unusual geometry.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.640]   It's at least a factor of a few more
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.560]   than any of the comets or asteroids
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.760]   that we have seen before.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.320]   - You mentioned reflectivity,
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.700]   so it's not just the geometry,
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.440]   but the properties of the surface of that thing.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.000]   - Well-- - Or no.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.760]   - If you assume the reflectivity is the same,
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.080]   then it's just geometry.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.720]   If you assume the reflectivity may change,
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.960]   then it could be a combination of the area that you see
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.840]   and the reflectivity,
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.040]   because different directions may reflect differently.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.400]   But the point is that it's very extreme.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.280]   - Yes.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.720]   - And actually the best fit to the light curve that we saw
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.360]   was of a flat object,
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.880]   unlike all the cartoons that you have seen of a cigar shape.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.920]   A flat object at the 90% confidence
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.800]   gives a better model for the way that the light varied.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.520]   And it's also-- - So like flat,
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.480]   meaning like a pancake.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.960]   - Like a pancake, exactly. - Yeah, got it.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.120]   - And so that's the very first unusual property.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.240]   But to me, it was not unusual enough
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.640]   to think that it might be artificial.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   It was not significant enough.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.440]   Then there was no cometary tail,
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.100]   no dust, no gas around this object.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.840]   And the Spitzer Space Telescope really searched very deeply
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.960]   for carbon-based molecules.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.320]   There was nothing.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.200]   So it's definitely not a comet
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   the way people expected it to be.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.060]   - Can you maybe briefly mention what properties a comet
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.900]   that you're referring to usually has?
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.680]   - Right, so a comet is a rock
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.700]   that has some water ice on the surface.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.040]   So you can think of it as an icy rock.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.440]   Actually, comets were discovered a long time ago,
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:12.440]   but the first model that was developed for them
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.320]   was by Fred Wippel, who was at Harvard.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.440]   And I think the legend goes that he got the idea
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.460]   from walking through Harvard Square
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.260]   and seeing, during a winter day,
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.720]   and seeing these icy rocks.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.640]   - So a comet is icy, and an asteroid is not.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.120]   - It's just a rock. - It's just a rock.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.280]   - Yeah, so when you have ice on the surface,
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.120]   when the rock gets close to the sun,
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.160]   the sunlight warms it up,
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.560]   and the ice sublimates, evaporates.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.800]   'Cause the one thing about ice, water ice,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.400]   is it doesn't become liquid if you warm it up in vacuum,
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.180]   without an external pressure.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.520]   It just goes straight into gas.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.440]   And that's what you see as the tail of a comet.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.320]   - Wow.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.620]   - The only way to get liquid water
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.200]   is to have an atmosphere, like on Earth,
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.020]   that has an external pressure.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.680]   Only then you get liquid.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.520]   And that's why it's essential to have an atmosphere
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.160]   to a planet in order to have liquid water
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.640]   and the chemistry of life.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.480]   So if you look at Mars, Mars lost its atmosphere,
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.680]   and therefore, no liquid water on the surface anymore.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.220]   I mean, there may have been early,
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.380]   and that's what the Perseverance survey,
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.760]   the Perseverance mission will try to find out,
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.260]   whether it had liquid water,
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.740]   whether there was life, perhaps, on it at the time.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.420]   But at some point, it lost its atmosphere,
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.260]   and then the liquid water was gone.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.820]   So the only reason that we can live on Earth
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.700]   is because of the atmosphere.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.580]   But a comet is in vacuum, pretty much,
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.500]   and when it gets warmed up on the surface,
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.360]   the water becomes, the water ice becomes gas,
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.960]   and then you see this cometary tail behind it.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.000]   In addition to water, there are all kinds
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.320]   of carbon-based molecules, or dust,
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.000]   that comes off the surface.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.420]   - And those are detectable.
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.800]   - Yeah, it's easy to detect.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.320]   It's very prominent.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.720]   You see these cometary tails that look very prominent
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.440]   because they reflect sunlight, and you can see them.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.680]   In fact, it's sometimes difficult
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.760]   to see the nucleus of the comet
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.460]   because it's surrounded and shrouded with,
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.860]   and in this case, there was no trace of anything.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.180]   - That's fascinating. - Now, you might say,
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.220]   "Okay, it's not a comet."
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.540]   So that's what the community said.
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.840]   "Okay, it's not a, no problem, it's still a rock.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.960]   "It's not a comet, but it's just a rock, bare rock.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.300]   "Okay, no problem."
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.060]   Then, and that's the thing that convinced me
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.180]   to write about it, and then in June 2018,
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.140]   significantly later, there was a report
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.160]   that in fact the object exhibited an excess push
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.120]   in addition to the force of gravity.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.300]   So the sun acts on it by gravity,
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.000]   but then there was an extra push on this object
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.040]   that was figured out from the orbit that you can trace.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.160]   And the question was, what is this excess push?
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.360]   So for comets, you get the rocket effect.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.040]   When you evaporate gas, just like a jet engine
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.560]   on an airplane, a jet engine is very simple.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.180]   You throw the gas back, and it pushes the airplane forward.
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.760]   That's all, that's how it's done.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.840]   So in a case of a comet, you throw gas
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.920]   in the direction of the sun, and then you get a push.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.480]   So in the case of comets, you can get a push,
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.560]   but there was no cometary tail.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.840]   So then people said, "Oh, wait a second.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.000]   "Is it an asteroid?"
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.560]   No, but it behaves like a comet,
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.340]   but it doesn't look like a comet.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.820]   So what, well, forget about it, business as usual.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.960]   - So that's what they mean by non-gravitation,
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.440]   non-gravitational acceleration.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.800]   So that's interesting.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.680]   So the primary force acting on something
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.080]   like just a rock, like an asteroid,
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.360]   would be, you can predict the trajectory based on--
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.200]   - Gravity.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   - Based on gravity.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.120]   And so here, there's detected movement
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.320]   that cannot be accounted purely by the gravity of the sun.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.660]   - And if it was a comet, you would need about a 10th
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.240]   of the mass of this comet, the weight of this comet,
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   to be evaporated in order to give it--
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.440]   - And there was no sign of that.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.320]   - No sign, 10% of the mass evaporating, it's huge.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.760]   Think about it, a 100-meter-sized object
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   losing 10% of its mass.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.560]   You can't miss that.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.400]   And--
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.720]   - So that's super weird.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.560]   - It's super weird.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.040]   - Is there a good, is there in your mind
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.880]   a possible explanation for this?
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.280]   - You know, so I operated just like Sherlock Holmes
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.400]   in a way. (Lex laughs)
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.280]   I said, "Okay, what are the possibilities?"
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.760]   And the only thing I could think,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.700]   so I ruled out everything else,
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.840]   and I said, "It must be the sunlight reflected off it."
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.840]   Okay, so the sunlight reflects off the surface
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.880]   and gives it a push, just like you get a push on a sail
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.160]   on a boat, you know, from the wind reflecting off it.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.160]   Now, in order for this to be effective,
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.020]   it turns out the object needs to be extremely thin.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:07.040]   It turns out it needs to be less than a millimeter thick.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.840]   Nature does not produce such things.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.280]   So, but we produce it because it's called
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.400]   the technology of a light sail.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.200]   So we are, for space exploration,
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.100]   we are exploring this technology
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.320]   because it has the benefit of not needing
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.600]   to carry the fuel with the spacecraft.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.360]   So you don't have the fuel, you just have a sail,
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.400]   and it's being pushed either by sunlight
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.900]   or by a laser beam or whatever.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.600]   So perhaps this is a light sail.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.480]   - So this is actually the same technology
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.160]   with the Starshot project.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.760]   - Yes, so people afterwards say,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.280]   "Okay, you work on this project, you imagine."
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.640]   - No, that's a pretty good explanation, right?
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.840]   - Obviously my imagination is limited by what I know.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.400]   So I would not deny that working on light sails
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.960]   expanded my ability to imagine this possibility.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.160]   But let me offer another interesting anecdote.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.360]   In September this year, 2020,
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.960]   there was another object found,
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.320]   and it was given the name 2020SO
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.800]   by the Minor Planet Center.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.480]   This is an organization actually in Cambridge, Massachusetts
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.880]   that gives names to objects, astronomical objects
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.920]   found in the solar system.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.240]   And they gave it that name, 2020SO,
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.560]   because it looked like an object in the solar system,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.960]   and it moved in an orbit that is similar
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.600]   to the orbit of the Earth,
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.560]   but not the same exactly.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.480]   And therefore it was bound to the sun,
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.740]   but it also exhibited a deviation
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.200]   from what you expect based on gravity.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.960]   So astronomers that found it extrapolated back in time
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   and found that in 1966, it intercepted the Earth.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.880]   And then they realized, they went to the history books,
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.080]   and they realized, oh, there was a mission
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.920]   called Lunar Surveyor, Lunar Lander, Surveyor 2,
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.840]   that had a rocket booster.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.320]   It was a failed mission, but there was a rocket booster
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.540]   that was kicked into space.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.280]   And presumably this is the rocket booster
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.320]   that we are seeing.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.440]   Now, this rocket booster was sufficiently hollow and thin
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.740]   for us to recognize that it's pushed by sunlight.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.240]   So here is my point.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.640]   We can tell from the orbit of an object,
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.960]   obviously this object didn't have any cometary tail,
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.920]   it was artificially made.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.560]   We know that it was made by us.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.400]   And it did deviate from an orbit of a rock.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.640]   So just by seeing something that doesn't have cometary tail
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.600]   and deviates from an orbit shaped by gravity,
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.560]   we can tell that it's artificial.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.280]   In the case of Oumuamua,
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.000]   it couldn't have been sent by humans
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.200]   because it just passed near us for a few months.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.160]   We know exactly what we were doing at that time.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.600]   And also it was moving faster than any object
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.040]   that we can launch.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.680]   And so obviously it came from outside the solar system.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.880]   And the question is who produced it?
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.440]   Now, I should say that when I walk on vacation on the beach,
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.440]   I often see natural objects like seashells
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.360]   that are beautiful and I look at them.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.640]   And every now and then I stumble on a plastic bottle
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.620]   and that was artificially produced.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.160]   And my point is that maybe Oumuamua
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.600]   was a message in a bottle.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.520]   And this is simply another window into searching
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.220]   for artifacts from other civilizations.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.320]   - Where do you think it could have come from?
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.640]   And if it's, so, okay.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.560]   From a scientific perspective,
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.600]   the narrow-minded view,
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.640]   as we'll probably talk about throughout,
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.880]   is you kinda wanna stick to the things
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.360]   to naturally originating objects like asteroids and comets.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.480]   Okay, that's the space of possible hypotheses.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.080]   And then if we expand beyond that,
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.440]   you start to think, okay,
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.920]   these are artificially constructed.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.120]   Like you just said, it could be by humans.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.480]   It could be by whatever that means
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.240]   by some kind of extraterrestrial alien civilizations.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:28.300]   If it's the alien civilization variety,
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.960]   what is this object then that we're looking at?
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.800]   - An excellent question.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.640]   And let me lay out,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.760]   I mean, we don't have enough evidence to tell.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.840]   If we had a photograph,
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.760]   perhaps we would have more information.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.420]   But there is one other peculiar fact about Oumuamua.
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.440]   Well, other than it was very shiny,
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.200]   that I didn't mention,
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.000]   we didn't detect any heat from it.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.400]   And that implies that it's rather small and shiny.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.020]   But the other peculiar fact is that
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.140]   it came from a very special frame of reference.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.780]   So it's sort of like finding a car in a parking lot,
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.980]   in a public parking lot,
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.540]   that you can't really tell where it came from.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.100]   So there is this frame of reference
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.620]   where you average over the motions of all the stars
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.500]   in the neighborhood of the sun.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:23.220]   So you find the so-called local standard of rest
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.660]   of the galaxy.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.680]   And that's a frame of reference
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.800]   that is obtained by averaging the random motions
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.640]   of all the stars.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.020]   And the sun is moving relative to that frame at some speed.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.840]   But this object was at rest in that frame.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.400]   And only one in 500 stars is so much at rest in that frame.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.200]   And that's why I was saying it's like a parking lot.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.160]   It was parked there and we bumped into it.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.320]   So the relative speed between the solar system
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.480]   and this object is just because we are moving.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.720]   It was sitting still.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.560]   Now you ask yourself,
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.640]   why is it so unusual in that context?
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.560]   You know why?
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.000]   Because if it was expelled from another planetary system,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.160]   most likely it will carry the speed of the host star
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.520]   that it came from.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.500]   Because the most loosely bound objects
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.620]   are in the periphery of the planetary system
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.240]   and they move very slowly relative to the star.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.000]   And so they carry, when they are ripped apart
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.200]   from the planetary system,
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.560]   most of the objects will have the residual motion
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.960]   of the star, roughly, relative to the local star.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.800]   But this one was at rest in the local.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.960]   Now, one thing I can think of,
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.080]   if there is a grid of road posts,
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.440]   you know, like for navigation system,
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.760]   so that you can find your way in the local frame,
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.480]   then that would be one possibility.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.600]   - These are like little sensors of,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.640]   that's fascinating to think about.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.000]   So there could be, I mean, not necessarily,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.360]   literally a grid, but just evenly,
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.760]   in some definition of evenly spread out
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.840]   set of objects like these that are just out there.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.000]   - A lot of them.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.040]   Another possibility is that these are relay stations,
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.620]   you know, for communication.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.400]   You might think in order to communicate,
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:11.480]   you need a huge beacon, a very powerful beacon,
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.680]   but it's not true.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.200]   Even on Earth, you know, we have these relay stations.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.600]   So you have a not so powerful beacon,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.720]   so it can be heard only out to a limited distance,
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.040]   but then you relay the message.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.800]   And it could be one of those.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.920]   Now, after it collided with the solar system,
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.000]   of course, it got a kick.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.240]   So it's just like a billiard ball, you know,
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.980]   we gave it a kick by colliding with,
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.280]   but most of them are not colliding with stars.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.440]   So that's one possibility, okay?
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.400]   And there should be lots of them, if that's the case.
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.940]   The other possibility is that it's a probe, you know,
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:51.200]   that was sent in the direction of the
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.520]   habitable region around the sun
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.080]   to find out if there is life.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.680]   Now, it takes tens of thousands of years
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.960]   for such a probe to traverse the solar system
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.240]   from the outer edge of the Oort cloud
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.620]   all the way to where we are.
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.120]   And, you know, it's a long journey.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.320]   So when it started the journey
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.120]   from the edge of the solar system to get to us now,
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.680]   you know, we were rather primitive back then, you know,
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.880]   we still didn't have any technology.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.620]   There was no reason to visit, you know,
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.620]   there was grass around and so forth.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.800]   But, you know, maybe it is a probe.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.740]   - So you said 10,000 years, that's fastest.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.660]   So it takes that long.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.860]   - Tens of thousands, yes.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.900]   - Tens of thousands of years.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.500]   - Yeah, and the other thing I should say is,
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.500]   you know, it could be just an outer layer of something else,
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.540]   like, you know, something that was ripped apart,
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.300]   like a surface of an instrument that was,
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.460]   and you can have lots of these pieces, you know,
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.060]   something breaks, lots of these pieces spread out,
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.620]   like space junk.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.220]   And, you know, that--
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.700]   - It could be just space junk
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.900]   from an alien civilization.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:57.980]   - Yes.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.820]   - So it's--
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.060]   - I should tell you about space junk.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:01.900]   Let me--
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.740]   - Yes, what do you mean by space junk?
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:07.220]   - So I think, you know, you might ask,
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.260]   why aren't they looking for us?
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.060]   One possibility is that we are not interesting,
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:11.900]   like we were talking about--
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.140]   - Yeah, the ants hypothesis.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.020]   - Another possibility, you know,
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.300]   if they are millions or billions of years
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.880]   into their technological development,
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.880]   they created their own habitat, their own cocoon,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.100]   where they feel comfortable, they have everything they need,
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.420]   and it's risky for them to establish communication
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:37.020]   with other, so they have their own cocoon,
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.420]   and they close off.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.020]   They don't care about anything else.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.020]   Now, in that case, you might say,
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.820]   oh, so how can we find about them if they are closed off?
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.460]   The answer is, they still have to deposit trash, right?
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.500]   That is something from the law of thermodynamics.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.020]   There must be some production of trash.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.700]   And, you know, we can still find about them
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.300]   just like investigative journalists
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.060]   going through the trash cans of celebrities in Hollywood.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.780]   You know, you can learn about the private lives
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.180]   of those celebrities by looking at the trash.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.100]   - It's fascinating to think, you know,
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.500]   if we are the ants in this picture,
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.420]   if this thing is a water bottle,
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.100]   or if it's like a smartphone,
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:23.100]   like where on the spectrum of possible objects of space,
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.340]   'cause there's a lot of interesting trash.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.500]   - Right. (laughs)
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.140]   - So like, how interesting is this trash possible?
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.380]   - But imagine a caveman seeing a cell phone.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.660]   The caveman would think,
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.340]   since the caveman played with rocks all of his life,
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.700]   he would say, it's a rock,
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.820]   just like my fellow astronomers said.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.820]   - Yes. - Right?
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.660]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.100]   That's brilliantly put.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.220]   Actually, as a scientist,
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.420]   do you hope it's a water bottle or a smartphone?
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.260]   Because--
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.220]   - I hope it's even more than a smartphone.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.460]   I hope that it's something that is really sophisticated.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.300]   - That's funny.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.460]   - Yeah. - See, I'm the opposite.
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.740]   I feel like I hope it's a water bottle
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.060]   because at least we have a hope
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.900]   with our current set of skills to understand it.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.300]   - Yeah, but-- - A caveman has no way
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.700]   of understanding the smartphone.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.020]   It's like, it will be,
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.500]   like, I feel like a caveman has more to learn
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.940]   from the plastic water bottle
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.580]   than it'll do from the smartphone.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.100]   - But suppose we figure it out,
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.700]   if we, for example, come close to it
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.980]   and learn what it's made of.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.380]   - And I guess a smartphone is full of, like,
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:22.100]   thousands of different technologies
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.860]   that we could probably pick at.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.220]   Do you have a sense of where,
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.700]   a hypothesis of where is the cocoon
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.820]   that it might have come from?
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:38.620]   - No, because, okay, so first of all,
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.100]   you know, the solar system,
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.140]   the outermost edge of the solar system
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.780]   is called the Oort cloud.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.980]   It's a cloud of icy rocks
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:52.020]   of different sizes that were left over
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.020]   from the formation of the solar system.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.340]   - Yes. - And it's thought to be
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.940]   roughly a ball or a sphere.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.900]   And it's halfway, the extent of it
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.460]   is roughly halfway to the nearest star, okay?
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:09.100]   So you can imagine each planetary system
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:14.100]   basically touching the Oort clouds of those stars
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.580]   that are near us are touching each other.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.820]   Space is full of these billiard balls
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.380]   that are very densely packed.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.140]   And what that means is any object that you see,
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.420]   irrespective of whether it came from the local standard,
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.340]   so we said that this object is special
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.140]   because it came from a local standard of rest,
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.580]   but even if it didn't,
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.820]   you would never be able to trace where it came from
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.820]   because all these Oort clouds overlap.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.540]   So if you take some direction in the sky,
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.220]   you will cross as many stars as you have
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.180]   in that direction.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:52.420]   Like there is no way to tell which Oort cloud it came from.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.180]   - So yes, I didn't realize how densely packed everything was
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.140]   from the perspective of the Oort cloud.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.140]   And that's really interesting.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.020]   So yeah, it could be nearby, it could be very far away.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.860]   - Yeah, we have no clue.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:08.260]   You said cocoon and you kind of paint,
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.580]   I think in the book,
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.340]   I've read a lot of your articles too
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.300]   on the Scientific American, which are brilliant.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.660]   So I'm kind of mixing things up in my head a little bit.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:22.100]   But there's, what does that cocoon look like?
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.620]   What does a civilization that's able to harness
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:29.020]   the power of multiple suns, for example, look like?
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.060]   When you imagine possible civilizations
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.140]   that are a million years more advanced than us,
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.980]   what do you think that actually looks like?
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:40.300]   - I think it's very different than we can imagine.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.460]   By the way, I should start from the point
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.220]   that even biological life,
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.980]   just without technology getting into the game,
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.180]   could look like something we have never seen before.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.260]   Take, for example, the nearest star,
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.980]   which is Proxima Centauri.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.460]   It's four and a quarter light years away.
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:03.100]   So they will know about the results of the 2016 elections
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.140]   only next month in February, 2021.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.500]   It's very far away.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.660]   But if you think about it,
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:17.340]   this star is a dwarf star,
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.260]   and it's much cooler than,
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:23.060]   it's twice as cold as the sun, okay?
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.020]   And it emits mostly infrared radiation.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:30.980]   So if there are any creatures on the planet close to it
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.300]   that is habitable, which is called Proxima b,
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.100]   there is a planet in the habitable zone,
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.140]   in the zone just at the right distance
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.260]   where in principle liquid water can be on the surface.
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.020]   If there are any animals there,
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.860]   they have infrared eyes because our eyes
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.580]   was designed to be sensitive
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.140]   to where most of the sunlight is in the visible range.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.940]   But Proxima Centauri emits mostly infrared.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.500]   So, you know, the nearest- - Who's not able
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.660]   to see each other? (laughs)
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.380]   - In the nearest star system,
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.260]   these animals would be quite strange.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.700]   They would have eyes that are detectors of infrared,
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.180]   very different from ours.
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.500]   Moreover, this planet, Proxima b,
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.540]   faces the star always with the same side.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:16.180]   So it has a permanent day side and a permanent night side.
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.060]   And obviously the creatures that would evolve
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.620]   on the permanent day side, which is much warmer,
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.260]   would be quite different than those
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.740]   on the permanent night side.
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.820]   Between them, there would be a permanent sunset strip.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.060]   And my daughters said that that's the best opportunity
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.220]   for high-value real estate
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:38.860]   'cause you will see the sunset throughout your life, right?
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.660]   The sun never sets on this strip.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.180]   So, you know, these worlds are out of our imagination.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.220]   - Just even the individual creatures,
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.380]   the sensor suite that they're operating with
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.220]   might be very different.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.060]   - Very different.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.820]   So I think when we see something like that,
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.220]   we would be shocked.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.100]   Not to speak about seeing technology.
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.540]   Now, so I don't even dare to imagine, you know?
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.900]   And I think, you know,
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.540]   obviously we can bury our head in the sand
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:10.340]   and say it's never aliens, like many of my colleagues say.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.020]   And it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.300]   If you never look, you will never find.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.780]   If you are not ready to find wonderful things,
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.460]   you will never discover them.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.020]   And the other thing I would like to say is
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.500]   reality doesn't care whether you ignore it or not.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.980]   You can ignore reality, but it's still there.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:32.500]   So we can all agree based on Twitter
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.060]   that aliens don't exist, that Oumuamua was a rock.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:38.060]   We can all agree.
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.100]   And you will get a lot of likes.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.260]   We will have a big crowd of supporters
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.100]   and everyone will be happy and give each other awards
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.980]   and honors and so forth.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.980]   But Oumuamua might still be an alien artifact.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.460]   Who cares what humans agree on?
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.300]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.540]   - There is a reality out there.
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.700]   And we have to be modest enough to recognize
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.820]   that we should make our statements based on evidence.
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.420]   Science is not about ourself.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.020]   It's not about glorifying our image.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.620]   It's not about getting honors, prizes, you know?
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.900]   A lot of the scientific, a lot of the academic activity
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.420]   is geared towards creating your echo chamber
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.820]   where you have students, postdocs
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:23.860]   repeating your mantras so that your voice is heard loudly
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.420]   so that you can get more honors, prizes, recognition.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.220]   That's not the purpose of science.
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.940]   The purpose is to figure out what nature is, right?
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.620]   And in the process of doing that,
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.820]   it's a learning experience.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.420]   You make mistakes.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.620]   Einstein made three mistakes at the end of his career.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.220]   He argued that in the 1930s,
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.740]   he argued that black holes don't exist,
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.100]   gravitational waves don't exist,
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:52.580]   and quantum mechanics doesn't have spooky action
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.780]   at a distance.
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.540]   And all three turned out to be wrong, okay?
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.860]   So the point is that if you work at the frontier,
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:00.940]   then you make mistakes.
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:04.140]   It's inevitable because you can't tell what is true or not.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:08.180]   And avoiding making mistakes in order to preserve your image
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.380]   makes you extremely boring, okay?
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.220]   You will get a prize, but you will be a boring scientist
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:17.300]   because you will keep repeating things we already know.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.180]   If you want to make progress, if you want to innovate,
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.660]   you have to take risks,
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.940]   and you have to look at the evidence.
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:25.940]   It's a dialogue with nature.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:28.340]   You don't know the truth in advance.
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.100]   You let nature tell you, educate you,
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.300]   and then you realize that what you thought before
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.560]   is incorrect.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.580]   And a lot of my colleagues prefer to be in a state
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.940]   where they have a monologue.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.020]   You know, if you look at these people
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.460]   that work on string theory, they have a monologue.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.180]   They know what, and in fact,
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.340]   their monologue is centered on anti-de Sitter space,
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.140]   which we don't live in now.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.060]   You know, to me, it's just like the Olympics.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.460]   You know, you define 100 meters,
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.940]   and you say, "Whoever runs this 100 meters
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.660]   "is the best athlete, the fastest," you know?
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.580]   And it's completely arbitrary.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:08.140]   You could have decided it would be 50 meters or 20 meters.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:08.980]   Who cares?
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.300]   You just measure the ability of people this way.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.300]   So you define anti-de Sitter space
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.620]   as a space where you do your mathematical gymnastics,
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.500]   and then you find who can do it the best,
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.540]   and you give jobs based on that, you give prizes based.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.420]   But as we said before, you know,
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.500]   nature doesn't care about, you know,
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:28.360]   the prizes that you give to each other.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.540]   It cares, you know, it has its own reality,
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:34.660]   and we should figure it out, and it's not about us.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.700]   The scientific activity is about figuring out nature.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.340]   And sometimes we may be wrong.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.060]   Our image will not be preserved,
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.740]   but that's the fun, you know?
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.020]   Kids explore the world out of curiosity,
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.700]   and I always want to maintain my childhood curiosity,
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.300]   and I don't care about the labels that I have.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:59.140]   In fact, having tenure is exactly the opportunity
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.420]   to behave like a child because you can make mistakes.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.220]   And I was asked by the Harvard Gazette,
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.120]   you know, the Pravda of Harvard,
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.500]   (Sami laughs)
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:12.880]   what is the one thing that you would like
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.980]   to change about the world?
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.760]   And I said, I would like my colleagues
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.060]   to behave more like kids.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.080]   That's the one thing I would like them to do
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.860]   because something bad happens to these kids
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.700]   when they become tenured professors.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.940]   They start to worry about their ego
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:33.620]   and about themselves more than about the purpose of science,
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.820]   which is, you know, curiosity-driven,
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.300]   figuring out from evidence.
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.780]   Evidence is the key.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:41.820]   So when an object shows anomalies, like Oumuamua,
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.460]   what's the problem discussing, you know,
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.100]   whether it's artificial or not?
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.540]   You know, so there was, I should tell you,
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.940]   there was a mainstream paper in Nature
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.740]   published saying it must be natural.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.060]   That's it.
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.460]   It's unusual, but it must be natural, period.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.980]   And then at the same time,
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:04.260]   some other mainstream scientists
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.160]   tried to explain the properties.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.660]   And they came up with interpretations like,
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.380]   it's a dust bunny, you know,
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.900]   the kind that you find in a household,
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.040]   a collection of dust particles pushed by sunlight.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.380]   Something we have never seen before.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.580]   Or it's a hydrogen iceberg.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.740]   It actually evaporates like a comet,
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:25.260]   but hydrogen is transparent, you don't see it,
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.260]   and that's why we don't see the cometary tail.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.340]   Again, we have never seen something like that.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.500]   In both cases, the objects would not survive
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.900]   the long journey.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.820]   We discussed it in a paper that I wrote afterwards.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.500]   But my point is, those that tried to explain
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.980]   the unusual properties went into great length
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:47.020]   at discussing things that we have never seen before.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.840]   So even when you think about the natural origin,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.180]   you have to come up with scenarios
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.120]   of things that were never seen before.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.920]   And by the way, they look less plausible to me, personally.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.980]   But my point is, if we discuss things
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.540]   that were never seen before,
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:06.940]   why not discuss, why not contemplate an artificial origin?
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:07.920]   What's the problem?
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.940]   Why do people have this pushback?
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.800]   I worked on dark matter,
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.500]   and we don't know what most of the matter in the universe is.
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.640]   It's called dark matter.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.000]   It's just an acronym because we have no clue.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:23.940]   We simply don't know.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.800]   So it could be all kinds of particles.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.480]   And over the years, people suggested
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.320]   weakly interacting massive particles,
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.440]   axions, all kinds of particles.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.620]   And experiments were made.
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.480]   They cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:39.040]   They put upper limits, constraints,
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   that ruled out many of the possibilities
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.960]   that were proposed as natural initially.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.960]   The mainstream community regarded it
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.480]   as a mainstream activity
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.640]   to search the nature of the dark matter.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.320]   And nobody complained that it's speculative
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:56.280]   to consider weakly interacting massive particles.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.000]   Now, I ask you, why is it speculative
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.920]   to consider extraterrestrial technologies?
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:06.400]   We have a proof that it exists here on Earth.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.960]   We also know that the conditions of Earth
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.140]   are reproduced in billions of systems
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.920]   throughout the Milky Way galaxy.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.400]   So what's more conservative than to say
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.000]   if you arrange for similar conditions,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.440]   you get the same outcome?
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.480]   How can you imagine this to be speculative?
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.840]   It's not speculative at all.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.400]   And nevertheless, it's regarded the periphery.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.320]   And at the same time, you have physicists,
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.440]   theoretical physicists, working on extra dimensions,
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:36.040]   supersymmetry, superstring theory,
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.080]   the multiverse, maybe we live in a simulation,
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:43.480]   all of these ideas that have no grounding in reality,
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.400]   some of which sound to me like, you know,
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.000]   just like what someone would say--
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.760]   - Science fiction, basically.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.880]   - Because you have no way to test it, you know,
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.440]   through experiments, and experiments really are key.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.880]   It's not just the nuance.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.680]   You say, okay, forget about the experiment.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.440]   As some philosophers try to say,
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.880]   you know, if there is a consensus, what's the problem?
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:08.040]   The point is, it's key, and that's what Galileo found.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.520]   It's key to have feedback from reality.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.960]   You know, you can think that you have a billion dollar,
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.600]   or that you are more rich than, you know, Elon Musk.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.800]   That's fine, you can feel very happy about it.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.640]   You can talk about it with your friends,
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.800]   and all of you will be happy,
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.960]   and think about what you can do with the money.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.820]   Then you go to an ATM machine, and you make an experiment.
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:32.320]   You check how much money you have in your checking account.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.640]   And if it turns out that, you know, you don't have much,
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.400]   you can't materialize your dreams.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.080]   Okay, so you realize, you have a reality check.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.200]   And my point is, without experiments,
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.560]   giving you a reality check, without the ATM machine
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.720]   showing you whether your ideas are bankrupt or not,
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.280]   without putting skin in the game,
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.400]   and by skin in the game, I mean,
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.960]   don't just talk about theoretical ideas.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.560]   Make them testable.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.680]   If you don't make them testable, they're worthless.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:05.000]   They're just like theology that is not testable.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.840]   By the way, theology has some tests.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:08.680]   Let me give you--
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.880]   - (laughs) That's interesting.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:10.720]   - Three examples.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.540]   - Yes.
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:15.760]   - It turns out that my book already inspired
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.240]   a PhD student at Harvard in the English department
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.000]   to pursue a PhD in that direction.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.580]   And she invited me to the PhD exam a couple of months ago.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:31.560]   And in the exam, one of the examiners, a professor,
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.760]   asked her, "Do you know why Giordano Bruno
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.640]   "was burnt at the stake?"
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:42.620]   And she said, "I think it's because he was an obnoxious guy
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:45.520]   "and irritated a lot of people."
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:46.400]   Which is true.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:51.940]   But the professor said, "No, it's because Giordano Bruno
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:55.520]   "said that other stars are just like the sun,
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:00.720]   "and they could have a planet like the Earth around them
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.400]   "that could host life."
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.720]   And that was offensive to the church.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.320]   Why was it offensive?
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.040]   Because there is the possibility that this life sinned.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:16.720]   And if that life sinned on planets around other stars,
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.380]   it should have been saved by Christ.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.400]   And then you need multiple copies of Christ,
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.980]   and that's unacceptable.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.320]   How can you have duplicates of Christ?
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:28.760]   And so they burned the guy.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:34.240]   - It was about, okay, I'm just loading this all in
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.720]   'cause that's kind of brilliant.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.640]   So he was actually already, it's not just about the stars,
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.300]   it's anticipating that there could be other life forms.
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.640]   Like why, if there's other stars,
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.920]   why would our star be special?
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.240]   - He was making the right argument.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.280]   - And he would just follow that all along to say
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.160]   there should be other Earth-like places,
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.320]   there should be other life forms.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.720]   And then there needs to be copies of Christ.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.120]   - Yeah, so that was offensive.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:05.120]   So I said to that professor, I said, "Great."
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.720]   I wanted to introduce some scientific tone
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.400]   to the discussion.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:12.480]   And I said, "This is great because now you basically
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.920]   "laid the foundation for an experimental test
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.300]   "of this theology.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:17.900]   "What is the test?
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:20.760]   "We now know that other stars are like the sun,
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:23.300]   "and we know they have planets like the Earth around them.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.560]   "So suppose we find life there,
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:28.700]   "and we figure out that they sinned.
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:32.440]   "Then we ask them, did you witness Christ?
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:36.540]   "And if they say no, it means that this theology
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.160]   "is ruled out."
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.500]   So there is an experimental test.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.360]   So this is experimental test number one.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.900]   Another experimental test.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:49.000]   In the Bible, in the Old Testament, Abraham
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.540]   was heard the voice, the voice of God,
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:58.160]   to sacrifice his son, right?
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.120]   Only son.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.720]   And that's what the story says.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:05.600]   Now suppose Abraham, my name, by the way,
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:10.020]   had a voice memo up on his cell phone.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:13.440]   He could have pressed this up and recorded the voice of God,
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.160]   and that would have been experimental evidence
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.800]   that God exists, right?
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.220]   Fortunately, he didn't.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.280]   But it's an experimental test, right?
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.560]   There is a third example I should tell,
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:28.940]   and that is Elie Wiesel attributed this story
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:32.080]   to Martin Buber, but it's not clear whether it's true or not.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:36.280]   At any event, the story goes that Martin Buber,
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:39.040]   he was a philosopher, and he said,
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:44.040]   "The Christians argue that the Messiah arrived already,
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:48.140]   "and will come back again in the future.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:52.380]   "The Jews argue the Messiah never came,
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.640]   "and will arrive in the future."
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.940]   So he said, "Why argue?
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:00.860]   "Both sides agree that the Messiah will arrive
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:02.240]   "in the future.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.620]   "When the Messiah arrives, we can ask whether he or she
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:10.380]   "came before," you know, like visited us,
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.400]   and then figure it out, and one side.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.040]   So again, experimental test of a theology.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:20.040]   So even theology, if it puts a skin in the game,
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.240]   if it makes a prediction, could be tested, right?
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.960]   So why can't string theories test themselves?
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.400]   Or why can't, you know, even cosmic inflation,
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.200]   that's another model that, you know,
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.500]   one of the inventors from MIT, Alan Guth,
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.420]   argues that it's not falsifiable.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:39.400]   My point is a theory that cannot be falsified
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.580]   is not helpful, because it means
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.820]   that you can't make progress.
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:45.360]   You cannot improve your understanding of nature.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:48.040]   The only way for us to learn about nature
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:51.960]   is by making hypotheses that are testable,
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.600]   doing the experiments, and learning
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.120]   whether we are correct or not.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.480]   - So be, and couple that with a curiosity
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.600]   and open-mindedness that allows us to explore
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.240]   all kinds of possible hypotheses,
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.840]   but always the pursuit of those,
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.240]   the scientific rigor around those hypotheses
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.720]   is ultimately get evidence.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:16.160]   - Knowledge is, of what nature is,
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.440]   should be a dialogue with nature,
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.360]   rather than a monologue.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.480]   - Monologue, beautifully put.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:24.160]   Can we talk a little bit about the Drake equation?
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.460]   Another framework from which to have
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.280]   this kind of discussion about
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.560]   possible civilizations out there.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.320]   So let me ask, within the context of the Drake equation,
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.680]   or maybe bigger, how many alien civilizations
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.400]   do you think are out there?
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.360]   - Well, it's hard to tell, 'cause the Drake equation
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.320]   is, again, quantifying our ignorance.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.280]   It's just a set of factors.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.880]   The only one that we know, or actually two
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.000]   that we know quite well is the rate of star formation
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.280]   in the Milky Way galaxy, which we measured by now,
[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.200]   and the frequency of planets like the Earth around stars,
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.080]   and at the right distance to have life.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:07.280]   But other than that, there are lots of implicit assumptions
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.320]   about all the other factors that will enable us
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.960]   to detect a signal.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.160]   Now, I should say the Drake equation
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.640]   has a very limited validity just for signals
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.440]   from civilizations that are transmitting
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.560]   at the time that you're observing them.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.040]   However, we can do much better than that.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.720]   We can look for artifacts that they left behind.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.680]   Even if they are dead, you can look for
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.240]   industrial pollution in the atmosphere of planets.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.040]   Why do I bring this up?
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.840]   Again, to show you the conservatism
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.400]   of the mainstream in astronomy.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.440]   By the way, I have leadership positions.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.760]   I was chair of the astronomy department for nine years,
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.240]   the longest serving chair at Harvard.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.600]   I'm the chair of the board on physics and astronomy
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.000]   of the National Academies.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.680]   It's a primary board.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:00.240]   I'm director of two centers at Harvard and so forth.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.760]   So I do represent the community in various ways,
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.600]   but at the same time, I'm a little bit disappointed
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.120]   by the conservatism that people have.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.120]   Let me give you an illustration of that.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.960]   So the astronomy community actually is going right now
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.280]   through the process of defining its goals
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.800]   for the next decade.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.080]   And there are proposals for telescopes
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.680]   that would cost billions of dollars
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:31.520]   and whose goal is to find evidence for oxygen
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.560]   in the atmosphere of planets around other stars
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.680]   with the idea that this would be a marker,
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.000]   a signature of life.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.680]   Now, the problem with that is Earth didn't have much oxygen
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.000]   in its atmosphere for the first two billion years.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.240]   Roughly half of its life, it didn't have much oxygen,
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.160]   but it had life.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.960]   It had microbial life.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.880]   It's not clear yet, as of yet, what the origin is
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.640]   for the rise in the oxygen level after two billion years,
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.260]   about 2.4 billion years ago.
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.760]   But we know that a planet can have life
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.760]   without oxygen in the atmosphere because Earth did it.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.840]   The second problem with this approach
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:19.280]   is that you can have oxygen from natural processes.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.400]   You can break water molecules and make oxygen.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.600]   So even if you find it, it will never tell you
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.840]   that for sure life exists there.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.300]   And so even with these billions of dollars,
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.480]   the mainstream community will never be confident
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.240]   whether there is life there.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.920]   Now, how can it be confident?
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.480]   There is actually a way.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.840]   If instead of looking with the same instruments,
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.120]   if you look for molecules that indicate industrial pollution,
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:49.200]   for example, CFCs that are produced
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.600]   by refrigerating systems or industries here on Earth,
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.640]   that they do the ozone layer, you can search for that.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.520]   And I wrote a paper five years ago suggesting that.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.160]   Now, what's the problem?
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.060]   You can just tell NASA, I want to build this telescope
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:08.420]   to search for oxygen, but also for industrial pollution.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.840]   Nobody would say that because it sounds like
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:15.820]   on the periphery of the field.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.520]   And I ask you, why would--
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.440]   - That's hilarious 'cause that's exactly, I mean--
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.320]   - Even just you saying it's quite brilliant.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.720]   I mean, 'cause it's a really strong signal.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.760]   And if there's alien civilizations out there,
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.720]   then there are probably going to be many of them,
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.360]   and they're probably going to be more advanced than us,
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.760]   and they're probably going to have something
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.140]   like industrial pollution, which would be
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:42.100]   a much stronger signal than some basic gas,
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.340]   which could have a lot of different explanations.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.100]   So like, somebody like oxygen, or, I mean, I don't,
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:51.860]   I mean, we could talk about signs of life on Venus
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.100]   and so on, but if you want a strong signal,
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.460]   it would be pollution.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.620]   I love how garbage is--
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.480]   - No, but the pollution, you have to understand,
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.660]   we think of pollution as a problem,
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:06.260]   but on a planet that was too cold, for example,
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.000]   to have a comfortable life on it,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.920]   you can imagine terraforming it and putting a blanket
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:16.560]   of polluting gases such that it will be warmer,
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.960]   and that would be a positive change.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.840]   So if an industrial or a technological civilization
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:27.440]   wants to terraform a planet that otherwise
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.760]   is too cold for them, they would do it.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.700]   So what's the problem of defining it as a search goal,
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.200]   using the same technologies?
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.200]   The problem is that there is a taboo.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.120]   We are not supposed to discuss extraterrestrial intelligence.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:47.240]   There is no funding for this subject, not much, very little,
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:51.240]   and young people, because of the bullying on Twitter,
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.080]   you know, all the social media and elsewhere,
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.080]   young people with talent that are curious
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:00.880]   about these questions do not enter this field of study,
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.480]   and obviously, if you step on the grass,
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.740]   it will never grow, right?
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:09.320]   So if you don't give funding, obviously, you know,
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.240]   the mainstream community says,
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.180]   "Look, nothing was discovered so far."
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.900]   Obviously, nothing would be discovered.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.100]   If talented people go to other disciplines,
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.500]   you never search for it well enough,
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.940]   you will never find anything.
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:23.660]   I mean, look at gravitational wave astrophysics.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.620]   It's a completely new window into the universe,
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.180]   pioneered by Ray Weiss at MIT,
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.180]   and at first, it was ridiculed,
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:33.900]   and thanks to some administrators
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.060]   at the National Science Foundation,
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:38.220]   it received funding, despite the fact
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.660]   that the mainstream of the astronomy community
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:43.700]   was very resistant to it,
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.340]   and now it's considered a frontier.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.740]   So all these people that I remember as a postdoc,
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.940]   a young postdoc, these people that bashed this field
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.740]   and said bad things about people,
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.380]   said nothing will come out of it,
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.180]   now they say, "Oh, yeah, of course."
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.500]   You know, the Nobel Prize was given
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.900]   to the LIGO collaboration.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:07.220]   Of course, now they are supportive of it,
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:12.220]   but my point is, if you suppress innovation early on,
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:15.100]   there are lots of missed opportunities.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.960]   The discovery of exoplanets is one example.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.460]   You know, in 1952, there was an astronomer
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:26.460]   called Otto Struve, and he wrote a paper saying,
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:31.460]   "Why don't we search for Jupiter-like planets
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.460]   "close to their host star?"
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.300]   Because if they're close enough,
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.140]   they would move the star back and forth
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.660]   and we can detect the signal, okay?
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:43.460]   And so astronomers on time allocation committees
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:47.300]   of telescopes for 40 years argued,
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.780]   "This is not possible because we know
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:53.560]   "why Jupiter resides so far from the sun.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.060]   "You cannot have Jupiter so close
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.860]   "because there is this region where ice forms
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:00.360]   "far from the sun, and beyond that region
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.420]   "is where Jupiter-like planets can form."
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.900]   There was a theory behind it,
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.580]   which ended up being wrong by today's standards.
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:10.660]   But anyway, they did not give time on telescopes
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.940]   to search for such systems until the first system
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:17.580]   was discovered four decades after Otto Struve's paper.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.100]   And the Nobel Prize was awarded to that
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.180]   just a couple of years ago.
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:25.420]   And you ask yourself, "Okay, so science still
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.500]   "made progress, what's the problem?"
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:31.500]   The problem is that this baby came out barely,
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.500]   and there was a delay of four decades,
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.100]   so the progress was delayed, and I wonder
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.180]   how many babies were not born because of this resistance.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.060]   So there must be ideas that are as good as this one
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.140]   that were suppressed because they were bullied,
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:48.100]   because people ridiculed them,
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:50.620]   that were actually good ideas.
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.660]   And these are missed opportunities,
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.580]   babies that were never born.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.020]   And I'm willing to push this frontier
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.840]   of the search for technologies
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.660]   or technological signatures for other civilization.
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:06.820]   Because when I was young, I was in the military in Israel,
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.660]   it's obligatory to serve.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:12.020]   And there was this saying that one of the soldiers
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:15.780]   sometimes has to put his body on the barbed wire
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.700]   so that others can go through.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.060]   And I'm willing to suffer the pain
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:24.260]   so that younger people in the future
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.980]   will be able to speak freely about the possibility
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:29.540]   that some of the anomalies we find in the sky
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.720]   are due to technological signatures.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.460]   - And it's quite obvious, this is why I like folks
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.020]   in the artificial intelligence space,
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:39.260]   Elon Musk and a few others speak about this,
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:41.000]   and they look at the long arc.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.220]   They say like, what, you know, this kind of,
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.540]   you can call it like first principles thinking,
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.580]   or you can call it anything really,
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:52.860]   is like if we just zoom off from our current bickering
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:57.380]   and our current discussions in what science is doing,
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.420]   look at the long arc of the trajectory
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.940]   we're headed at, which questions
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:06.700]   are obviously fundamental to science?
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:07.780]   And it should be asked.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:09.540]   And which is the space of hypotheses
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.700]   we should be exploring?
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.860]   And like exoplanets is a really good example
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:15.900]   of one that was like an obvious one.
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.740]   I recently talked to Sarah Seager,
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.940]   and it was very taboo when she was starting out
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:22.660]   to work on an exoplanet, and that was even in the '90s.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:23.500]   - Yeah.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.580]   - And like it's obvious should not be a taboo subject.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.780]   And to me, I mean, I'm probably ignorant,
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:32.900]   but to me exoplanets seems like it's ridiculous
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.220]   that that would ever be a taboo subject.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.060]   - Right.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.900]   - To not fund, to not explore.
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:40.700]   That's very, but even for her,
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:45.700]   it's now taboo to say like what, you know,
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:47.900]   to look for industrial pollution, right?
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:48.740]   - Right.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.500]   And I find that ridiculous.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:51.340]   I'll tell you why.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.160]   - Even if she can't take the next step.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.900]   - It's ridiculous for another reason.
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:54.740]   - Yes.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.860]   - Not because of just the scientific benefits
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.780]   that we might have by exploring it,
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:01.900]   but because the public cares about these questions.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:02.740]   - Yes, a lot.
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.940]   - And the public funds science.
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:07.780]   So how dare the scientists shy away
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:09.460]   from addressing these questions
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.940]   if they have the technology to do it?
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.180]   It's like saying,
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.100]   I don't want to look through Galileo's telescope.
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.200]   It's exactly the same.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.740]   You have the technology to explore this question,
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.940]   to find evidence, and you shy away from it.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.500]   You might ask, why do people shy away from it?
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.340]   - Yes.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:27.860]   - Perhaps it's because of the fact
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.900]   that there is science fiction.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.900]   I'm not a fan of science fiction
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:33.240]   because it has an element to it
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.820]   that violates the laws of physics
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.780]   in many of the books and the films.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:37.620]   - Magic.
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.900]   - And I cannot enjoy these things
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:42.140]   when I see the laws of physics violated.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.180]   But who cares that, you know,
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.740]   the fact that there is science fiction?
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.620]   I mean, if you have the scientific methodology
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:50.740]   to address the same subject,
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:53.160]   I don't care that other people, you know,
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.140]   spoke nonsense about this subject
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:56.860]   or said things that make no sense.
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.680]   Who cares?
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.300]   You do your scientific work
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.020]   just like you explore the dark matter.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:06.060]   You explore the possibility that Oumuamua is an artifact.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.020]   You just look for evidence
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:12.420]   and try to deduce what it means.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.940]   And I have no problem with doing that.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.060]   To me, it sounds like any other scientific question
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.420]   that we have, and given the public's interest,
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.540]   we have an obligation to do that.
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.660]   By the way, science to me
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:25.580]   is not an occupation of the elite.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:28.500]   It doesn't allow me to feel superior to other humans
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.180]   that are unable to understand the math.
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:33.060]   To me, it's a way of life.
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:35.180]   You know, if there is a problem in the faucet
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:37.660]   or in the pipe at home,
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.580]   I try to figure out what the problem is.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:41.660]   And with a plumber, we figure it out.
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:43.340]   And, you know, we look at the clues.
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:45.380]   And the same thing in science.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:46.820]   You know, you look at the evidence,
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.820]   you try to figure out what it means.
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:51.140]   It's common sense in a way.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.020]   And it shouldn't be regarded
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:56.460]   as something removed from the public.
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.140]   It should be a reflection of the public's interest.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.980]   And I think it's actually a crime
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.780]   to resist the public interest.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:05.340]   If the public says, "I care about this,"
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:06.180]   and you say, "No, no, no,
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.020]   "that's not sophisticated enough for me.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.860]   "I want to do intellectual gymnastics
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.500]   "on anti-de Sitter space,"
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.620]   to me, that's a crime.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.980]   - Yes, I 100% agree.
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:17.780]   So it's hilarious that the very,
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.380]   not hilarious, it's sad,
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:25.380]   that people who are trained in the scientific community
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:28.180]   to have the tools to explore this world,
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:31.620]   to be children, to be the most effective at being children,
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.900]   are the ones that resist being children the most.
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:38.540]   But there is a large number of people
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:43.540]   that embrace the childlike wonder about the world,
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.100]   and may not necessarily have the tools to do it.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.940]   That's the more general public.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:51.780]   And so I wonder if I could ask you
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:56.180]   and talk to you a little bit about UFO sightings.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:13:01.060]   That there's people, quote-unquote believers,
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:03.940]   there's hundreds of thousands of UFO sightings.
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:08.940]   And I've consumed some of the things
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.620]   that people have said about it.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:15.340]   And one thing I really like about it
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:20.340]   is how excited they are by the possibility,
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:23.700]   by, it's almost like this childlike wonder
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:24.940]   about the world out there.
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.540]   They're not, it's not a fear, it's an excitement.
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.940]   Do you think, 'cause we're talking about
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:35.540]   this possibly extraterrestrial object
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.820]   that visited, that flew by Earth,
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:39.940]   do you think it's possible that
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:43.000]   out of those hundreds of thousands of UFO sightings,
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:48.820]   one is an actual, one or some number
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.900]   is an actual sighting of a non-human,
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.540]   some alien technology?
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.840]   And that we're not,
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:00.060]   we did not, we're too close-minded
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:04.260]   to look and to see?
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.380]   - I think to answer this question,
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.220]   we need better evidence.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:12.540]   My starting point, as I said, out of modesty,
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.500]   is that we are not particularly interesting.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.020]   - Yes, I agree with you. - And therefore,
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.020]   I would be hard-pressed to imagine
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:21.100]   that someone wants to really spy on us.
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:25.240]   So I would think, as a starting point,
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.180]   that we don't deserve attention
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:30.640]   and we shouldn't expect someone, but who knows?
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.480]   Now, the problem that I have with UFO sighting reports
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.860]   is that 50 years ago, there were some reports
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.880]   of fuzzy images, saucer-like things.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.900]   By now, our technologies are much better,
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:48.020]   our cameras are much more sensitive.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:50.100]   These fuzzy images should have turned
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.620]   into crisp, clear images of things
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.380]   that we are confident about.
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:57.420]   And they haven't turned that way.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:00.340]   It's always on the borderline of believability.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.540]   And because of that, I believe that it might be,
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:05.260]   most likely, artifacts of our instruments
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:09.220]   or some natural phenomena that we are unable to understand.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.820]   Now, of course, the reason you need,
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:14.420]   you must examine those, if, for example,
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:18.220]   pilots report about them or the military
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.420]   finds evidence for them, is because it may pose
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.740]   a national security threat.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.780]   If another country has technologies
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:27.640]   that we don't know about and they're spying on us,
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.940]   we need to know about it.
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.700]   And therefore, we should examine everything
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:32.140]   that looks unusual.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:36.260]   But to associate it with an alien life
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.980]   is a little too far for me
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:42.540]   until we have evidence that stands up
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:45.620]   to the level of scientific credence,
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:49.260]   that we are 100% sure that,
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:54.140]   from multiple detectors and through a scientific process.
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.820]   Now, again, if the scientific community
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.340]   shies away from these reports, we will never have that.
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.780]   It's like saying, I don't want to take photographs
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:05.140]   of something because I know what it is,
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:07.180]   then you will never know what it is.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.120]   But I think if some science, if grants,
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.860]   let's put it this way, if funding will be given to scientists
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.820]   to follow on some of these reports
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:19.620]   and use scientific instruments that are capable
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:23.940]   of detecting those sightings with much better resolution,
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.420]   with much better information, that would be great
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.180]   because it will clarify the matter.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.420]   You know, these are not, as you said,
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.460]   you know, hundreds of thousands,
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.260]   these are not once in a lifetime events.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.580]   So it's possible to take scientific instrumentation
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:41.220]   and explore, go to the ocean where the, you know,
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.980]   someone reported that there are frequent events
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:47.220]   that are unusual and check it out.
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:48.900]   Do a scientific experiment, what's the problem?
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.960]   Why not, why only do experiments deep into the ocean
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:56.380]   and look at the oceanography or do other things?
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.300]   You know, we can do scientific investigation
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:02.620]   of these sightings and figure out what they mean.
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:04.740]   I'm very much in favor of that,
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.300]   but until we have the evidence,
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:09.540]   I would be doubtful as to what they actually mean.
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:10.700]   - Yeah, we'll have to be humble
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.380]   and acknowledge that we're not that interesting.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.060]   It's kind of, you're making me realize
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:17.540]   that because it's so taboo,
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:20.300]   that the people that have the equipment,
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.260]   meaning, and we're not just talking,
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:24.380]   everybody has cameras now,
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:29.380]   but to have a large-scale, like, sensor network
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.500]   that collects data, that regularly collects,
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.820]   just like we look at the weather,
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.420]   we're collecting information,
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:37.220]   and then we can then access that information
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.080]   when there is reports and, like,
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.500]   have it not be a taboo thing where there's, like,
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.660]   millions or billions of dollars funding this effort
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:49.660]   that, by the way, inspires millions of people.
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.260]   This is exactly what you're talking about.
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:55.900]   It's like, the scientific community is afraid of a topic
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.540]   that inspires millions of people.
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:58.740]   - Exactly. - It's absurd.
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:02.140]   But if you put blinders on your eyes, you don't see it.
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.620]   - Yeah. - Right.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:06.900]   I should say that we do have meteors that we see.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:09.340]   These are rocks that, by chance,
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:11.620]   happen to collide with the Earth.
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.980]   And if they're small, they burn up in the atmosphere,
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:17.500]   but if they're big enough,
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:20.780]   tens of meters or more, hundreds of meters,
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.780]   the outer layer burns up,
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:26.940]   but then the core of the object makes it through.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:29.780]   And this is our chance of putting our hands
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:34.380]   around an object if this meteor came from interstellar space.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:37.460]   So one path of discovery
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:40.380]   is to search for interstellar meteors.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.380]   And with a student of mine,
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:44.060]   we actually looked through the record
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.540]   and we thought that we found one example
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.480]   of a meteor that was reported
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:51.700]   that might have come from interstellar space.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:54.400]   - That's fantastic. - And another approach
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.500]   is, for example, to look at the moon.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.300]   The moon is different from the Earth
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.580]   in the sense that it doesn't have an atmosphere.
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:04.420]   So objects do not burn up on their way to it.
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.660]   It's sort of like a museum.
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:06.980]   It collects everything that comes--
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:09.300]   - Of rocks from out there in deep space, yeah.
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.900]   - And there is no geological activity on the moon.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.660]   So on Earth, every 100 million years,
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:17.300]   we could have had computer terminals on Earth
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:20.060]   that could have been a civilization like ours
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:24.300]   with electronic equipment more than 100 million years ago,
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:25.820]   and it's completely lost.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.740]   You cannot excavate and find evidence for it
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:30.700]   because in archeological digs,
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:34.660]   because the Earth is being mixed on these timescales,
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.420]   and everything that was on the surface
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:37.980]   more than 100 million years ago
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.100]   is buried deep inside the Earth right now
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:41.220]   because of geological activity.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.900]   - Fascinating to think about, by the way, yeah.
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:45.460]   - But on the moon, this doesn't happen.
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:46.800]   The only thing that happens on the moon
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.780]   is you have objects impacting the moon
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:53.540]   and they go 10 meters deep, so they produce some dust.
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.020]   But the moon keeps everything.
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:57.260]   It's like a museum, it keeps everything on the surface.
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:01.540]   So if we go to the moon, I would highly recommend
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:04.780]   regarding it as an archeological site
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:07.580]   and looking for objects that are strange.
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:11.380]   Maybe it collected some trash from interstellar space.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:13.900]   - If we could just linger on the Drake equation
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:16.340]   for a little bit, we kind of talked about
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:18.860]   there's a lot of uncertainty in the parameters,
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:23.300]   and the Drake equation itself is very limited,
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:27.300]   but I think the parameters are interesting in themselves,
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.820]   even if it's limited, because I think each one
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:32.060]   is within the reach of science, right,
[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.260]   to get the evidence for.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:36.540]   A few I find really interesting,
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:40.100]   could be interesting to get your comment on.
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.580]   So the one with the most variance,
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:44.540]   I would say, from my perspective,
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:47.580]   is the length that civilizations last,
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:48.420]   however you define it.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.420]   In the Drake equation, it's the length
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:52.020]   of how long you're communicating.
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:53.060]   - Yeah, transmitting.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:54.980]   - Transmitting, just like you said,
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:57.780]   that's a wrong way to think about it,
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:00.140]   because we could be detecting some other outputs
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.660]   of the civilizations, et cetera.
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:03.780]   But if we just define broadly
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:06.140]   how long those civilizations last,
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:10.260]   do you have a sense of how long that might last?
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:12.980]   Like what are the great filters
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:14.740]   that might destroy civilizations
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:16.380]   that we should be thinking about?
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:21.900]   How can science give us more hints on this topic?
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:24.140]   - So I, as I mentioned before,
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.460]   operate by the Copernican principle,
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:28.860]   meaning that we are not special.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:31.340]   We don't live in a special place,
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:33.440]   and not in a special time.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.340]   And by the way, it's just modesty
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:39.220]   encapsulated in scientific terms, right?
[01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:41.020]   You're saying, I'm not special,
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:44.260]   I find conditions here, they exist everywhere.
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.720]   So if you adopt the Copernican principle,
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:50.860]   you basically say, our civilization
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:55.080]   transmitted radio signals for 100 years, roughly.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:59.020]   So probably it would last another 100 or a few hundred,
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.620]   and that's it.
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:02.620]   Because we don't live at a special time.
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:06.260]   So that's, you know, well, of course,
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:09.020]   if we get our act together,
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:11.400]   and we somehow start to cooperate,
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.540]   rather than fighting each other,
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:17.620]   killing each other, wasting a lot of resources
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.920]   on things that would destroy our planet,
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.040]   maybe we can lengthen that period, if we get smarter.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.360]   But the most natural assumption is to say
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.120]   that we will live into the future
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.440]   as much as we lived from the time
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.040]   that we start to develop the means for our own destruction,
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.400]   the technologies we have.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.760]   Which is quite pessimistic, I must say.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.400]   So several centuries, that's what I would give,
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.120]   not unless we get our act,
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.840]   unless we become more intelligent
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.280]   than the newspapers report every day, okay?
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.320]   Point number one.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.400]   Second, and by the way, this is relevant, I should say,
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.160]   because there was a report about
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:00.640]   perhaps a radio signal detected from Proxima Centauri.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.760]   - What do you make of that signal?
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.520]   - Oh, I think it's some Australian guy
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.120]   with a cell phone next to the observatory
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.440]   or something like that.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.840]   Because it was the Parkes Telescope in Australia.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.800]   - Okay, I was like, why an Australian guy?
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.640]   Yeah, okay.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.200]   So it's human-created noise.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.600]   - Yeah, which is always the worry,
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.320]   because actually the same observatory,
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:22.000]   the Parkes Observatory, detected a couple of years ago
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.680]   some signal, and then they realized
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.480]   that it comes back at lunchtime.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.560]   And they said, okay, what could it be?
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.320]   And then they figured out that it must be
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.040]   the microwave oven in the observatory
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.820]   because someone was opening it before it finished,
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.920]   and it was creating this radio signal
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.800]   that they detected with a telescope every lunchtime.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:46.160]   So just a cautionary remark. - That's fascinating.
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.320]   - But the reason I think it's human-made,
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.600]   without getting to the technical details,
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.660]   is because of this very short window
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.800]   by which we were transmitting radio signals
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.720]   out of the lifetime of the Earth.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:02.660]   As I said, 100 years out of 4 1/2 billion years
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:03.800]   that the Earth existed.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.120]   So what's the chance that another civilization,
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.400]   a twin civilization of ours,
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.200]   is transmitting radio signals exactly at the time
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:14.480]   that we are looking with our radio telescopes?
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.320]   - Yeah.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.000]   - 10 to the minus seven.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.160]   You know, so, and the other argument I have
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.680]   that is that they detected it
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:25.960]   in a very narrow band of frequencies,
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.240]   and that makes it, you know,
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.600]   it cannot be through natural processes,
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.920]   a very narrow band,
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:35.680]   just like some radio transmissions that we produce.
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:40.720]   But if it were to come from the habitable zone,
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:43.560]   from a transmitter on the surface of Proxima b,
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.000]   this is the planet that orbits Proxima Centauri,
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.720]   then I calculated that the frequency would drift
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.760]   through the Doppler effect.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:55.820]   You know, just like when you hear a siren on the street,
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:58.080]   you know, when the car approaches you,
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.400]   it has a different pitch than when it goes,
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:03.080]   recedes away from you, that's the Doppler effect.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.200]   And when the planet orbits the star, Proxima Centauri,
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.180]   you would see or detect a different frequency
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:12.760]   when the planet approaches us
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.040]   as compared to when it recedes.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.720]   So there should be a frequency drift
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.280]   just because of the motion of the planet.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:24.880]   And I calculated that it must be much bigger than observed.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.280]   So it cannot just be a transmitter sitting on the planet
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.520]   and sending in our direction a radio signal,
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.960]   unless they want to cancel the Doppler effect,
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.740]   but then they need to know about us,
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:40.000]   because in a different direction, it will not be canceled.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.040]   Only in our direction, they can cancel it perfectly.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:47.400]   So there is this direction of Proxima Centauri,
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.480]   but I have a problem imagining a transmitter
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.360]   on the surface of a planet in the habitable zone,
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.180]   emitting it.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:59.640]   But my main issue is really with the likelihood,
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.800]   given what we know about ourself.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.080]   - Right, in terms of the duration of the civilization.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.720]   - The Copernican principle, yeah.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.840]   - So nevertheless, this particular signal
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.560]   is likely to be a human interference perhaps,
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.960]   but do you find Proxima be interesting,
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.640]   or the more general question is,
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.640]   do you think we humans will venture out
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:26.920]   outside our solar system
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:30.320]   and potentially colonize other habitable planets?
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.800]   - Actually, I am involved in a project
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.880]   whose goal is to develop the technology
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.920]   that would allow us to leave the solar system
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.160]   and visit the nearest stars,
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:42.240]   and that is called the Starshot.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.320]   In 2015, in May 2015,
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.240]   an entrepreneur from Silicon Valley, Uri Milner,
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.960]   came to my office at Harvard and said,
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:55.600]   would you be interested in leading a project
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.880]   that would do that in our lifetime?
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.480]   Because as we discussed before,
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:03.360]   to traverse those distances with existing rockets
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.120]   would take tens of thousands of years.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.640]   And that's too long.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.840]   For example, to get to Proxima Centauri
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.920]   with the kind of spacecrafts that we already sent,
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:19.920]   like New Horizons or Voyager 1, Voyager 2,
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:26.280]   you needed to send them when the first humans left Africa,
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.520]   so that they would arrive there now.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:31.400]   And that's a long time to wait.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:34.240]   So Uri wanted to do it within our lifetime,
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.880]   10, 20 years, meaning it has to move
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.800]   at a fraction of the speed of light.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.960]   So can we send a spacecraft that would be moving
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.240]   at the fraction of the speed of light?
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:47.000]   And I said, let me look into that for six months.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.040]   And with my students and postdocs,
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.440]   we arrived to the conclusion that the only technology
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:54.920]   that can do that is the light sail technology, where--
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.080]   - Can you explain?
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.080]   - You basically produce a very powerful laser beam on Earth,
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:06.160]   so you can collect sunlight with photovoltaic cells
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:11.280]   or whatever, and then convert it into stored energy,
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:15.600]   and then produce a very powerful laser beam
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:20.600]   that is 100 gigawatt, and focus it on a sail in space
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:26.560]   that is roughly the size of a person,
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:29.200]   a couple of meters or a few meters,
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.200]   that weighs only a gram or a few grams, very thin.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:38.560]   And through the math, you can show that you can propel
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:41.460]   such a sail, if you shine on it for a few minutes,
[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:43.680]   it will traverse a distance that is five times
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.580]   the distance to the moon, and it will get
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.480]   to a fifth of the speed of light.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:50.840]   - Sounds crazy, but I've talked to a bunch of people,
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.640]   and they're like, I know it sounds crazy,
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.080]   but it's actually, it will work.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.360]   This is one of those, it's just beautiful.
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.960]   I mean, this is science.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:04.800]   - And the point is, people didn't get excited about space
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.400]   since the Apollo era, and it's about time
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.120]   for us to go into space.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.280]   Couple of months ago, I was asked to participate
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:19.240]   in a debate organized by IBM and Bloomberg News,
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.240]   and the discussion centered on the question,
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.280]   is the space race between the US and China
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.640]   good for humanity?
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.480]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:31.160]   - And all the other debaters were worried
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.000]   about the military threats.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.080]   And I just couldn't understand what they're talking about,
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.640]   'cause military threats come from hovering
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.880]   above the surface of the Earth, right?
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:45.200]   And we live on a two-dimensional surface.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:46.600]   We live on the surface of the Earth.
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.600]   But space is all about the third dimension,
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.120]   getting far from Earth.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:54.080]   So if you go to Mars, or you go to a star, another star,
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.720]   there is no military threat.
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:56.960]   What are we talking about?
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:01.960]   Space is all about feeling that we are one civilization,
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:06.200]   in fact, not fighting each other, just going far,
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.200]   and having aspirations for something
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.240]   that goes beyond military threats.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:14.680]   So why would we be worried that the space race will lead?
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.080]   - That's actually brilliant.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:20.480]   In our discourse about it, the space race
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:23.120]   is sometimes made synonymous with the Cold War,
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:25.000]   or something like that, or with wars.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.440]   But really, yeah, there was a lot of ego tied up in that.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.920]   I remember, I mean, it's still, to this day,
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.000]   there's a lot of pride that Russians,
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.680]   the Soviet Union was the first to space,
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.360]   and there's a lot of pride on the American side
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.160]   that it was the first on the moon.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.880]   But yeah, you're exactly right.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.320]   There's no aggression, there's no wars.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:45.280]   - And beyond that, if you think about the global economy
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:47.920]   right now, there is a commercial interest.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.080]   That's why Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.840]   are interested about Mars and so forth.
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.000]   There is a commercial interest which is international.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.280]   It's driven by money, not by pride.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:02.360]   And nations can sign treaties.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.200]   First of all, there are lots of treaties that were signed
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.760]   even before the First World War and the Second World War,
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.920]   and the World War took place.
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:11.200]   So who cares?
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:15.440]   Humans, treaties do not safeguard anything.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.040]   But beyond that, even if nations sign treaties
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:21.600]   about space exploration, you might still find
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.280]   commercial entities that will find a way
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:25.760]   to get their launches.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.680]   And so I think we should rethink space.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:32.040]   It has nothing to do with national pride.
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.760]   Once again, nothing to do with our egos.
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:36.320]   It's about exploration.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:40.400]   And the biggest problem I think in human history
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:45.120]   is that humans tend to think about egos
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:50.120]   and about their own personal image
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.720]   rather than look at the big picture.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.680]   We will not be around for long.
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.320]   We are just occupying a small space right now.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.920]   Let's move out of this.
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.880]   The way that Oscar Wilde said, I think is the best.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.720]   He said, "All of us are in the gutters,
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:11.640]   "but some of us are looking at the stars."
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:14.240]   - Yeah, and the more of us are looking at the stars,
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:19.240]   the likelier we are to, for this little experiment
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:22.440]   we have going on to last a while
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.480]   as opposed to end too quickly.
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:27.200]   I mean, it's not just about science of being humble.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:30.000]   It's about the survival of the human species
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.460]   is being humble.
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:34.240]   To me, it's incredibly inspiring,
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.840]   the Starshot Project of, I mean,
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.320]   there's something magical about being able to go
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:43.240]   to another habitable planet and take a picture even.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:46.000]   I mean, within our lifetime, I mean,
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.600]   that with crazy technology too,
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.240]   which is, it's exciting.
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:51.440]   - I should tell you how it was conceived.
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:56.440]   So I was at the time, so after six months passed,
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.240]   after the visit of Yuri Miller,
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:03.040]   I was, usually I go in December during the winter break,
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.920]   I go to Israel.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:09.000]   I used to go to see my family and I get a phone call
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.840]   just before the weekend started.
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.940]   They get a phone call,
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.480]   Yuri would like you to present your concept
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:19.560]   in two weeks at his home.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.360]   And I said, well, thank you for letting me know
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:25.400]   because I'm actually out of the door of the hotel
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:29.120]   to go to a goat farm in the Negev,
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.600]   in the Southern part of Israel,
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.640]   because my wife wanted to have sort of,
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:37.520]   to go to a place that is removed from civilization,
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.160]   so to speak.
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.320]   So we went to that goat farm
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.080]   and I need to make the presentation.
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:48.160]   And there was no internet connectivity
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.280]   except in the office of the goat farm.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:53.320]   So the following morning at 6 a.m.,
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:56.640]   I sit with my back to the office of that goat farm,
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.960]   looking at goats that were newly born
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.200]   and typing into my laptop the presentation,
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.360]   the PowerPoint presentation about our ambitions
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.760]   for visiting the nearest star.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.320]   And that was very surreal to me that,
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:12.800]   you know, look.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.720]   (laughing)
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.760]   - Like our origins in many ways,
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:18.400]   this very primitive origins
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.960]   and our dreams of looking out there.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:22.840]   It's brilliant.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.160]   So that is incredibly inspiring to me,
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.160]   but it's also inspiring of putting humans
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.220]   onto other moons or planets.
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:37.320]   I still find going to the moon really exciting.
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:39.000]   I don't know, maybe I'm just a sucker for it,
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.080]   but it's really exciting.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.800]   And Mars, which is a new place, a new planet,
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:46.400]   another planet that might have life.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.080]   I mean, there's something magical to that
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.960]   or some traces of previous life.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:52.880]   - You might think that humans cannot really survive
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:55.120]   and there are risks by going there.
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:00.000]   But my point is, you know, we started from Africa
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.440]   and we got to apartment buildings in Manhattan, right?
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.880]   It's a very different environment
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.800]   from the jungles to live in an apartment building
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.460]   in, you know, a small cubicle.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.560]   And, you know, it took tens of thousands of years,
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:16.000]   but humans adapted, right?
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.920]   So why couldn't humans also make the leap
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.760]   and adapt to a habitat in space?
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:21.680]   You know that?
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.560]   Now you can build a platform
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:25.920]   that would look like an apartment building
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.480]   in the Bronx or somewhere,
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:32.440]   but have inside of it everything that humans need.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.280]   And just like the space station, but bigger,
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:37.360]   and it will be a platform in space.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.280]   And the advantage of that
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:42.220]   is if something bad happens on Earth,
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:45.400]   you have that complex where humans live
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.760]   and you can also move it back and forth
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.260]   depending on how bright the sun gets.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:53.040]   Because, you know, within a billion years,
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:57.160]   within a billion years, the sun would be too hot
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.960]   and it will boil off all the oceans on Earth.
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.200]   So we cannot stay here for more than a billion years.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.040]   That's for sure.
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:03.960]   - Yes.
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.320]   So that's a billion years from now.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.840]   I prefer like shorter term deadlines.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.760]   And so, and that's, I mean,
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.760]   there's a lot of threats that we're facing currently.
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.560]   Do you find it exciting, the possibility of,
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.920]   you know, landing on Mars and starting little like
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:24.040]   building a Manhattan style apartment building on Mars
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.120]   and humans occupying it?
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.320]   Do you think from a scientific
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:31.380]   or an engineering perspective, that's a worthy pursuit?
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:33.880]   - I think it's worthy, but the real issue
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.660]   that is often underplayed is the risk
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:41.400]   to the human body from cosmic rays.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.600]   These are energetic particles
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:46.280]   and we are protected from them
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:50.760]   by the magnetic field around the Earth that blocks them.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.680]   But if you go to Mars,
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.760]   where there is no such magnetic field to block them,
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:59.000]   then, you know, a significant fraction of the brain cells
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.040]   in your head will be damaged within a year.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:05.280]   And the consequences of that are not clear.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.940]   I mean, it's quite possible
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:12.740]   that humans cannot really survive on the surface.
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:15.840]   Now it may mean that we need to dig tunnels,
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:18.660]   go underground or create some protection.
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:21.660]   This is something that can be engineered.
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:22.540]   - Yes.
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:24.220]   - And, you know, we can start from the moon
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:25.680]   and then move to Mars.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.540]   That would be a natural progression.
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:31.180]   But it's a big issue that needs to be dealt with.
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:34.160]   I don't think, you know, it's a showstopper.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.700]   I think we can overcome it.
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:38.860]   But, you know, just like anything in science and technology,
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:42.500]   you have to work on it for a while, figure out solutions.
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:45.500]   But it's not as rosy as Elon Musk talks about.
[01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:49.100]   I mean, Elon Musk can obviously be optimistic.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.700]   I think eventually it will boil down to figuring out
[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:55.140]   how to cope with this risk, the health risk.
[01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:57.580]   - Yeah, I mean, in defense of optimism,
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:01.220]   I find that there's at least a correlation,
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:02.620]   if not their best friends,
[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.600]   is optimism and open-mindedness.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:14.180]   It's a necessary, it's a precondition to try crazy things.
[01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:19.060]   And in that sense, the sense I have about going to Mars,
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:24.060]   if we use today's logic of what kind of benefits
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:27.460]   we'll get from that, we're never going to go.
[01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:31.600]   Like most decisions we make in life,
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.420]   most decisions we've made as a human species,
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:39.220]   are irrational if you look at just today.
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:41.540]   But if you look at the long arc
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:44.080]   and the possibilities that it might bring,
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.180]   just like humans--
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:47.500]   - Left Europe and went--
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.340]   - Yeah, Europe and--
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:50.180]   - And by the way, it was for--
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:51.300]   - And destroyed everybody on the--
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:54.420]   - But it was a commercial interest that drove that
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:56.700]   for trade.
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:59.020]   And, you know, it might happen again in this context.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.380]   You have people like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:03.780]   that are commercially driven to go to space.
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:07.980]   But it doesn't mean that what we will ultimately find
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:11.020]   is not new worlds that have nothing,
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:15.380]   have much more to offer than just commercial interests.
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:17.900]   - As a side effect almost, right?
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:21.060]   - Yeah, yeah, and that's why I think
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:23.100]   we should be open-minded and explore.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.460]   However, at the same time,
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:28.060]   because of the reasons you pointed out,
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:30.020]   I'm not optimistic that we will survive
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:32.220]   more than a few centuries into the future.
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:34.460]   Because people do not think long-term,
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:38.140]   and that means that we will only survive for the short term.
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:40.240]   - I don't know if you have thoughts about this,
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:43.320]   but what are the things that worry you the most about,
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.100]   from the great perspective of the universe,
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:47.500]   which is the great filters
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:50.060]   that destroys intelligent civilizations,
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.080]   but for our own species here,
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:55.580]   like what are the things that worry you the most?
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:57.420]   - Yeah, the thing that worries me the most
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:58.780]   is that people pay attention
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:00.780]   to how many likes they have on Twitter.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:05.180]   And rather than, you know,
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:08.460]   basketball coaches tell the team players,
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:12.900]   keep your eyes on the ball, not on the audience.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.460]   The problem is we keep our eyes on the audience
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:16.380]   most of the time.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.660]   Let's keep our eyes on the ball.
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:19.740]   And what does that mean?
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.780]   First of all, in context of science,
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:24.080]   it means pay attention to the evidence.
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.440]   When the evidence looks strange,
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:29.380]   then we should figure it out.
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:33.980]   You know, I went to a seminar about Umuamua at Harvard,
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:38.980]   and a colleague of mine that is mainstream, conservative,
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:43.540]   would never say anything that would deviate
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:46.500]   from what everyone else is thinking.
[01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:48.700]   Said to me after the seminar,
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:51.740]   "I wish this object never existed."
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:55.300]   Now, to me, I mean, I just couldn't hear that.
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:56.140]   What do you mean?
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:59.700]   Nature is whatever it is, you have to pay attention to it.
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:03.340]   You cannot say, you know, you cannot bury your head in this.
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:06.180]   I mean, you should bless nature for giving you clues
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:08.300]   about things that you haven't expected.
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:10.620]   And I think that's the biggest fault,
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:13.660]   that we are looking for confirmations
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:15.460]   of things we already know,
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:20.460]   so that we can maintain our pride that we already knew it,
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:23.580]   and maintain our image, not make mistakes,
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:24.860]   because we already knew it,
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:27.300]   therefore we expected the right thing.
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:29.900]   But science is a learning experience,
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:31.420]   and sometimes you're wrong.
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:33.300]   And let's learn from those mistakes.
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:34.820]   And what's the problem about that?
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:38.340]   Why do we have to get prizes,
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:42.140]   and why do we get to be honored and maintain our image,
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:43.860]   when the actual objective of science
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:45.460]   is learning about nature?
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.620]   - And like you've talked about,
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:50.060]   anomalies in this case are actually,
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:53.460]   are not things that are unfortunate and to be ignored,
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:56.620]   are in fact gifts, and should be the focus of science.
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:58.420]   - Exactly, because that's the way for us
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:00.020]   to improve our understanding.
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:03.340]   If you look at quantum mechanics, nobody dreamed about it,
[01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:05.500]   and it was revolutionary,
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.340]   and we still don't fully understand it.
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:09.260]   It's a pain for us to figure out.
[01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:12.420]   - So why do you, so I understand from the perspective
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:14.240]   that's holding our science back,
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.980]   well, why do you have a sense that that's also something
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:21.120]   that might be a problem for us,
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.800]   in terms of the survival of human civilization?
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.680]   - Because when you look at society,
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:28.380]   it operates by the same principles.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:34.500]   There is, people look for affirmation by groups,
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:39.380]   and they, you know, people segregate into herds
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:41.380]   that think like them, especially these days,
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.220]   when social media is so strong,
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:45.140]   you can find your support group.
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:48.940]   And if you don't look for evidence for what you're saying,
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.180]   you can say crazy things,
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:53.500]   as long as there are enough people supporting what you say,
[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.700]   you can even have your newspapers,
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:58.500]   you can have everything to support your view,
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:01.380]   and then bad things will happen to society.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:03.820]   - Because we're detaching ourselves from reality,
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:06.380]   and if we detach ourselves from reality,
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.980]   all the destructive things that naturally can occur
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:11.460]   in the real world, whether from nuclear weapons,
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:13.760]   all the kinds of threats that we're facing,
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:16.100]   even we're living through a pandemic,
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:19.980]   the supposed, you know, a much, much worse pandemic
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:23.300]   could happen, and then we could, sadly,
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.740]   like we did this one, politicize it in some kind of way
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:29.580]   and have bickering in the space of Twitter and politics,
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:31.660]   as opposed to there's an actual thing
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:32.900]   that could destroy the human species.
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:35.220]   - Exactly, so the only way for us to maintain,
[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:39.060]   to stay modest and learn about what really happens
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:40.740]   is by looking for evidence.
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:45.580]   Again, I'm saying, it's not about ourself, you know?
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.820]   It's about figuring out what's around us,
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:50.500]   and if you close yourself by surrounding yourself
[01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:53.140]   with people that are like-minded,
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.860]   that refuse to look at the evidence,
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:59.860]   you can do bad things, and throughout human history,
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:03.620]   that's the origin of all the bad things that happen.
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:04.460]   - Yes.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:05.740]   - And I think it's a key.
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:08.580]   It's a key to be modest and to look at evidence,
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:10.120]   and it's not a nuance.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:15.020]   Now, you might say, oh, okay, the uneducated person
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:17.700]   might operate, no, it's the scientific community
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:18.700]   operates this way.
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:22.540]   My problem is not with people that don't have
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:25.900]   an academic pedigree, it's include everywhere in society.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:30.420]   - On the topic of the discovery of evidence
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:32.120]   of alien civilizations, which is something
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:36.020]   you touch on in your book, what that idea
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:40.220]   would do to societies, to the human psyche,
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:42.020]   and in general, do you think,
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:47.500]   and you talk about the, I still have trouble pronouncing,
[01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:48.860]   but-- - Oumuamua.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:51.060]   - Oumuamua wager, right?
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:54.580]   What do you think is, can you explain it,
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:56.780]   and what do you think in general is the effect
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:59.860]   that such knowledge might have on human civilization?
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:03.580]   - Right, so Pascal had this wager about God,
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:05.500]   and by the way, there are interesting connections
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:08.940]   between theology and the search for extraterrestrial life.
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:10.740]   You know, it's possible that, you know,
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:14.820]   we were planted on this planet by another civilization.
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:16.900]   - Yes. - You know, we attribute
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:19.420]   to God powers that belong really
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:21.780]   to the technological civilization.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:25.900]   But putting that aside, Pascal basically said,
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:28.000]   you know, let's, there are two possibilities,
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.540]   either God exists or not, right?
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:34.720]   And if God exists, you know, the consequences
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:38.220]   are quite significant, and therefore, you know,
[01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:42.340]   we should consider that possibility differently
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:45.140]   than equal weight to both possibilities.
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:50.140]   And I suggest that we do the same with Oumuamua
[01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:53.460]   or other technological signatures,
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:58.380]   that we keep in mind the consequences,
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:01.220]   and therefore, pay more attention to that possibility.
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:05.160]   Now, some people say extraordinary claims
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.420]   require extraordinary evidence.
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:10.220]   My point is that the term extraordinary
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:12.940]   is really subjective, you know.
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:16.360]   For one person, a black hole is extraordinary.
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.980]   For another, you know, it's just a consequence
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:20.980]   of Einstein's theory of gravity.
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:22.620]   Yeah, it's nothing extraordinary.
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:26.660]   The same about the type of dark matter, anything.
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:31.320]   So we should leave the extraordinary part of that sentence.
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.920]   Just keep evidence, okay?
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:36.260]   So let's be guided by evidence,
[01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:39.220]   and even if we have extraordinary claims,
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:41.220]   you know, let's not dismiss them
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:43.660]   because the evidence is not extraordinary enough,
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:46.340]   because if we have an image of something
[01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:48.260]   and it looks really strange, and we say,
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:50.800]   oh, the image is not sufficiently sharp,
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:53.100]   therefore, we should not even pay attention to this image
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:56.180]   or not even consider, I think that's a mistake.
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:57.980]   What we should do is say, look,
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:00.480]   there is some evidence for something unusual.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.420]   Let's try and build instruments
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:04.780]   that will give us a better image.
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:07.940]   And if you just dismiss extraordinary claims
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:10.860]   because you consider them extraordinary,
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:14.340]   you avoid discovering things that you haven't expected.
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:19.340]   And so I believe that along the history of astronomy,
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:21.100]   there are many missed opportunities.
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:22.340]   And I speak about astronomy,
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:24.260]   but I'm sure in other fields, it's also true.
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:26.740]   I mean, this is my expertise.
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:28.900]   For example, you know, the Astrophysical Journal,
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:32.980]   which is the main primary publication in astrophysics,
[01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:36.860]   if you go before the 1980s,
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:40.100]   there are images that were posted in the Astrophysical Journal
[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:43.860]   of giant arcs, you know, arcs of light
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:46.940]   surrounding clusters of galaxies.
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:50.800]   And you know, you can find it in printed versions
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:51.720]   of the Astrophysical Journal.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:55.060]   People just ignore, they put the image, they see the arc,
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:58.620]   they say, oh, who knows what it is, and just ignore it.
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.780]   And then in the 1980s,
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:04.540]   the subject of gravitational lensing became popular.
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:09.200]   And the idea is that you can deflect light
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:11.060]   by the force of gravity.
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:13.980]   And then you can put the source
[01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:15.600]   behind the cluster of galaxies,
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.220]   and then you will get these arcs.
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:20.660]   And actually Einstein predicted it in 1940.
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:24.620]   And you know, so these things were expected,
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:27.080]   but people just had them in the images,
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:27.980]   didn't pay attention.
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:30.340]   So I'm sure there are lost opportunities sometimes.
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:31.860]   Even in existing data,
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:35.760]   you have things that are unusual and exceptional,
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:38.380]   and are not being addressed.
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:41.540]   - Yeah, you actually, I think you have an article,
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:44.540]   the data's not enough from quite a few years ago,
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:48.420]   where you talk, you know, we can go back to the '70s and '80s
[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:50.860]   but we can go also to the Mayan civilization.
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:52.220]   - Right, the Mayan civilization
[01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:53.780]   basically believed in astrology
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:56.980]   that you can forecast the outcome of a war
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:59.380]   based on the position of the planets.
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:03.660]   And they had, you know, astronomers in their culture
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:06.660]   had the highest social status.
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:09.380]   They were priests, they were elevated.
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:11.860]   And the reason was that they helped politicians
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:13.940]   decide when to go to war,
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:16.460]   because they would tell the politicians, you know,
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:18.380]   the planets would be in this configuration,
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:21.900]   it's a better chance for you to win the war, go to war.
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:26.460]   And in retrospect, they collected wonderful data,
[01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:28.220]   but misinterpreted it.
[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.940]   Because we now know that the position of Venus,
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:34.300]   or Jupiter, or whatever, has nothing to do
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:36.580]   with the outcome of World War I, World War II,
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:38.380]   you know, it has nothing to do.
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:42.980]   And so we can have a prejudice and collect data
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:46.380]   without actually doing the right thing with it.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:48.100]   - That's such a Pisces thing to say,
[01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.500]   I looked up what your astrological sign is, so.
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:53.780]   (both laughing)
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:55.980]   Well, so you mentioned Einstein predicted
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:57.580]   that black holes don't exist,
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:49:59.140]   or just didn't, or--
[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:00.300]   - Don't exist in nature.
[01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:01.620]   - Don't exist in nature.
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:03.740]   - When Einstein came up with his theory of gravity
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:08.220]   in 1915, November 1915, a few months later,
[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:11.100]   another physicist, Karl Schwarzschild,
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:13.820]   he was the director of the Potsdam Observatory,
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:16.060]   but he was a patriot, a German patriot.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:18.980]   So he went into the First World War fighting for Germany.
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:21.620]   But while he was at the front,
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:23.580]   he sent a postcard to Einstein saying,
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:25.740]   you know, a few months after the theory was developed,
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:29.140]   saying, actually, I found a solution to your equations.
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:30.860]   And that was a black hole solution.
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:33.700]   And then he died a few months later.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.940]   And Einstein was a pacifist, and he survived.
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:38.940]   So the lesson from this story is that
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:42.340]   if you want to work out the consequences of a theory,
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:43.860]   you better be a pacifist.
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:45.540]   (both laughing)
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:48.780]   But the point is that this solution was known
[01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:51.380]   shortly after Einstein came up with his theory.
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:56.020]   But in 1939, Einstein wrote a paper
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:58.380]   in the "Analysis of Mathematics" saying,
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:00.140]   even though the solution exists,
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:02.500]   I don't think it's realized in nature.
[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:06.100]   And his argument was, if you imagine a star collapsing,
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:10.140]   stars often spin, and the spin will prevent them
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:12.900]   from making a black hole, collapsing to a point.
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:14.940]   - So, I mean, can you maybe,
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:19.220]   one of the many things you have work on,
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:22.060]   you're an expert in, is black holes.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:24.160]   Can you first say what are black holes?
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:27.780]   And second, how do we know that they exist?
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:30.620]   - Right, so black holes are the ultimate prison.
[01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:33.260]   You know, you can check in, but you can never check out.
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:34.460]   - You're such a romantic.
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:35.620]   (both laughing)
[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:38.300]   - Even light cannot escape from them.
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:41.180]   So there are extreme structures of space and time.
[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:46.660]   And there is this so-called Schwarzschild radius,
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:49.580]   or the event horizon of a black hole.
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:52.620]   Once you enter into it with a spaceship,
[01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:55.620]   you would never be able to tweet back to your friends
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:58.780]   and tell them, by the way, I asked the students in my class,
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:01.340]   freshman seminar at Harvard, I said,
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:05.020]   "Let me give you two possible journeys that you can take."
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:08.380]   I said, "Suppose aliens come to Earth
[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:12.420]   "and suggest that you would board their spaceship.
[01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:13.500]   "Would you do it?"
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:17.460]   And the second is, suppose you could board a spaceship
[01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:20.140]   that will take you into a black hole, would you do it?
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:24.300]   So all of them said to the first question,
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:26.380]   "Yes, under one condition,
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:29.900]   "that I'll be able to maintain my social media contacts
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:33.220]   "and report back, share the experience with them."
[01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:36.460]   I couldn't, personally, I have no footprint on social media.
[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:39.100]   - Yeah, which is as a matter of principle.
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:42.180]   - Yeah, my wife asked me when we got married,
[01:52:42.180 --> 01:52:44.780]   and I honor that.
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:45.820]   - And I told you offline,
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:48.300]   I need to get married to such a woman.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:49.500]   She truly is a special agent.
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:52.780]   - Well, she was wise enough to recognize the risk,
[01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:55.220]   but it saves me time,
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:57.740]   and it also keeps me away from crowds.
[01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:02.740]   I don't have the notion of what a lot of other people think,
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:03.860]   so I can think independently.
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:04.860]   - So crowd think, exactly.
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:05.700]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:10.500]   So I was surprised to hear that for students,
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.740]   it's extremely important to share experiences.
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:14.900]   Even if they go on a spaceship with aliens,
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:17.420]   they still want to brag about it,
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:19.820]   rather than look around and see what's going on.
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:21.860]   - This is not an option when you go to the black hole,
[01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:22.980]   is exactly the point.
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:24.980]   - So for the black hole, they said no,
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:27.780]   because obviously you can find your death
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:30.220]   after you get into it,
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:32.780]   and you crash into singularity.
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:34.260]   There is this singularity in the center.
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:36.900]   So inside the event horizon,
[01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:41.420]   we know that all the matter collects at a point.
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:45.700]   Now, we can't really predict what happens at the singularity
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:48.460]   because Einstein's theory breaks down,
[01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:49.780]   and we know why it breaks down,
[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:51.820]   because he doesn't have quantum mechanics
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:54.260]   that talks about small distances.
[01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:57.340]   We don't have a theory that unifies quantum mechanics
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:54:01.780]   and gravity so that it will predict what happens
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:03.380]   in near a singularity.
[01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:06.180]   And in fact, a couple of years ago,
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:09.140]   I had a flood in my basement.
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:15.100]   And I invited a plumber to come over and figure out,
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:19.420]   and we found that the sewer was clogged
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:23.020]   because of tree roots that got into it.
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:24.740]   And we solved the problem.
[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:28.260]   But then I thought to myself,
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:30.020]   well, isn't that what happens
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:31.460]   at the singularity of a black hole?
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:35.420]   Because the question is, where does the matter go?
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:38.900]   If, in the case of a home, I never thought about it,
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:41.260]   but the water, all the water that we use
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:45.660]   goes in through the sewer to some reservoir somewhere.
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:48.580]   And the question is, what happens inside a black hole?
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:51.420]   And one possibility is that there is an object
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.060]   in the middle, just like a star,
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:54.580]   and everything collects there.
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:56.840]   And the object has the maximum density
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:59.460]   that we can imagine, like Planck densities.
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:01.860]   It's the ultimate density that you can have,
[01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:06.440]   where gravity is as strong as all the other forces.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:09.920]   So you can imagine this object,
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:11.580]   very dense object at the center
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:13.300]   that collects all the matter.
[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:15.900]   Another possibility is that there is some tunnel,
[01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:19.900]   just like the sewer, it takes the matter into another place.
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:21.780]   And we don't know the answer,
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:24.460]   but I wrote a Scientific American essay about it,
[01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:26.940]   admitting our ignorance.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:28.100]   So it's a fascinating question.
[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:30.500]   What happens to the matter that goes into a black hole?
[01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:32.620]   I actually recommended to some of my colleagues
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:34.100]   that work on string theory,
[01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:36.580]   at the closing of a conference,
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:39.380]   I'm the founding director of the Black Hole Initiative
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:41.740]   at Harvard, which brings together astronomers,
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:44.460]   physicists, philosophers, and mathematicians.
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:46.940]   And we have a conference once a year.
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:48.660]   And at the end of one of them,
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.740]   since I'm the director, I had to summarize,
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:55.740]   and I said that I wish we could go on a field trip
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:57.900]   to a black hole nearby.
[01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:00.660]   And I highly recommend to my colleagues
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:03.780]   that work on string theory to enter into that black hole,
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:05.780]   because then they can test their theory
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:07.400]   when they get inside.
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:10.460]   But one of the string theorists in the audience,
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:14.060]   Nimar Kani Hamid, immediately raised his voice and said,
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:15.820]   "You have an ulterior motive
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:17.700]   "for sending us into a black hole."
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:19.140]   (Lex laughing)
[01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:21.540]   Which I didn't deny, but at any event.
[01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:23.780]   (Lex laughing)
[01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:26.160]   - Yeah, that's true, that's true.
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:31.160]   Can you say why we know that black holes exist?
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:36.440]   - Right, so it's an interesting question,
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:39.860]   because black holes were considered a theoretical construct.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:44.920]   And Einstein even denied their existence in 1939.
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:49.920]   But then in the mid 1960s, quasars were discovered.
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:55.820]   These are very bright sources of light,
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:59.940]   100 times brighter than their host galaxy,
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:03.580]   which are point-like at the center of galaxies.
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:08.580]   And it was immediately suggested by Ed Salpeter in the West,
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:13.140]   and by Yakov Zeldovich in the East,
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:18.340]   that these are black holes that accrete gas,
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:20.420]   collect gas from their host galaxy
[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:22.280]   that are being fed with gas.
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:23.700]   And they shine very brightly,
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:28.540]   because as the gas falls towards the black holes,
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:32.600]   just like water running down the sink,
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:39.260]   the gas swirls and then rubs against itself,
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:42.660]   and heats up and shines very brightly,
[01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:45.340]   because it's very hot close to the black hole,
[01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:49.700]   by viscosity, it heats up.
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:52.440]   And in the case of black holes, it's the turbulence,
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:55.720]   the turbulent viscosity that causes it to heat up.
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:58.920]   So we get these very bright sources of light
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:02.000]   just from black holes that are supposed to be dark.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.120]   Nothing escapes from them,
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:06.960]   but they create a violent environment
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:09.540]   where gas moves close to the speed of light,
[01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:11.400]   and therefore shines very brightly,
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.840]   much more than any other source in the sky.
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.840]   And we can see these quasars
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:17.720]   all the way to the edge of the universe.
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:21.180]   So we have evidence now that when the universe was
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:25.940]   about 7% of its present age, infant,
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:28.180]   already back then you had black holes
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:31.060]   of a billion times the mass of the sun,
[01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:32.620]   which is quite remarkable.
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:36.860]   It's like finding giant babies in a nursery.
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:40.620]   How can these black holes grow so fast?
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:42.980]   Less than a billion years after the Big Bang,
[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:45.740]   you already have a billion times the mass of the sun
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:46.780]   in these black holes.
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:51.780]   And the answer is presumably there are very quick processes
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:54.160]   that build them up.
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.100]   - They build quickly.
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:57.120]   - Very quickly.
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:59.880]   And so we see those black holes,
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:01.960]   and that was found in the mid 1960s,
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:05.920]   but in 19, sorry, in 2015,
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:09.200]   exactly 100 years after Einstein came up
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:11.880]   with his theory of gravity,
[01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:15.920]   the LIGO observatory detected gravitational waves.
[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:18.500]   And these are just ripples in space and time.
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:20.060]   So according to Einstein's theory,
[01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:24.340]   the ingenuity of Einstein's theory of gravity
[01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:27.980]   that was formulated in November, 1915,
[01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:32.020]   was to say that space and time are not rigid.
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:36.820]   They respond to matter.
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:40.200]   So for example, if you have two black holes
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:45.100]   and they collide, it's just like a stone being thrown
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:47.340]   on the surface of a pond.
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:51.820]   They generate waves, disturbances in space and time
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:53.780]   that propagate out at the speed of light.
[01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:55.460]   These are gravitational waves.
[01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:58.380]   They create a space-time storm around them,
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:02.260]   and then the waves go all the way through the universe
[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:03.220]   and reach us.
[02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:07.140]   And if you have a sensitive enough detector like LIGO,
[02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:08.380]   you can detect these waves.
[02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:12.000]   And so it was not just the message that we received
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.060]   for the first time, gravitational waves,
[02:00:14.060 --> 02:00:16.100]   but it was the messenger.
[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:17.500]   So there are two aspects to it.
[02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:19.500]   One is the messenger, which is gravitational wave
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:21.900]   for the first time were detected directly.
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:23.300]   And the second was the message,
[02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:26.160]   which was a collision of two black holes,
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:27.900]   because we could see the pattern
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:30.180]   of the ripples in space and time.
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:33.700]   And it was fully consistent with the prediction
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:37.180]   that Schwarzschild made for how the space-time
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:38.140]   around the black hole is,
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:40.420]   because when two black holes collide,
[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:43.960]   you can sort of map from the message that you get,
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:46.820]   you can reconstruct what really happened,
[02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:48.420]   and it's fully consistent.
[02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:53.420]   - And in 2017 and 2020, there's two Nobel Prizes.
[02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:55.740]   - That's right.
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:59.860]   - That had to do with the black holes.
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:03.220]   Can you maybe describe in the same masterful way
[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:05.140]   that you already been doing,
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:06.900]   what those Nobel Prizes were given for?
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:10.640]   - Yeah, so the 2017 was given for the LIGO collaboration
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:13.060]   for discovering gravitational waves
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:14.840]   from collisions of black holes.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:20.540]   And the 2020 Nobel Prize in physics
[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:23.480]   was given for two things.
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:27.960]   One was theoretical work that was done by Roger Penrose
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:31.680]   in the 1960s, demonstrating that black holes
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:35.820]   are inevitable when stars collapse.
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:38.720]   And it was mostly mathematical work.
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:43.720]   And actually Stephen Hawking also contributed significantly
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:47.660]   to that frontier, and unfortunately he is not alive,
[02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:49.440]   so he could not be honored.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.980]   So Penrose received it on his own.
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:57.740]   And then two other astronomers received it as well,
[02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:00.040]   Andrea Ghez and Reinhard Genzel,
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.620]   and they provided conclusive evidence
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:03.920]   that there is a black hole
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:05.860]   at the center of the Milky Way galaxy
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:11.280]   that weighs about four million times the mass of the sun.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:13.880]   And they found the evidence from the motion of stars
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:15.700]   very close to the black hole.
[02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:18.640]   Just like we see the planets moving around the sun,
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:21.400]   there are stars close to the center of the galaxy,
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:24.120]   and they are orbiting at very high speeds
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:26.680]   of order of thousands of kilometers per second
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:29.260]   or thousands of miles per second.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.180]   Think about it.
[02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:36.380]   Which can only be induced at those distances
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:41.380]   if there is a four million solar mass object
[02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:44.880]   that is extremely compact.
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:48.000]   And the only thing that is compatible with the constraints
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.520]   is a black hole.
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:54.520]   And they actually made a movie of the motion of these stars
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:56.200]   around the center.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.160]   One of them moves around the center over a decade,
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:02.520]   over timescales that we can monitor.
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:05.780]   And it was a breakthrough in a way.
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:11.980]   So combining LIGO with the detection of a black hole
[02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:13.220]   at the center of the Milky Way
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:16.280]   and in many other galaxies like quasars,
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:22.660]   now I would say black hole research is vogue.
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:25.380]   It's very much in fashion.
[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:27.380]   We saw it back in 2016
[02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:31.180]   when we established the Black Hole Initiative.
[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:34.040]   You kind of saw that there's this excitement
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:39.040]   about in breakthroughs and discoveries around black holes,
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.120]   which are probably one of the most fascinating objects
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.680]   in the universe.
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:44.700]   It's up there.
[02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:48.440]   They're both terrifying and beautiful,
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.640]   and they capture the entirety of the physics
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:51.680]   that we know about this universe.
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:53.600]   - I should say, the question is,
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:54.840]   where is the nearest black hole?
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:56.480]   Can we visit it?
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.220]   And I wrote a paper with my undergraduate student,
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:05.140]   Amir Siraj, suggesting that perhaps there could be,
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:08.260]   if there is one in the solar system, we can detect it.
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:10.900]   Because I don't know if you heard,
[02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:15.100]   but there is a claim that maybe there is a planet nine
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:16.320]   in the solar system,
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:19.740]   because we see some anomalies
[02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:21.420]   at the outer parts of the solar system.
[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:24.060]   So some people suggested maybe there is a planet out there
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:26.220]   that was not yet detected.
[02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:29.540]   So people searched for it, didn't find it.
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:32.120]   It weighs roughly five times the mass of the Earth.
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.620]   And we said, okay, maybe you can't find it
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:36.580]   because it's a black hole
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:38.260]   that was formed early in the universe.
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:40.820]   - Is that part, so where do you stand on that?
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:42.180]   - It could be that the dark matter
[02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:44.140]   is made of black holes of this mass.
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:46.340]   We don't know what the dark matter is made of.
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:48.140]   It could be black holes.
[02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:51.900]   So we said, but there is an experimental way to test it.
[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:53.540]   And the way to do it is because
[02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:59.220]   there is the Oort cloud of icy rocks
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:01.220]   in the outer solar system.
[02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:03.420]   And if you imagine a black hole there,
[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:06.820]   every now and then a rock will pass close enough
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:09.340]   to the black hole to be disrupted
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:12.420]   by the very strong gravity close to the black hole.
[02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:15.500]   And that would produce a flare that you can observe.
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:19.020]   And we calculated how frequently these flares should occur.
[02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:21.620]   And with LSST on the Vera Rubin Observatory,
[02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:24.700]   we found that you can actually test this hypothesis.
[02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:25.540]   - That's brilliant.
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:27.220]   - And if you don't see flares,
[02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:30.060]   then you can put limits on the existence of a black hole
[02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:31.380]   in the solar system.
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:34.060]   It would be extremely exciting if there was a black hole,
[02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:35.660]   if planet nine was a black hole,
[02:05:35.660 --> 02:05:39.340]   because we could visit it, and we can examine it.
[02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:44.100]   And it will not be a matter of an object
[02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:46.220]   that is very removed from us.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:48.460]   Another thing I should say is it's possible
[02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:50.660]   that the black hole affected life on Earth.
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:54.540]   The black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
[02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:56.540]   How?
[02:05:56.540 --> 02:05:59.580]   That black hole right now is dormant.
[02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:01.180]   It's very faint.
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:04.180]   But we know that it flares.
[02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:07.640]   When a star like the sun comes close to it,
[02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:09.460]   the star will be spaghettified,
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:13.760]   basically become a stream of gas, like a spaghetti.
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:16.300]   And then the gas would fall into the black hole,
[02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:17.700]   and there would be a flare.
[02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:21.020]   And this process happens once every 10,000 years or so.
[02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:25.340]   So we expect that these flares to occur every 10,000 years.
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:28.860]   But we also see evidence for the possibility
[02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:32.100]   that gas clouds were disrupted by the black hole,
[02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:35.140]   because the stars that are close to the black hole
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:38.400]   are residing in a single or two planes.
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:39.940]   And the only way you can get that
[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:42.260]   is if they formed out of a disk of gas,
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:44.760]   just like the planets in the solar system formed.
[02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:48.740]   So there is evidence that gas fell into the black hole
[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:51.140]   and powered possibly a flare.
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:56.140]   And these flares produce X-rays and ultraviolet radiation
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:07:01.380]   that could damage life if the Earth was close enough
[02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:03.620]   to the center of the galaxy.
[02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:07.160]   Where we are right now, it's not very risky for us.
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:11.540]   But there is a theoretical argument
[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:13.940]   that says the solar system, the sun,
[02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:16.960]   was closer to the galactic center early on,
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:19.460]   and then it migrated outwards.
[02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:24.460]   So maybe in the early stage of the solar system,
[02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:30.020]   the conditions were affected, shaped by these flares
[02:07:30.020 --> 02:07:31.740]   of the black hole at the center of the galaxy.
[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:34.020]   And that's why for the first two billion years,
[02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:36.340]   there wasn't any oxygen in the atmosphere.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.180]   Who knows?
[02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:40.780]   But it's just interesting to think that
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:45.580]   from a theoretical concept that Einstein resisted in 1939,
[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:50.060]   it may well be that black holes have influence on our life.
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:53.460]   And that it's just like discovering that some stranger
[02:07:53.460 --> 02:08:01.380]   affected your family and in a way your life.
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:05.580]   And if that happens to be the case,
[02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:07.360]   a second Nobel Prize should be given,
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:11.220]   not for just the discovery of this black hole
[02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:12.060]   at the center of the galaxy,
[02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:14.820]   but perhaps for the Nobel Prize in chemistry,
[02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:16.380]   for the effect that it had on life.
[02:08:16.380 --> 02:08:18.700]   - For the effect, for the interplay that resulted
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:23.700]   in some kind of, yeah, so yeah, the chemical effect,
[02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:25.940]   biology, I mean, all those kinds of things
[02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:29.900]   in terms of the emergence of life
[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:32.260]   and the creation of a habitable environment.
[02:08:32.260 --> 02:08:33.460]   That's so fascinating.
[02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:35.220]   And of course, like you said, dark matter,
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:36.860]   like black holes have some--
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:40.060]   - They could be the dark matter in principle, yes.
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:43.320]   We don't know what the dark matter is at the moment.
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:44.620]   - Does it make you sad?
[02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:46.340]   So you've had an interaction
[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:49.780]   and perhaps a bit of a friendship with Stephen Hawking.
[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:51.940]   Does it make you sad that he didn't win the Nobel?
[02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:56.500]   - Well, altogether, I don't assign great importance
[02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:58.100]   to prizes because--
[02:08:58.100 --> 02:08:58.940]   - As you said.
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:00.540]   - You know, Jean-Paul Sartre,
[02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:03.140]   who I admired as a teenager
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:04.740]   because I was interested in philosophy.
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:06.740]   When I grew up on a farm in Israel,
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:09.500]   I used to collect eggs every afternoon
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:13.180]   and I would drive the tractor to the hills of our village.
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:15.740]   And just think about philosophy, read philosophy books.
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:18.220]   And Jean-Paul Sartre was one of my favorite.
[02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:21.900]   And he was honored with a Nobel Prize in literature.
[02:09:21.900 --> 02:09:25.180]   He was a philosopher primarily, existentialist.
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:26.860]   And he said, "The hell with it.
[02:09:26.860 --> 02:09:31.860]   "Why should I give special attention to this committee
[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:34.760]   "of people that get their self-importance
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:37.020]   "from awarding me the prize?
[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:39.700]   "Like what's, you know,
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:41.860]   "why does that merit my attention?"
[02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:43.900]   So he gave up on the Nobel Prize.
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:46.900]   And you know, there are two benefits to that.
[02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:51.900]   One, that you're not working your entire life
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:54.100]   in the direction that would satisfy the will
[02:09:54.100 --> 02:09:54.940]   of other people.
[02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:57.140]   You know, you work independently,
[02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:59.040]   you're not after these honors.
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:03.940]   Just for the same reason that if you're not living your life
[02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:06.220]   for making a profit or money,
[02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:08.300]   you can live a more fulfilling life
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:11.020]   because you're not being swayed by the wind, you know,
[02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:12.820]   of how to make money and so forth.
[02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:17.100]   The second aspect of it is, you know,
[02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:21.980]   that very often, you know, these prizes,
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:26.820]   they distort the way we do science
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:31.380]   because instead of people willing to take risks
[02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:35.020]   and instead of having announcements
[02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:37.300]   only after a group of people converges
[02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:40.480]   with a definite result, you know,
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:44.000]   the natural progression of science
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.640]   is based on trial and error.
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:47.600]   You know, it's reporting some results
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:49.040]   and perhaps they're wrong,
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:51.800]   but then other people find perhaps better evidence
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:53.720]   and then you figure out what's going on.
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:55.640]   And that's the natural way that science is,
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:57.220]   you know, it's a learning experience.
[02:10:57.220 --> 02:10:59.960]   So if you give the public an image
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:03.280]   by which scientists are always right, you know,
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.020]   and you know, some of my colleagues say,
[02:11:05.020 --> 02:11:07.260]   "We must do that because otherwise the public
[02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:09.100]   "will never believe us that global warming
[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:10.640]   "is really taking place."
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.120]   But that's not true because the public
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:15.160]   would really believe you if you show the evidence.
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:16.960]   So the point is you should be sincere
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:19.560]   when the evidence is not absolutely clear
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:21.640]   or where there are disputes about the interpretation
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.360]   of the evidence, we should show ourselves.
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:26.400]   You know, the king is naked, okay?
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:30.240]   There is no point in pretending that the king is dressed,
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:32.240]   saying that scientists are always right.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:35.000]   Scientists are wrong frequently.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.500]   And the only way to make progress is by evidence,
[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:40.880]   giving us the support that we need
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:43.360]   to make airtight arguments.
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:46.140]   So when you say global warming is taking place,
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:48.920]   if the evidence is fully supportive,
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:51.440]   if there are no holes in the argument,
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:53.240]   then people will be convinced
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:55.280]   because you're not trying to fool them.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:56.680]   When the evidence was not complete,
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:58.600]   you also show them that the evidence is not complete.
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:11:59.680]   - Yeah, and when there's holes,
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:00.920]   you show that there's holes
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:02.480]   and here's the methodology we're using
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:03.680]   to try to close those holes.
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:06.000]   - Exactly, let's be sincere, why pretend?
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.640]   So if there were no, in a world
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:10.700]   where there were no prizes, no honors,
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:13.720]   we would act like kids, as I said before.
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:16.320]   We would really be focusing on the ball
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:17.480]   and not on the audience.
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:19.280]   - Yeah, the prizes get in the way,
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:21.960]   and that's so powerful.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:23.960]   Do you think, in some sense,
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:26.440]   the few people that have turned down the prize
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.520]   made a much more powerful statement?
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:29.640]   I don't know if you're familiar
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:33.460]   in the space of mathematics with the Fields Medal
[02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:36.920]   and Grigori Perelman who turned down the prize.
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:40.040]   So he, I've committed,
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:41.880]   one of the reasons I started this podcast
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:44.320]   is I'm going to definitely talk to Putin,
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:46.200]   I'm definitely talking to Perelman,
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:48.240]   and people keep telling me it's impossible.
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:52.360]   I love hearing that because I'll talk to both.
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:56.920]   Anyway, but do you have a sense
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:00.680]   of why he turned down the prize?
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:03.580]   And is that a powerful statement to you?
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:05.720]   - Well, what I read is that,
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:06.960]   you're talking about the mathematician, right?
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:07.800]   - The mathematician turned down the prize.
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:10.920]   - What I read is that he was disappointed
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:12.600]   by the response of the community,
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:15.440]   the mainstream community, the mathematicians,
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:19.440]   to his earlier work where they dismissed it,
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:22.320]   they didn't attend to the details
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:25.120]   and didn't treat him with proper respect
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:28.840]   because he was not considered one of them.
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:32.480]   And I think that speaks volumes
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:34.200]   about the current scientific culture,
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:38.120]   which is based on groupthink
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:41.940]   and on social interaction,
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:44.600]   rather than on the merit of the argument
[02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:46.560]   and on the evidence in the context of physics.
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:49.320]   So in mathematics, there is no empirical basis,
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:53.480]   you're exploring ideas that are logically consistent,
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:57.080]   but nevertheless, there is this groupthink.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:01.640]   And I think he was so frustrated with his past experience
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:04.360]   that he didn't even bother to publish his papers,
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:06.760]   he just posted them on the archive.
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:09.880]   And in a way, it's saying,
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:12.560]   I know what the answer is, go look at it.
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:13.720]   (both laugh)
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:17.200]   - And then again, in the long arc of history,
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:19.920]   his work on archive will be remembered
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:23.400]   and all the prizes, most of the prizes will be forgotten.
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:26.720]   This is what people don't kind of think about.
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:29.600]   When you look at Roger Penrose, for example,
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:31.300]   he's another fascinating figure.
[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:36.080]   It's possible, and forgive me if I'm showing my ignorance,
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:39.520]   but he's also did some work on consciousness.
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:40.800]   He's been one of the only people
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:42.560]   who spoke about consciousness,
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:44.000]   which for the longest time,
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:49.000]   and is still arguably outside of the realm of the sciences.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.600]   It's still seen as a taboo subject.
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:57.040]   And he was brave enough to explore it
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:58.320]   from a physics perspective,
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.480]   from just a philosophical perspective,
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:02.200]   but with the rigor,
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:04.480]   proposing different kind of hypotheses
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:07.760]   of how consciousness might be able to emerge in the brain.
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:10.260]   And it's possible that that is the thing he's remembered for
[02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:12.520]   if you look 100 years from now, right?
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:15.440]   As opposed to the work in the black holes,
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:17.600]   which fits into the kind of,
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:23.440]   fits into what the current scientific community
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:29.080]   allows to be the space of what is and isn't science.
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:30.880]   - Yeah, it's really interesting to look at people
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:32.480]   that are innovators,
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:35.800]   where in some phases of their career,
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:40.280]   their ideas fit into the social structure
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:41.160]   that is around them,
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:43.160]   but in other phases, it doesn't.
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:45.360]   And when you look at them,
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:48.080]   they just operated the same way throughout.
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:52.920]   And it says more about their environment than about them.
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:55.440]   - Well, yeah, I don't know if you know who Max Tegmark is.
[02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:56.680]   I just recently talked to him.
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:58.200]   - He's a friend of mine.
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:15:59.560]   - I just recently talked to him again.
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:03.920]   And he was a little bit more explicit about saying,
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:06.320]   being aware, which is something I also recommend,
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:09.000]   is being aware where the scientific community stands
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:13.520]   and doing enough to move along in your career.
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:16.160]   And it's the necessary evil, I suppose.
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:19.120]   If you are one of those out-of-the-box thinkers
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:21.440]   that just naturally have this childlike curiosity,
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:23.720]   which Max definitely is one of them,
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:26.480]   is sometimes you have to do some stuff that fits in.
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:28.920]   You publish and you get tenure and all those kinds of things.
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:30.600]   - But the tenure is a great privilege
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:32.600]   'cause it allows you to, in principle,
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:35.840]   explore things that are not accepted by others.
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:40.320]   And unfortunately, it's not being taken advantage of
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:41.440]   by most people,
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:45.360]   and it's a waste of a very precious resource.
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:46.960]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:49.360]   The space that you kind of touched on
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:52.240]   that's full of theories
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:55.200]   and is perhaps detached from
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:59.200]   appreciation of empirical evidence
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:00.960]   or longing for empirical evidence
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:02.560]   or grounding in empirical evidence
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:05.200]   is the theoretical physics community
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:09.760]   and the interest in unifying the laws of physics
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:11.800]   and with the theory of everything.
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:15.960]   I'm not sure from which direction
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:17.160]   to approach this question,
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:20.600]   but how far away are we from arriving
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:23.120]   at a theory of everything, do you think?
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:28.120]   And how important is it to try to arrive at it,
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:34.200]   at this kind of goal of this beautiful, simple theory
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:38.760]   that unlocks the very fundamental basis
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:40.520]   of our nature as we know it?
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.200]   And what are the kinds of approaches
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.240]   we need to take to get there?
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:52.160]   - Yeah, so in physics,
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:54.820]   the biggest challenge is to unify quantum mechanics
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:56.320]   with gravity.
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:01.000]   And I believe that once we have experimental evidence
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.980]   for how this happens in nature,
[02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:07.560]   in systems that have quantum mechanical effects,
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:09.940]   but also gravity is important,
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:14.120]   then the theory will fall into our lap, okay?
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:17.660]   But the mistake that is made by the community right now
[02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:22.660]   is to come up with the right theory from scratch.
[02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:25.840]   And Einstein gave the illusion
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:27.940]   that you can just sit in your office
[02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:30.640]   and understand nature when he came up
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:33.280]   with his general theory of relativity.
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:36.680]   But first of all, perhaps he was lucky,
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:39.480]   but it's not a rule.
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:41.680]   The rule is that you need evidence to guide you,
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:43.500]   especially when dealing with quantum mechanics,
[02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:46.680]   which is really not intuitive.
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:51.680]   And so there are two places where the two theories meet.
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:55.880]   One is black holes, and there is a puzzle there.
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:18:58.640]   It's called the information paradox.
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:01.520]   In principle, you can throw the Encyclopedia Britannica
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:02.360]   into a black hole.
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:03.580]   It's a lot of information.
[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:06.660]   And then it will be gone
[02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:10.760]   because a black hole carries only three properties
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:16.380]   or qualities, the mass, the charge, and the spin,
[02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:17.500]   according to Einstein.
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:22.340]   But then when Hawking tried to bring in quantum mechanics
[02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:25.340]   to the game, he realized that black holes
[02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:27.900]   have a temperature and they radiate.
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:30.100]   This is called Hawking radiation.
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:35.100]   It was sort of anticipated by Jacob Bekenstein before him,
[02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:40.200]   and Hawking wanted to prove Bekenstein wrong
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:41.460]   and then figure this out.
[02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:45.740]   And so what it means is black holes eventually evaporate,
[02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:48.720]   and they evaporate into radiation
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:50.520]   that doesn't carry this information,
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:52.660]   according to Hawking's calculation.
[02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:55.320]   And then the question is, according to quantum mechanics,
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:57.120]   information must be preserved.
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:02.120]   So where did the information go if a black hole is gone?
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:05.400]   And where is the information that was encoded
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:08.960]   in the Encyclopedia when it went into the black hole?
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:12.380]   And to that question, we don't have an answer yet.
[02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:14.960]   It's one of those puzzles about black holes,
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:16.540]   and it touches on the interplay
[02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:19.340]   between quantum mechanics and gravity.
[02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:22.440]   Another important question is what happened
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:24.640]   at the beginning of the universe?
[02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:26.380]   What happened before the Big Bang?
[02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:29.620]   And by the way, on that, I should say,
[02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:32.440]   there are some conjectures.
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:36.000]   In principle, if we figure it out,
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.900]   if we have a theory of quantum gravity,
[02:20:37.900 --> 02:20:41.140]   it's possible to imagine that we will figure out
[02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:44.220]   how to create a universe in the laboratory.
[02:20:44.220 --> 02:20:48.940]   By irritating the vacuum, you might create a baby universe.
[02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:52.140]   And if we do that, it will offer a solution
[02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:53.840]   to what happened before the Big Bang.
[02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:56.840]   Perhaps the Big Bang emerged from the laboratory
[02:20:56.840 --> 02:20:57.980]   of another civilization.
[02:20:57.980 --> 02:21:01.540]   So it's like baby universes are being born
[02:21:01.540 --> 02:21:05.100]   out of laboratories, and inside the baby universe,
[02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:07.580]   you have a civilization that brings to existence
[02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:09.060]   a new baby universe.
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:10.260]   Just like humans, right?
[02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:12.220]   We have babies, and they make babies.
[02:21:12.220 --> 02:21:14.500]   So in principle, that would solve the problem
[02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:17.360]   of why there was a Big Bang,
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:20.460]   and also what happened before the Big Bang.
[02:21:20.460 --> 02:21:24.540]   So we came, our umbilical cord is connected
[02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:26.540]   to a laboratory of a civilization
[02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:28.680]   that produced our universe once it figured out
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:29.680]   quantum gravity.
[02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:33.660]   - It's baby Big Bangs all the way down.
[02:21:33.660 --> 02:21:36.300]   It's just Big Bangs all the way down.
[02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:38.780]   - So if we collect data about how the universe started,
[02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:41.220]   we could potentially test theories of,
[02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:44.460]   or it can educate us about how to unify
[02:21:44.460 --> 02:21:45.660]   quantum mechanics and gravity.
[02:21:45.660 --> 02:21:48.180]   If we get any information about what happens
[02:21:48.180 --> 02:21:50.020]   near the singularity of a black hole,
[02:21:50.020 --> 02:21:55.860]   if we get a sense of, somehow we learn
[02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:57.980]   what happens at the singularity, that would educate.
[02:21:57.980 --> 02:22:01.700]   So there are places where we can search for evidence,
[02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:03.780]   but it's very challenging, I should say.
[02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:06.780]   And my point is, the string theorists,
[02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:10.060]   they decided that they know how to approach the problem,
[02:22:10.060 --> 02:22:13.980]   but they don't have a single theory.
[02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:15.580]   There is a multitude of theories,
[02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:17.700]   and it's not tightly constrained,
[02:22:17.700 --> 02:22:20.740]   and they cannot make predictions about black holes
[02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:22.580]   or about the beginning of the universe.
[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:24.700]   So at the moment, I say we are at a loss.
[02:22:24.700 --> 02:22:27.740]   And the way I feel about this concept
[02:22:27.740 --> 02:22:29.060]   of the theory of everything,
[02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:33.060]   we should wait until we get enough evidence to guide us.
[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:35.460]   And until then, there are many important problems
[02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:37.020]   that we can address.
[02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:40.780]   Why bang our head against the wall
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:43.380]   on a problem for which we have no guidance?
[02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:45.260]   - Right, we don't have a good dance partner
[02:22:45.260 --> 02:22:46.260]   in terms of evidence.
[02:22:46.260 --> 02:22:47.100]   - Exactly.
[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:49.980]   - I mean, it'd be interesting, Jessica said,
[02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:54.980]   the lab is one place to create universes or black holes,
[02:22:54.980 --> 02:22:58.180]   but it'd be fascinating if there is indeed a black hole
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:01.060]   in our solar system that you can interact with.
[02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:03.580]   So the problem with the origin of the universe
[02:23:03.580 --> 02:23:06.060]   is all you can do is collect data about it, right?
[02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:07.780]   You can't interact with it.
[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:10.540]   - Well, you can, for example, detect gravitational waves
[02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:12.460]   that emerged from that.
[02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:14.580]   And there is an effort to do that,
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:17.060]   and that could potentially tell us something.
[02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:21.860]   But yeah, it's a challenge, and that's why we're stuck.
[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:25.980]   So I should say, despite what physicists portray,
[02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:29.620]   that we live through an exceptional growth
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:31.540]   in our understanding of the universe,
[02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:33.900]   we're actually pretty much stuck, I would say,
[02:23:33.900 --> 02:23:36.700]   because we don't know the nature of the dark matter,
[02:23:36.700 --> 02:23:38.020]   most of the matter in the universe.
[02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:40.100]   We don't know what it is,
[02:23:40.100 --> 02:23:42.240]   and we don't know how the universe started.
[02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:45.900]   We don't know what happens in the interior of a black hole.
[02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:47.220]   - Because you've thought quite a bit
[02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:48.900]   about dark matter as well.
[02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:51.300]   Do you have any kind of interesting hypothesis?
[02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:55.140]   We already mentioned a few about what is dark matter
[02:23:55.140 --> 02:23:59.700]   and what are the possible paths that we could take
[02:23:59.700 --> 02:24:02.540]   to unlock the mystery of dark, what is dark matter?
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:04.940]   - Yeah, so what we need is some anomalies
[02:24:04.940 --> 02:24:08.300]   that would hint what the nature of the dark matter is,
[02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:09.940]   or to detect it in the laboratory.
[02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:12.320]   There are lots of laboratory experiments searching,
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:14.900]   but it's like searching for a needle in a haystack,
[02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:16.280]   'cause there are so many possibilities
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:18.880]   for the type of particle that it may be.
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:23.540]   But maybe at some point, we'll find either a particle
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:26.500]   or black holes as dark matter or something else.
[02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:28.420]   But at the moment-- - Can you also maybe,
[02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:31.460]   sorry to interrupt, comment about what is dark matter?
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:34.740]   Like what, it's just a name we're assigned to what?
[02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:38.220]   - So most of the community believes that it's a particle
[02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:41.540]   that we haven't yet detected.
[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:44.540]   It doesn't interact with light, so it's dark.
[02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:47.260]   But the question is, what does it interact with,
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:48.860]   and how can we find it?
[02:24:48.860 --> 02:24:53.020]   And for many years, physicists were guided by the idea
[02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:55.820]   that it's some extension of the standard model
[02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:58.540]   of particle physics, but then they said,
[02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:02.000]   oh, we will find some clues from the Large Hadron Collider
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:05.540]   about its nature, or maybe it's related to supersymmetry,
[02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:06.700]   which is a new symmetry
[02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:08.820]   that we haven't found any evidence for.
[02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:10.860]   In both cases, the Large Hadron Collider
[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:12.620]   did not give us any clues.
[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:16.500]   And other people searched for specific types of particles
[02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:18.400]   in the laboratory and didn't find any.
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:21.980]   A couple of years ago, actually,
[02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:24.620]   around the time that I worked on Oumuamua,
[02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:26.680]   I also worked on the possibility
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:28.620]   that the dark matter particles
[02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:32.900]   may have a small electric charge, which is a speculation.
[02:25:32.900 --> 02:25:37.460]   But nobody complained about it, and it was published,
[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:40.740]   and I regarded more of a speculation
[02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:43.500]   than the artificial origin of Oumuamua.
[02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:47.500]   And to me, as far as I'm concerned,
[02:25:47.500 --> 02:25:49.940]   I applied the same scientific tools in both cases.
[02:25:49.940 --> 02:25:53.420]   There is an anomaly that led me to that discussion,
[02:25:53.420 --> 02:25:56.140]   which has to do with the hydrogen being cold
[02:25:56.140 --> 02:25:58.020]   in the early universe more than we expected,
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:00.420]   so we suggested maybe the dark matter particles
[02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:02.260]   have some small charge.
[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:06.100]   But you deal with anomalies by exploring possibilities.
[02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:07.220]   That's the only way to do it,
[02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:09.820]   and then collecting more data to check those.
[02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:14.820]   And searching for technological signatures
[02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:21.620]   is the same as any other part of our scientific endeavor.
[02:26:21.620 --> 02:26:25.120]   We make hypotheses, and we collect data,
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:27.940]   and I don't see any reason for having a taboo
[02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:28.860]   on this subject.
[02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:32.380]   - In your childlike, open-minded excitement
[02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:35.220]   and approach to science, I think,
[02:26:35.220 --> 02:26:37.620]   to anyone listening to this, truly inspiring.
[02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:40.860]   I mean, the question I think is useful to ask
[02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:43.340]   is by way of advice for young people.
[02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:45.780]   A lot of young people listen to this,
[02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:47.740]   whether from all over the world,
[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:51.280]   and teenagers, undergraduate students,
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:56.220]   even graduate students, even young faculty,
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:26:58.340]   even older faculty, they're all young at heart.
[02:26:58.340 --> 02:26:59.900]   Like, there's many of us young at heart.
[02:26:59.900 --> 02:27:02.660]   Do you have advice for, let's focus on
[02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:05.220]   the traditionally defined sort of young folks,
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:07.320]   like undergraduate, do you have advice
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:10.220]   to give to young people like that today
[02:27:10.220 --> 02:27:12.780]   about life, maybe in general,
[02:27:12.780 --> 02:27:16.260]   maybe a life of curiosity in the sciences?
[02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:17.480]   - Definitely.
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:19.640]   Well, first I should confess that I enjoy
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:23.420]   working with young people much more than with senior people.
[02:27:23.420 --> 02:27:27.500]   And the reason is they don't carry a baggage of prejudice.
[02:27:27.500 --> 02:27:29.460]   They're not so self-centered.
[02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:31.260]   They're open to exploration.
[02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:34.860]   My advice, I mean, one of the lessons
[02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:37.260]   that took me a while to learn,
[02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:40.920]   and I should say I lost important opportunities
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:41.760]   as a result of that,
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:45.460]   so I would regard it as a mistake on my behalf,
[02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:49.860]   was to believe experts, so quote unquote.
[02:27:49.860 --> 02:27:52.860]   So on a number of occasions,
[02:27:52.860 --> 02:27:55.500]   I would come up with an original idea
[02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:57.900]   and then suggest it to an expert,
[02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:01.060]   someone that works in the same field for a while,
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:03.940]   and the expert would dismiss it,
[02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:06.580]   most of the time because it's new
[02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:09.760]   and was not explored, not because of the merit.
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:11.460]   And then what happened to me,
[02:28:11.460 --> 02:28:14.120]   several times, is that someone else
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:15.560]   would listen to the conversation
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:18.180]   or would hear me suggesting it,
[02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:21.560]   and I would give up because the expert said no,
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:25.720]   and then that someone else would develop it
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:28.700]   so that it becomes the hottest thing in this field.
[02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:31.900]   And once it happened to me multiple times,
[02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:34.820]   I then realized, the hell with the experts.
[02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:35.740]   (Sami laughs)
[02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:36.840]   They don't know what they're talking,
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:38.880]   they're just repeating the,
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:40.500]   they don't think creatively,
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:44.220]   they are being threatened by innovation, okay?
[02:28:44.220 --> 02:28:47.180]   And it's the natural reaction of someone
[02:28:47.180 --> 02:28:52.180]   that cares about their ego more than about the matter
[02:28:52.180 --> 02:28:53.140]   that we are discussing.
[02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:57.500]   And so I said, I don't care how many likes I have on Twitter,
[02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:00.260]   I don't care whether the experts say one thing or another,
[02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:02.900]   I will basically exercise my judgment
[02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:04.780]   and do the best I can.
[02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:07.900]   Turns out that I'm wrong, I made a mistake.
[02:29:07.900 --> 02:29:11.380]   That's part of the scientific endeavor.
[02:29:11.380 --> 02:29:14.220]   And it took me a while to recognize that,
[02:29:14.220 --> 02:29:16.300]   and it was a lot of wasted opportunities.
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:18.580]   So to the young people, I would recommend,
[02:29:18.580 --> 02:29:23.580]   don't listen to experts, carve your own path.
[02:29:23.580 --> 02:29:25.740]   Now, of course, you will be wrong,
[02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:29.060]   you should learn from experience, just like kids do,
[02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:30.620]   but do it yourself.
[02:29:32.940 --> 02:29:37.940]   - Your father died in 2017, your mother died in 2019.
[02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:43.100]   Do you miss them?
[02:29:43.100 --> 02:29:43.940]   - Very much so.
[02:29:43.940 --> 02:29:50.500]   - Is there a memory, that fond memory that stands out,
[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:53.820]   or maybe what have you learned from them?
[02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:59.420]   - From my mother, I mean, she was very much my inspiration
[02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:01.180]   for pursuing intellectual work,
[02:30:01.180 --> 02:30:05.380]   because she studied at the university,
[02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:08.980]   and then because of the Second World War,
[02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:12.060]   after the Second World War, she was born in Bulgaria,
[02:30:12.060 --> 02:30:14.380]   they immigrated to Israel.
[02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:19.380]   And she left university to work on a farm.
[02:30:19.380 --> 02:30:24.620]   And later in life, when all the kids left home,
[02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:27.740]   she went back to the university and finished the PhD.
[02:30:27.740 --> 02:30:31.660]   But she planted in me the intellectual curiosity
[02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:36.660]   and valuing learning, or acquiring knowledge
[02:30:36.660 --> 02:30:41.060]   as a very important element in life.
[02:30:41.060 --> 02:30:46.060]   And my love with philosophy came from attending classes
[02:30:46.060 --> 02:30:49.900]   that she took at the university.
[02:30:49.900 --> 02:30:54.900]   When I was a teenager, I was fortunate to go to some of these
[02:30:55.260 --> 02:30:57.740]   and they inspired me later on.
[02:30:57.740 --> 02:31:01.660]   And I'm very different than my colleagues, as you can tell,
[02:31:01.660 --> 02:31:03.980]   because my upbringing was quite different.
[02:31:03.980 --> 02:31:07.100]   And the only reason I'm doing physics or astrophysics
[02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:08.580]   is because of circumstances.
[02:31:08.580 --> 02:31:12.740]   At age 18, I was asked to serve in the military.
[02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:17.740]   And the only way for me to pursue intellectual work
[02:31:17.740 --> 02:31:21.540]   was to work on physics,
[02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:24.220]   because that was the closest to philosophy.
[02:31:24.220 --> 02:31:26.060]   And I was good at physics,
[02:31:26.060 --> 02:31:28.860]   so they admitted me to an elite program called Alpiot
[02:31:28.860 --> 02:31:33.020]   that allowed me to finish my PhD at age 24
[02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:37.900]   and to actually propose the first international project
[02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:40.540]   that was funded by the Star Wars initiative
[02:31:40.540 --> 02:31:42.140]   of Ronald Reagan.
[02:31:42.140 --> 02:31:45.660]   And that brought me to the US to visit Washington, DC,
[02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:47.140]   where we were funded from.
[02:31:47.140 --> 02:31:49.100]   And then on one of the visits,
[02:31:49.100 --> 02:31:53.660]   I went to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
[02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:56.220]   And met John Bacall
[02:31:56.220 --> 02:31:59.260]   that later offered me a five-year fellowship there
[02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:02.220]   under the condition that I'll switch to astrophysics.
[02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:03.980]   At which point, I said,
[02:32:03.980 --> 02:32:05.780]   "Okay, I cannot give up on this opportunity.
[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:08.260]   "I'll do it, switch to astrophysics."
[02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:12.300]   It felt like a forced marriage, kind of arranged marriage.
[02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:15.740]   And then I was offered the position at Harvard
[02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:17.180]   because nobody wanted that.
[02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:20.460]   They first selected someone else.
[02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:21.380]   And that someone said,
[02:32:21.380 --> 02:32:24.340]   "I don't want to become a junior faculty
[02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:25.900]   "at the Harvard Astronomy Department
[02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:29.180]   "because the chance for being promoted are very small."
[02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:30.540]   So he took another job.
[02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:32.180]   And then I was second in line.
[02:32:32.180 --> 02:32:33.020]   They gave it to me.
[02:32:33.020 --> 02:32:33.860]   I didn't care much
[02:32:33.860 --> 02:32:35.820]   'cause I could go back to the farm any day.
[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:37.340]   (Sherlock laughs)
[02:32:37.340 --> 02:32:40.220]   And after three years, I was tenured.
[02:32:40.220 --> 02:32:42.940]   And eventually, a decade later,
[02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:44.860]   became the chair of this department
[02:32:44.860 --> 02:32:46.260]   and served for nine years
[02:32:46.260 --> 02:32:49.060]   as the chair of the astronomy department at Harvard.
[02:32:49.060 --> 02:32:51.700]   But at that point, it became clear to me
[02:32:51.700 --> 02:32:54.660]   that I'm actually married to the love of my life.
[02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:56.620]   Even though it was an arranged marriage,
[02:32:56.620 --> 02:32:59.340]   there are many philosophical questions in astrophysics
[02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:00.460]   that we can address.
[02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:03.500]   But I'm still very different than my colleagues
[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:06.700]   that were focusing on technical skills
[02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:09.540]   in getting to this job.
[02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:14.860]   So my mother was really extremely instrumental
[02:33:14.860 --> 02:33:18.540]   in planting the seeds of thinking about the big picture.
[02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:20.420]   In me.
[02:33:20.420 --> 02:33:25.060]   Then my father, he was working in the farm
[02:33:25.060 --> 02:33:26.820]   and we didn't speak much
[02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:29.380]   because we sort of understood each other without speaking.
[02:33:29.380 --> 02:33:31.380]   (Sherlock laughs)
[02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:36.380]   But what he gave me is a sense of,
[02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:40.340]   that it's more important to do things
[02:33:40.340 --> 02:33:41.740]   than to talk about them.
[02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:45.260]   - I love the, I mean, my apologies,
[02:33:45.260 --> 02:33:47.340]   but MIT mind and hand.
[02:33:47.340 --> 02:33:50.820]   I love that there's the root of philosophy
[02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:53.020]   that you gained from your mom
[02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:56.700]   and the hand that action is all that ultimately
[02:33:56.700 --> 02:33:58.780]   in the end matters from your dad.
[02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:01.100]   That's really powerful.
[02:34:01.100 --> 02:34:05.620]   If we could take a small detour into philosophy,
[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:10.320]   is there by chance any books, authors,
[02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:11.780]   whether philosophical or not,
[02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:13.700]   you mentioned Sartre, that stand out to you
[02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:16.780]   that were formative in some small or big way
[02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:18.520]   that perhaps you would recommend to others,
[02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:22.260]   maybe when you were very young or maybe later on in life?
[02:34:22.260 --> 02:34:27.260]   - Well, actually, yeah, I read the number of existentialists
[02:34:27.260 --> 02:34:31.740]   that appealed to me because they were authentic.
[02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:35.480]   Sartre, he declined the Nobel prizes we discussed,
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:39.900]   but he also was mocking people
[02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:42.340]   that pretend to be something better than they are.
[02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:45.940]   He was living an authentic life that is sincere
[02:34:45.940 --> 02:34:47.340]   and that's what appealed to me.
[02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:51.380]   And Albert Camus was another French philosopher
[02:34:51.380 --> 02:34:53.580]   that advocated existentialism.
[02:34:53.580 --> 02:34:56.020]   That really appealed to me.
[02:34:56.020 --> 02:34:58.860]   - That's probably my favorite existentialist Camus, yeah.
[02:34:58.860 --> 02:35:01.060]   - Yeah, and he died at a young age
[02:35:01.060 --> 02:35:02.800]   in an accident, unfortunately.
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:08.980]   And then people like Nietzsche that broke conventions.
[02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:16.740]   And I noticed that Nietzsche is still extremely popular.
[02:35:16.740 --> 02:35:18.620]   That's quite surprising.
[02:35:18.620 --> 02:35:22.260]   He appeals to the young people of today.
[02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:26.340]   - People that, it's the childlike wonder about the world
[02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:28.620]   and he was unapologetic.
[02:35:28.620 --> 02:35:30.020]   You know, it's like most philosophers
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:32.660]   have a very strict adherence to terminology
[02:35:32.660 --> 02:35:35.180]   and to the practices, academic philosophers.
[02:35:35.180 --> 02:35:37.140]   And Nietzsche was full of contradictions
[02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:42.140]   and he just, I mean, he was just this big kid with opinions
[02:35:42.140 --> 02:35:45.580]   and thought deeply about this world
[02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:47.020]   and people are really attracted to that.
[02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:50.620]   And surprisingly, there's not enough people like that
[02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:53.080]   throughout history of philosophy.
[02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:55.780]   And that's why I think he's still drawn to him.
[02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:59.580]   - Yeah, to me what stands out is his statement
[02:35:59.580 --> 02:36:03.960]   that the best way to corrupt the mind of young people
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:08.960]   is to tell them that they should agree with the common view.
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:13.360]   And it goes back to the thread
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:14.860]   that went throughout discussion.
[02:36:14.860 --> 02:36:19.600]   - Yes, you've kind of suggested that we ought to be humble
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:21.340]   about our very own existence
[02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:25.680]   and that our existence lasts only a short time.
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:30.680]   We talked about you losing your father and your mother.
[02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:33.480]   Do you think about your own mortality?
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:35.480]   Are you afraid of death?
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:36.480]   - I'm not afraid.
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:37.760]   You know what Epicurus,
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:40.120]   actually Epicurus was a very wise person.
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:43.240]   According to Lucretius,
[02:36:43.240 --> 02:36:45.400]   Epicurus didn't leave anything in writing,
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:49.040]   but he said that he's never afraid of death
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:53.680]   because as long as he's around, death is not around.
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:57.140]   And when death will be around, he will not be around.
[02:36:57.140 --> 02:36:59.320]   So he will never meet death.
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:01.240]   So why should you be worried
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:03.240]   about something you will never meet?
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:06.160]   And it's an interesting philosophy of life.
[02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:07.720]   You shouldn't be afraid of something
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:09.560]   that you will never encounter.
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:12.080]   - But there's a finiteness to this experience.
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:12.920]   - Oh yeah.
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:14.440]   - We live every day.
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:18.000]   I mean, I think if we're being honest,
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:21.040]   we live every day as if it's gonna last forever.
[02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:24.840]   We often kind of don't contemplate the fact that it ends.
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:26.240]   You kind of have plans and goals
[02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:28.960]   and you have these possibilities.
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:30.920]   You have a kind of lingering thought,
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:33.120]   especially as you get older and older and older,
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:36.400]   that this is, especially when you lose friends,
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:40.680]   and then you start to realize it doesn't.
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:43.400]   But I don't know if you really are cognizant of that.
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:44.560]   I mean, because--
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:47.060]   - But you have to be careful not to be depressed by it
[02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:50.320]   because otherwise you lose the vitality, right?
[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:53.080]   So I think the most important thing to draw
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:56.160]   from knowing that you are short-lived
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:59.880]   is a sense of appreciation that you're alive.
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:01.060]   That's the first thing.
[02:38:01.060 --> 02:38:03.760]   But more importantly, a sense of modesty
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:06.960]   because how can anyone be arrogant
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:10.280]   if they kept at the same time this notion
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:11.120]   that they are short-lived?
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:12.600]   I mean, you cannot be arrogant
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:15.240]   because anything that you advocate for,
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:18.840]   you will not be around to do that in a hundred years.
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:21.920]   So people will just forget and move on.
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:25.080]   And if you keep that in mind,
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:27.400]   the Caesars in ancient Rome,
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:30.680]   they had a person next to them telling them,
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:32.820]   "Don't forget that you're immortal."
[02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:35.080]   You know, there was a person with that duty
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:37.880]   because the Caesars thought that they are all powerful.
[02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:43.160]   And they had, for a good reason,
[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:47.080]   someone they hired to whisper in their ear,
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:48.720]   "Don't forget that you're immortal."
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:49.760]   - Yeah.
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:54.760]   Well, you're somebody, one of the most respected,
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:56.940]   famous scientists in the world,
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:38:59.600]   sitting on a farm, gazing up at the stars.
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:01.280]   So you seem like an appropriate person
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:04.200]   to ask the completely inappropriate question
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:06.600]   of what do you think is the meaning of it all?
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:07.960]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:10.280]   - That's an excellent question.
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:13.920]   And if we ever find an alien that we can converse with,
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:15.240]   I would like to answer this.
[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:17.640]   I would like to ask for an answer to this question
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:19.240]   'cause--
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:21.080]   - Would they have a different opinion, you think?
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:22.260]   - Well, they might be wiser
[02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:24.400]   because they lived around for a while,
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:27.120]   but I'm afraid they will be silent.
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:29.160]   I'm afraid they will not have a good answer.
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:34.160]   And I think it's the process
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:38.120]   that you should get satisfied by,
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:41.560]   the process of learning you should enjoy.
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:45.400]   Okay, so it's not so much that there is a meaning.
[02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:49.400]   In fact, there is, as far as I can tell,
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:50.700]   things just exist.
[02:39:50.700 --> 02:39:55.520]   And I think it's inappropriate for us
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:58.220]   to assign a meaning for our existence
[02:39:58.220 --> 02:40:02.560]   because as a civilization, we will eventually perish
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:06.000]   and nothing will be, just another planet
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:07.560]   on which life died.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:12.080]   And if you look at the big scheme of things,
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.160]   who cares?
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:14.260]   Who cares?
[02:40:14.260 --> 02:40:17.680]   And how can we assign significance to what we are doing?
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:20.880]   So if you said the meaning of life is this,
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:23.560]   well, it will not be around in a billion years.
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:26.720]   It cannot be the meaning of life
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:29.100]   because nothing will be around.
[02:40:29.100 --> 02:40:32.260]   So I think we should just enjoy the process.
[02:40:32.260 --> 02:40:35.740]   And it's like many other things in life.
[02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:38.660]   You enjoy good food, okay?
[02:40:38.660 --> 02:40:41.160]   And you can enjoy learning.
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:42.000]   Why?
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:46.300]   Because it makes you appreciate better
[02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:47.780]   the environment that you live in.
[02:40:47.780 --> 02:40:50.780]   And sometimes people think religion, for example,
[02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:54.780]   is in conflict with science, spirituality.
[02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:57.000]   That's not true.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:02.560]   If you see a watch and you look at it from the outside,
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:05.620]   you might say, oh, that's interesting.
[02:41:05.620 --> 02:41:07.300]   But then if you start to open it up
[02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:10.320]   and learn about how it works, you appreciate it more.
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:14.240]   So science is the way to learn about how the world works.
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:18.180]   And it's not in conflict to the meaning
[02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:19.440]   that you assign to all of this,
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:23.380]   but it helps you appreciate the world better.
[02:41:23.380 --> 02:41:25.660]   So in fact, I would think that a religious person
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:28.900]   should promote science because it gives you
[02:41:28.900 --> 02:41:31.900]   a better appreciation of what's around you.
[02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:35.340]   It's like if you buy in a grocery,
[02:41:35.340 --> 02:41:39.940]   you buy something, a bunch of fruits
[02:41:39.940 --> 02:41:41.380]   that are packed together,
[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:43.180]   and you can't see from the outside
[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:45.200]   exactly what kind of fruits are inside.
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:47.220]   But if you open it up and study,
[02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:49.700]   you appreciate better the merchandise that you get, right?
[02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:51.340]   So you pay the same amount of money,
[02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:53.340]   but at least you know what's inside.
[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:56.300]   So why don't we figure out what the world is about,
[02:41:56.300 --> 02:41:58.700]   what the universe contains, what is the dark matter?
[02:41:58.700 --> 02:42:02.100]   It will help us appreciate the bigger picture,
[02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:05.740]   and then you can assign your own flavor
[02:42:05.740 --> 02:42:06.840]   to what it means.
[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:13.260]   - I think I'm truly grateful that a person like you exists
[02:42:13.260 --> 02:42:15.420]   at the center of the scientific community
[02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:20.420]   gives me faith and hope about this big journey
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:21.660]   that we call science.
[02:42:21.660 --> 02:42:25.700]   So thank you for writing the book you wrote recently.
[02:42:25.700 --> 02:42:28.980]   You have many other books and articles
[02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:31.140]   that I think people should definitely read.
[02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:33.780]   And thank you for wasting all this time with me.
[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:35.020]   It's truly an honor.
[02:42:35.020 --> 02:42:36.380]   Thank you so much. - It was not a waste at all,
[02:42:36.380 --> 02:42:37.460]   and thank you for having me.
[02:42:37.460 --> 02:42:40.300]   I learned a lot from your questions and your remarks.
[02:42:40.300 --> 02:42:42.340]   Thank you. - Thank you.
[02:42:42.340 --> 02:42:44.700]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Avi Loeb,
[02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:46.300]   and thank you to our sponsors,

[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:00.940]   So the choice is a fasting app, fasting fuel,
[02:43:00.940 --> 02:43:03.340]   fast-breaking delicious meals,
[02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:06.140]   and a history podcast that has very little,
[02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:08.560]   as far as I know, to do with fasting.
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:09.980]   Choose wisely, my friends.

[02:43:17.700 --> 02:43:19.460]   from Albert Einstein.
[02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:22.100]   "The important thing is not to stop questioning.
[02:43:22.100 --> 02:43:25.060]   Curiosity has its own reason for existence.
[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:27.220]   One cannot help but be in awe
[02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:29.860]   when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity,
[02:43:29.860 --> 02:43:33.540]   of life, of the marvelous structure of reality.
[02:43:33.540 --> 02:43:36.580]   It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend
[02:43:36.580 --> 02:43:39.740]   a little of this mystery every day."
[02:43:39.740 --> 02:43:42.500]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
