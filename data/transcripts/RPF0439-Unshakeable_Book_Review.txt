[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   A few minutes ago, I posted a message in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group that
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.920]   reads this, said, "I'm about to record my review of Tony Robbins' new book, Unshakeable.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.080]   Should I do it in my current mood as ticked off angry Joshua and rip it to shreds or should
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.560]   I do it in my calm, collected, and intellectually neutral voice, carefully presenting the good,
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.880]   the bad, and the ugly?
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.880]   What do you want?"
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:38.640]   Well, the responses were mixed, but in general, the voting was, "Give us the real version,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.000]   but we're happy with angry."
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.440]   So I got a hot mic, a theme song, and a book to review.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.880]   Let's see how this goes.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:01:04.240]   You're going to find out with me.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.400]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I am your host.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.680]   And today, we review Tony Robbins' new financial book, Unshakeable, your financial freedom
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:36.560]   playbook, creating peace of mind in a world of volatility.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.240]   Way back in episode 109 of Radical Personal Finance, I reviewed Tony Robbins' other money
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.800]   book called Money, Master of the Game, Seven Simple Steps to Financial Freedom.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.960]   And that interview was pretty large and pretty epic.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.400]   I called it a comprehensive review and critique of the book.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.200]   And I think it was about three hours.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560]   Very popular show, but it was about three hours.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.440]   And in that one, I went through the good, the bad, the ugly, all of it, and kind of
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.420]   demonstrated how the book was.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.200]   And in many ways, Unshakeable is almost exactly like Money.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.040]   In many ways, there are parallels between the content.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.280]   Unshakeable references Money.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.920]   He treats Money as a quicker version of the book.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.740]   He creates Unshakeable as a quicker version of the Money book.
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.140]   He says in the beginning of the book, there are three reasons why he wanted to write this
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.140]   new book.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.540]   Number one was to reach as many people as possible with a shorter book than Money, also
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.900]   because of seeing fear all around, and to show you how to avoid getting eaten by sharks.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.620]   And so the books are complementary.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.740]   Now today, I will not do a three-hour critique of this book.
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.740]   I don't think it's – it just doesn't merit it.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.300]   I'm just going to do kind of a quick overview, tell you what I like about the book, also
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.920]   tell you what I don't like about the book.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.420]   Details on all of that in just a moment.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.320]   But first, sponsor of today's show is You Need a Budget, the budgeting software that
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   I use.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.620]   And one of my biggest disappointments with Tony's books is he focuses on the things
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.900]   that I think are mostly irrelevant to many people's financial lives.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.580]   If we were to talk about the importance and the value of investing and having the most
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.420]   perfectly allocated portfolio versus the importance and value of budgeting, I think you got to
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.180]   start with the importance and value of budgeting.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.100]   The portfolio is important but the portfolio is only important once you have a lot of money
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.540]   saved up.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.340]   However, you'll never get there if you don't master budgeting.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.380]   So let me try to set a stronger foundation for you by encouraging you to download a free
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.460]   34-day trial of the YNAB You Need a Budget budgeting software.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.460]   Do that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/YNAB, again, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/YNAB, free
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:10.620]   34-day trial of the beautiful budgeting software that the YNAB team has created.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.580]   Really Jesse Mecham, the founder of YNAB, has created the most useful and powerful financial
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.020]   planning tool because it actually allows you to plan what to do with the money in your
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.900]   account, in your checking account.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.260]   It solves the fundamental problem of budgeting which is not knowing how to allocate the money
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.740]   that's actually in your checking account.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.980]   The way that most people approach budgeting is broken because they start with this perfect
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.700]   month and then they kind of make this the model sample month and they have no tracking
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.700]   mechanism.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.140]   YNAB solves those problems.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.740]   Best thing you can do for your financial health is to start, if you're not already using
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.900]   it, at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/YNAB, download the free trial, free 34-day trial, and in
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.940]   addition, take the free classes on how to use the software.
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.940]   The software is powerful but it's also a little bit unique and you'll want to learn how it
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.940]   works by taking all the free classes.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.900]   Probably the best financial move you could make if you're not already using it, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/YNAB.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.300]   All right, the book, Unshakeable.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.100]   Big promise up front, your financial freedom playbook, creating peace of mind in a world
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.100]   of volatility.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.100]   Let me just get straight to the opinion that I have of this book.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.620]   The book is divided into three distinct parts, three sections.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.640]   Section one is called Wealth, the Rulebook.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.740]   Section two is the Unshakeable Playbook and section three is the Psychology of Wealth.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.260]   Now perhaps unsurprisingly, Tony is better at different parts of this than others.
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.820]   I'd like to say the good, the bad, and the ugly but it starts the other way around.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.380]   I'll call it the ugly, the bad, and the good.
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.620]   Section three, the Psychology of Wealth, is actually quite good because that's where Tony
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.500]   Robbins is a real expert.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.140]   He seems to be that.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.860]   Either he's an expert and it's very good or I just don't know enough about psychology
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.800]   to spot the flaws, which is very possible, where I do know enough about money and financial
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.300]   planning to spot the flaws.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.140]   But the third section of the book is excellent, the Psychology of Wealth.
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.460]   In that, and let me lead with a strong, he talks about two chapters here, silencing the
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.900]   enemy within, six biggest mistakes that investors make and how to avoid them.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.900]   Here they are.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.200]   Mistake number one is seeking confirmation of your beliefs, why the best investors welcome
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.020]   opinions that contradict their own.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.340]   This is something we're all guilty of.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.660]   We like to engage in confirmation bias and find people that agree with us so that we
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.740]   feel really good about ourselves and feel really good about our opinions.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.700]   Unfortunately, this is really bad as a practice if you want to learn and make progress.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.220]   You have to ask harder questions.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.220]   So it's good to always find people that disagree with you and listen to them and to their arguments.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.260]   Mistake number two is mistaking recent events for ongoing trends, why most investors buy
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.180]   the wrong thing at exactly the wrong moment.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.940]   Here he goes into the concept of recency bias.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.700]   It's very easy for us to take our recent history and try to extrapolate that out and say, "Oh,
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.980]   hey, this is always going to be this way."
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.740]   And so one of the most important things you need to train yourself to do is to have a
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.620]   long-term time perspective, to recognize that seasons come and seasons go.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.780]   If you're in the middle of a crisis, it won't always be this way.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.080]   And if you're in the middle of a euphoric, phenomenal experience, it won't always be
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.080]   this way.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.100]   And that applies without question to money and to investing.
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.540]   Mistake number three is overconfidence.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.540]   Get real.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.660]   We're trading our abilities and our knowledge as a recipe for disaster.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.980]   No question this is absolutely true.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.100]   We are so prone to overconfidence.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.540]   And he makes a point here in his research that men are especially prone to overconfidence
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.240]   when it comes to investing.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:59.260]   Men traded 45% more than women, reducing their net returns by 2.65% per year because of worse
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.260]   trading.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.020]   That rings true to me based upon my experience.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.700]   We have to be very careful to guard against overconfidence.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.600]   One of the best ways, and the solution, get real, get honest, he applies that in terms
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.540]   of actually asking yourself, "Do you actually have a special advantage when it comes to
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.540]   investing?"
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.940]   The answer is probably not.
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.660]   I'll expand that to say one of the best ways to overcome the mistake of overconfidence
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.740]   is to get good data, is to get good data on your actual performance.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.160]   Easier said than done.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.140]   Mistake four is greed, gambling, and the quest for home runs.
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.820]   It's tempting to swing for the fences, but victory goes to the steady survivors.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.900]   It's a marathon and not a sprint.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:49.120]   And good investing absolutely is... you need to learn that when it comes to good investing.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.540]   You really don't need Tony Robbins to tell you this if you're a Bible reader.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.900]   King Solomon taught us that about 3,000 years ago when he, in the book of Proverbs, chapter
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:03.660]   13, verse 11, King Solomon wrote, "Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.140]   little by little will increase it."
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.580]   Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.420]   So no question, it's a marathon and not a sprint.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:22.380]   And it's very important to focus on steady growth, a concept we consistently talk about
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.200]   here on the show.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.400]   Mistake number five, staying home.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.540]   It's a big world out there.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.460]   So how come most investors stay so close to home?
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.820]   Here at mistake five, Tony's just talking about the...
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.940]   There's a name that the investment psychologists use for this, familiarity bias or something
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.200]   like that, where we usually think that if you're a US American listener, the United
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.660]   States of America is the best place in the world to invest.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:52.360]   We usually look to buy real estate right next door to us instead of being willing to look
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.520]   in a town across the state or another state or another country.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.940]   And so the solution here is to expand your horizons and have a broader perspective.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.180]   Mistake number six, negativity and loss aversion.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.220]   Your brain wants you to be fearful in times of turmoil.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.560]   Don't listen to it.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.800]   And here the advice is, if you're prepared for times of turmoil, then you can be ready
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   to shop.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.840]   And this really is so valuable.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.780]   If you've done your homework on the market that you're in, you can approach, especially...
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.780]   Let me rephrase.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.180]   If you've done your homework on the market that you're in, and if you've prepared for
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:33.740]   disaster in your own personal life, in your own personal finances, then at that point
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:40.980]   in time, you can position yourself to be greedy when others are fearful instead of being fearful
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.120]   when everyone else is fearful.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.260]   And that's something that you can teach yourself to do.
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.260]   No question.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:52.380]   In chapter nine, Real Wealth talks about the importance of simply recognizing the gratitude
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.380]   of life.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.380]   And so frankly, this third section of Tony's book is good.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.700]   It's pretty good.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.700]   Good stuff in here.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.700]   Good.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.780]   I like the mistakes and I like the solutions.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.420]   So that is the good.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.500]   Flipping back to the middle section, section two, here's what he calls the unshakable playbook.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.500]   He gives four...
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.160]   He gives what he calls the core four, four principles that can help guide every investment
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.020]   decision that you make.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.040]   Now, let me give you these four principles.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:27.460]   These principles are useful in concept and incoherent in application.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.700]   Core principle one is don't lose.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:36.940]   Here of course, referring to the most famous of ideas that rule number one with money is
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.340]   not losing money.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.820]   And he very much focuses on...
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.860]   But the best investors are obsessed with avoiding losses.
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.860]   Why?
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.500]   Because they understand a simple but profound fact.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.980]   The more money you lose, the harder it is to get back to where you started.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.500]   So without question, this is an important one to focus on.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.460]   Core principle number one, don't lose.
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:02.740]   The reason this is incoherent is nowhere in the book are we taught how to avoid losing
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.740]   money.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.980]   On the next page, page 98, Tony writes, "But in practical terms, how can you actually avoid
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.980]   losing money?"
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.420]   Well, for a start, it's important to recognize that financial markets are wildly unpredictable.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.540]   The most successful investors recognize that none of us can consistently predict what the
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.540]   future holds.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.180]   With that in mind, they always guard against the risk of unexpected events and the risk
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.580]   that they themselves can be wrong regardless of how smart they are.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.700]   And basically here he talks about how asset allocation is a guarding against being wrong.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.420]   So don't lose money is a really nice concept.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.060]   I love it as a concept.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.240]   But practically speaking, you can have a great asset allocation plan and all that means is
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.940]   you lose money in some corners of your portfolio and not in others.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:48.780]   So big idea, big principle, incoherent in application and nowhere in the book are we
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.260]   taught how to actually do this.
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.500]   Core principle number two, asymmetric risk and reward.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.260]   According to conventional wisdom, you need to take big risks to achieve big returns.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.220]   But the best investors don't fall for this high risk, high return myth.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:09.460]   Instead, they hunt for investment opportunities that offer what they call asymmetric risk
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.460]   and reward.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.620]   A fancy way of saying that the rewards should vastly outweigh the risks.
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.120]   In other words, these winning investors always seek to risk as little as possible to make
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.940]   as much as possible.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.260]   That's the investors equivalent of nirvana.
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.060]   Now I love this idea.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:31.420]   I love the idea of asymmetric risk and I love the idea of reducing risk across the board.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.740]   But once again, incoherent in that there's no application given that can actually be
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.380]   applied to you and me as an individual.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.660]   And here's where I'll get to, let me just air here, one of my biggest complaints about
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.660]   this whole book.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.180]   These concepts are great.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.300]   They're not well suited to the stock market.
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:58.140]   And this book is in essence a sales pitch for utilizing Tony's company services to help
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.700]   you invest your stocks.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.780]   And I'll get to that in a moment because that's section one.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.700]   These principles are so great, but they're incoherent because they're trying to be applied
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.580]   to the stock market.
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:17.220]   And there's no possible way that you and I as individuals are going to get an asymmetric
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.700]   risk and reward as individual investors in index funds.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.340]   You know the person who gets the asymmetric risk and reward?
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.660]   The financial manager.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.840]   The person who runs the portfolio.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.700]   When I handled portfolios before, I got an asymmetric risk and reward.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.660]   I would get paid fees based upon the management of client assets.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:45.500]   I had no risk because it wasn't my money, but I had an asymmetric potential for reward
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:55.980]   in the fact that I was able to gain from the growth of my client's portfolios.
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.020]   That's how you get asymmetric risk and reward.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.660]   You don't get it from buying index funds.
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.780]   It doesn't happen.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.580]   You get it from writing books to get people to buy index funds.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.900]   And we'll get to the brilliance of Tony here in his book in a moment.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.980]   Core principle number three, tax efficiency.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:18.200]   As we discussed earlier, taxes can easily wipe out 30% or more of your investment returns
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   if you're not careful.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.100]   Yet, mutual fund companies love to tout their pre-tax returns, obscuring the reality that
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:32.060]   there's only one number that truly matters, the net amount that you actually get to keep.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:37.660]   Now, without question, tax efficiency is massively important.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.680]   And tax efficiency in your investments is massively important.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:50.680]   And tax efficiency of index funds is an incredible advantage that they have over active funds.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:56.620]   But this paragraph illustrates everything that makes me so angry about this book.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:01.180]   It's the conflation of two ideas that are not logically connected.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.140]   This is – I am more and more convinced that if you want to study anything and if we want
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:12.100]   to teach our children anything, one of the most important things to do is to teach our
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.420]   children logic and to teach the study of logic.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.340]   Because if you study logic and you just study – and it doesn't take a lot.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.940]   Just memorize and learn a dozen or two dozen logical fallacies and start to look for them
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.240]   and you'll see them everywhere.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:33.340]   Because this paragraph right here with regard to tax efficiency is a classic – in my opinion,
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:38.300]   a classic definition of a non sequitur, the non sequitur logical fallacy.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.400]   Non sequitur means I think does not follow literally in the Latin – the Latin definition
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.160]   doesn't follow.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:52.100]   And a non sequitur is an inference that does not follow from the premises where – or
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.560]   a statement that does not follow logically from or is not clearly related to anything
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.960]   previously said.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.580]   And I'll give you some more just horrifying examples of that in this book.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.100]   But just right here as I'm trying to get through the simplest of principles, we have
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.380]   to tackle it.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.720]   As we discussed earlier, taxes can easily wipe out 30% or more of your investment returns
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.100]   if you're not careful.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.100]   Stop.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.100]   Is that true?
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.980]   Yes, it is.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.380]   That's an easily true statement.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.520]   That's a valid and true premise.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.660]   Yet mutual fund companies love to tout their pre-tax returns.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.860]   Stop.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:33.280]   Does that relate to the 30% – to the 30% statement before that?
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:39.900]   The point that he's trying to allege here is that because index funds are more tax efficient,
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:46.700]   because the portfolio managers don't trade the portfolio as quickly and when you're
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:51.220]   managing a mutual fund portfolio, anytime you trade a stock, you buy or sell, you're
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.880]   going to incur taxation on a gain or you're going to recognize a loss which can offset
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.320]   some of your other gains.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:06.060]   But you realize taxes when you sell and mutual funds don't sell as much because there are
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:11.060]   far fewer fundamental transactions in the portfolio.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.460]   So that's the point that he's trying to make.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:18.380]   But you're supposed to infer from that that this is all a game, that mutual fund companies
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:26.220]   love to tout their pre-tax returns in order to, as he continues, have the effect of obscuring
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.180]   the reality that there's only one number that truly matters, the net amount that you
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.960]   actually get to keep.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.920]   That is a silly, silly inference to draw.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:45.860]   The reason that mutual fund companies tout their pre-tax returns is because mutual fund
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:52.940]   companies are pass-through organizations which don't pay taxes at the entity level.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:58.460]   The individual investor pays taxes on their profits and it's the individual investor's
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:04.780]   tax rates and tax decisions that will affect what the actual level of taxation is, thus
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:10.540]   affecting the actual returns of the portfolio.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.980]   That's the fundamental truth.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:18.420]   So how on earth could a mutual fund company give their post-tax returns when they don't
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.300]   pay taxes at the entity level, when the taxes are pass-through?
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.040]   They charge a management fee.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.740]   The individual organizers and managers of the fund pay taxes.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.340]   But the fund itself does not pay tax at the entity level.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:38.700]   That's why you report taxes on a pre-tax basis.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.980]   It's exactly the same thing.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.580]   Think about this.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.460]   Salaries.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:51.500]   If you go and you're applying for a job and job A offers you $100,000 per year salary
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:57.980]   and job B offers you a $200,000 a year salary, are they trying to hide the amount of money
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.880]   that you're going to pay on taxes or are they using the only basis of comp comparison that
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.940]   they can use to offer you the job?
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.180]   They don't know how much you're going to pay in taxes.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.420]   They don't know what your deductions are, what your credits are.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.420]   They don't know your other income.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.660]   They don't know how much unearned income you have.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.900]   There's no possible way that an employer can say, "Well, we're going to offer you here
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.580]   an $82,000 per year post-tax salary."
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.520]   And the other employer can say, "I'm actually going to offer you $147,000 per year post-tax
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.380]   salary because I've calculated your state and federal income taxes."
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.720]   This is stupid.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.220]   This is utterly stupid.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.140]   It's trying to find malice in an area where there's not.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.560]   Now, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I can't find any way that I am.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.200]   You prove me wrong if I'm being too strong in my allegation.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.500]   But this is a non sequitur.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.100]   This is a logical fallacy.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:53.620]   This is the connection of two things that are not fundamental related.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.660]   There's not a causative relationship here and you can't prove from the fact that mutual
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:03.260]   fund companies advertise pre-tax returns, you can't prove that there's malice and malintent
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:08.540]   in their heart any more than you can prove that two employers who are publicizing pre-tax
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:13.020]   incomes for you are trying to rip you off somehow.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.300]   Core principle number four, diversification.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:19.220]   The fourth and final principle in the core four is perhaps the most obvious and fundamental
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.540]   of all, diversification.
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.380]   In its essence, it's what almost everyone knows.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.580]   Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:31.220]   But there's a difference between knowing what to do and actually doing what you know.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.300]   As Princeton professor Burton Malkiel told me, there are four important ways to diversify
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.300]   effectively.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.580]   One, diversify across asset classes.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.740]   Two, diversify within asset classes.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.740]   Three, diversify across markets, countries, and currencies around the world.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.980]   Four, diversify across time.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.220]   Now, is there anything wrong with that?
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   No.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.160]   Diversification is a fundamentally valuable principle.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.740]   It is crucial to the management, the excellent management of a portfolio.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.860]   You've got to diversify your portfolio.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:10.140]   But the reason why this angers me is because the entire section one was talking about stocks
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.500]   and there was no mention of diversification.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.940]   Rather, all of the data that's presented is about stocks.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.980]   All of the data is about basically the US market.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:24.420]   All of the graphs are of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the returns of the S&P 500.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.080]   You throw an entire wrench into section one when all of a sudden in section two you start
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.080]   talking about diversification.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.580]   Now all of a sudden when you were talking about having a 0.05% expense ratio on a Vanguard
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:41.020]   massive stock index fund in the US stock market, you get all destroyed when all of a sudden
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:46.300]   you have to start calculating expense ratios on a bond fund, indexed or not.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:52.460]   All of the arguments about how obvious it was that everybody should buy index funds
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.860]   completely fall apart when you start talking about bond funds and you try to figure out
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:02.660]   bond index funds and is there a value in an actively managed bond fund versus a passively
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.060]   managed bond fund.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.740]   And the argument is not nearly as strong, but we're just going to skip that whole thing.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.740]   Or what about real estate?
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:14.720]   How do you diversify into real estate but still do it with a 0.05% expense ratio?
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.460]   So once again, incoherent.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:22.500]   It's a good principle, it's valuable, but it came after section one.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.460]   Now let's go to the ugly.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.900]   Section one is, when I got to the end of it, a few pages in I was angry and then when I
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:34.940]   got to the end of it I was very close not being able to finish the book.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.260]   It's a rare book that I don't finish.
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.620]   I'm good at finishing books that I don't like.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:45.440]   But in this case, and I'm glad I did finish it because section three was good.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.940]   Section one is very frustrating.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.580]   He gives here a few basic things.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.140]   There are five chapters in section one.
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:59.660]   Section one is, chapter one is unshakable power and peace of mind in a world of uncertainty.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.140]   Chapter two, winter is coming, but when?
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:07.540]   These seven facts will free you from the fear of corrections and crashes.
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.860]   Chapter three, hidden fees and half-truths.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.620]   How Wall Street fools you into overpaying for underperformance.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.980]   Chapter four, rescuing our retirement plans.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.780]   What your 401k provider doesn't want you to know.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.460]   And chapter five, who can you really trust?
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.700]   Pulling back the curtain on the tricks of the trade.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.700]   So let's talk about these chapters because the simplest way for me to do it is to give
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.620]   you my chapter titles.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.580]   Chapter one, unshakable.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.860]   There are problems and the financial industry is the problem and you the investor of the
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.740]   problem, but we can solve it if you'll keep reading.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:46.460]   I wasn't very angry with chapter one, although I was a little bit, which we'll get to in
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.460]   a moment.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.980]   But there are, that's my chapter one.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.340]   Chapter two, winter is coming, but when?
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:58.420]   AKA, let me sell you that you should invest in stocks even though they're very volatile.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.860]   Let me sell you on the idea that you should invest in stocks even though they're very
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.100]   volatile.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.920]   Chapter three, hidden fees and half-truths.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.840]   My version.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.900]   Chapter three, let me sell you on the fact that you should only ever invest in index
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.600]   funds, not in actively traded funds.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.860]   Chapter four, by the way, nothing wrong with that, but that's an accurately titled chapter.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.160]   Chapter four, rescuing our retirement plans.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:30.740]   Let me sell you on the fact that you should use America's Best 401k, which is a company
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:35.220]   that I'm a financial partner in and it's the best company for you to use for your manager
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.120]   401k.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.180]   Chapter five, who can you really trust?
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.220]   My title.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.460]   Chapter five, let me sell you on the fact that you should use my company, Creative Planning,
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:51.220]   for your personal investment portfolio management, because that's what's sold in each of these
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.540]   chapters.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.300]   There is nothing wrong with that sale.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:08.460]   I am slightly envious of Tony Robbins, a marketing genius, because if I still owned a financial
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:13.700]   planning firm, he is doing exactly what I would do.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.460]   The thing that made me so angry when I was a licensed financial advisor was that so many
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:23.260]   other people seemed to be able to create good marketing programs that brought clients to
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.460]   the door.
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:29.740]   But my industry was stuck in this model from 1947 where you pick up the phone and you randomly
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:34.900]   call people constantly and you don't have any way to make them come to you.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.740]   I studied the world of marketing.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.340]   I studied the world of direct marketing and I said, "Look, this can be done completely
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.340]   differently.
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:49.300]   Why am I spending time, my time, my hours, sitting here in a system that was built 60
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.100]   years ago, wasting time individually reaching out to individuals?
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:59.460]   Why don't I build a marketing machine that does the work for me?"
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.180]   I saw other people doing it.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.740]   I saw so many other people doing it, but I wasn't allowed to do it.
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.700]   That drove me nuts.
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.980]   I don't think there's anything wrong with either of the approaches.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:20.300]   I have nothing but respect for Tony and I think this book is a brilliant business move.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:26.460]   It's very possible that someday I will copy exactly what he's done with it because what
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:33.260]   he's done has been absolutely brilliant from a business perspective.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.260]   Absolutely brilliant.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.500]   I hope this is not creating cognitive dissonance for you because I admire it.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.380]   I'm just giving you a review of the book.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.820]   Just because it's a brilliant business move doesn't mean that I think it's a great financial
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.820]   book.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:49.980]   Now, more reasons on why I don't think it's a great financial book in a moment, but that's
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.980]   what this is.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:28:01.140]   This book is a 220-ish page brochure for his various financial planning firms, the ones
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.260]   that he's a partner in.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.180]   That doesn't make it bad, but just that you need to know what it is.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:14.820]   In many ways, you could compare this to the mutual fund brochures that are published by
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.620]   the various mutual fund companies.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.140]   Ideally mutual fund brochures are educational pieces.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.580]   I used to like some of these when I was an advisor.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.260]   When I was an advisor, the wholesalers come, the mutual fund salespeople, they're called
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.260]   wholesalers.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.900]   They wholesale the funds to the advisors.
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.540]   They would come and they give the brochures.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:37.020]   These brochures are very, very valuable because they teach clients a lot of valuable information.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:42.140]   For example, some of the charts that he uses in here, he uses in the middle of the book,
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:48.740]   he talks about how the damage if you missed out on some of the best days in the market,
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.900]   how bad your returns are if you just miss out on the top 10 days.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:58.340]   It's pretty sobering.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:05.700]   The S&P 500 index, the data set here is the index annualized total return from 1996 to
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:11.860]   2015 from the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:21.220]   The S&P 500 index returned during that 20-year time period from '96 to 2015, 8.2%.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:26.180]   But if you weren't invested on the 10 top days of the market, that return dropped to
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:32.180]   4.5% showing how bunched the returns are, especially the positive returns.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:38.500]   If you weren't invested on the top 20 days, your 8.2% return drops to 2.1%.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:46.220]   If you missed the top 30 days, your 8.2% return dropped to 0.0%.
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:51.100]   If you missed the top 40 days in the market, only 40 days out of a 20-year time period,
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:56.900]   your 8.2% positive return dropped to a negative 2% return.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:02.820]   Now obviously, no investor is ever actually going to hit that number because who sells
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:07.020]   on day one, misses the next day, and then buys back in on day three.
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.020]   This is silly.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:12.380]   It's a dynamic exercise to prove a point that the returns in mutual fund and in stock market
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.860]   investing are bunched.
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:18.000]   But this exact same chart used to appear in the brochures that I would use for various
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.140]   mutual funds to display them to clients.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:24.420]   I would use them as teaching tools to try to teach these exact concepts.
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:30.460]   And what Tony has done in the sales process here is exactly the sales process that I used
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.540]   to do for my individual clients.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.260]   It's fantastic.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.220]   The man is a master of psychology.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.220]   He's so good.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:43.020]   Chapter 1, Unshakeable, is all about getting you to visualize what you want, which is financial
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:48.720]   security and financial freedom, but then to also bring in and cause you a sense of concern
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.460]   over what you might not know.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.920]   And the fact is there are big dangers, and I can help you with that.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.340]   Number two is to sell on the idea of stocks, even though they're very volatile.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.060]   I've done that sales presentation so many times using the same data and the same approaches
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.660]   that he uses here.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.580]   Section three, hidden fees and half-truths.
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.840]   Talk about the problems.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.300]   This is where you get into differentiation.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.780]   This is exactly what a financial advisor needs to do, is talk about why you're different.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:20.660]   When I closed my previous firm, I filed paperwork to start and set up my own RIA, Registered
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.900]   Investment Advisory firm.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.460]   I never actually got it distributed because Radical Personal Finance started to experience
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.980]   success, and I realized I couldn't do both well at that time.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.180]   I may do it in the future.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.180]   You never know.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.940]   But I couldn't do it well at that time, and so I shuttered it.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:43.100]   And my plan was I was going to be a fee-only advisor of fiduciary, which is what he sells
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.300]   in chapter five, Who Can You Really Trust?
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.560]   And I would have sold my clients on why you should work with me as a fee-only fiduciary,
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.560]   what the benefit was.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.200]   My firm was called Fiduciary Financial Consulting, for crying out loud.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:59.400]   And then I would have – in that term, I had decided to use a DFA, Dimensional Fund
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:06.080]   Advisors platform, which is exclusively index funds with a slight difference from the standard
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.560]   Vanguard approach.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.880]   And so I would have sold my clients on why they should invest using index funds in that
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.360]   particular situation.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:18.480]   I didn't have any plans to work with – his chapter four is about America's Best 401(k).
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:25.720]   I didn't have any plans to work with specific retirement plans.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   But who knows?
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.680]   Maybe one time and I would have found a provider to work with as well.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.840]   So my hat's off to him.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.840]   It's a great brochure.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.440]   But you as a reader need to know this is a brochure.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.600]   Now if you aren't familiar with reading mutual fund brochures, you probably should
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   read a book like this.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.280]   And I think there will be a lot of good that comes out of this book.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.400]   I really do.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.420]   Because Tony has such a massive footprint.
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:51.320]   He gets people excited about reading books on money, which is fantastic.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.280]   We need lots and lots of people to read books on personal finance.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.120]   And he's very good.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.120]   All the information is really good.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:03.080]   I don't have any problem with any of the data or the facts or even the conclusions
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.200]   that he draws in this entire book.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.580]   I have very few quibbles.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.040]   My quibbles are about style.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.520]   And that's what I want to teach you now in terms of how you obfuscate the truth.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.540]   Just like I'm doing using a word like obfuscate.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:24.260]   You conceal things and you make allegations and you commit logical fallacies because of
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.500]   – just you don't tell the other side.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.220]   Now I don't accuse the author of malice.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.060]   I think he's got a good heart.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.660]   He wants to help people.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.820]   But maybe it's malice and incompetence.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:44.540]   As he says, it's possible to be sincere and to be sincerely wrong.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.340]   And again, he's not wrong.
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.700]   Tony Robbins has great advisors.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.500]   He's got great people.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.740]   I don't think he's wrong.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:55.300]   I just think I hate this like twisted presentation of stuff.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.300]   Let me give you an example.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:03.020]   From page 13, reading here – and let me start on page 12.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.460]   Avoid the Sharks is the title here.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.580]   And you need to know.
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:12.940]   It's possible that I have still a continuing bias because I've come from the financial
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.500]   advisor industry and I have spent so many years getting dumped on.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   It's possible that I'm a little bit more sensitive than the average person to this
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.780]   stuff because it's a very hard industry to work in ethically and uprightly.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.740]   So you should know that about me.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.660]   I think that probably does affect me.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:34.620]   But it just does make me very sensitive to make sure that the information is presented
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.740]   accurately as I understand accuracy.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:41.300]   My third reason for writing this book is that I want to show you how to avoid getting eaten
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.940]   by sharks.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.300]   Stop.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.300]   Psychological technique.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.500]   What has he just done?
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:54.400]   He's labeled his opponent as a shark, which is something that inspires fear.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.260]   He didn't say, "My third reason for writing this book is that I want to show you how to
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.580]   save money and be careful in case you meet an unscrupulous and unethical financial advisor."
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.580]   No.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.540]   He said, "My third reason for writing this book is that I want to show you how to avoid
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.980]   getting eaten by sharks."
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.980]   Fair.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:09.980]   Okay?
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.260]   I'm not using psychologically strong language.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:16.340]   I'm doing the same thing right now by using an emotive, emotionally engaged, intense form
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:20.020]   of communication here where I'm emotionally engaged in my speech.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.020]   No problem.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.700]   Just recognize it for what it is.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:27.340]   If you're reading a book like this, you should write, "Emotional attack," blah, blah, blah,
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:28.780]   labeling your opponent.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.020]   As we'll discuss later, one of the biggest obstacles to achieving financial success is
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:36.860]   the difficulty of figuring out who you can and cannot trust.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.860]   True statement.
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:42.460]   "There are plenty of fantastic human beings working in the financial field, people who
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.060]   always remember their mom's birthday, who are kind to dogs, and who have impeccable
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.180]   personal hygiene."
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.380]   Stop.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.820]   Does any of that have to do with the fact that they're working in the financial field?
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.820]   No.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:59.640]   An accurate statement would be an accurate charitable, magnanimous statement that seeks
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:04.060]   to be conciliatory and give as much benefit to the doubt as possible would be this.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.900]   "There are plenty of fantastic human beings working in the financial field who are hardworking,
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:13.020]   knowledgeable, and care deeply about their client's best interests."
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.220]   But no, the allegation here is they care about their mom's birthday, they're kind to dogs,
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.220]   and have great hygiene.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.140]   "But they're not necessarily looking out for your best interests."
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.660]   True statement.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:30.360]   Most people who you think are providing unbiased financial, in scare quotes, "advice" are actually
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:35.620]   brokers, even if they prefer to go by other titles.
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.620]   Stop.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.180]   Is that true?
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.420]   I don't know whether the first part of that statement is true.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.220]   Most people who you think are providing unbiased financial advice, I don't know that any of
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.900]   us can provide unbiased financial advice.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.900]   I don't think it's possible.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:56.040]   But I'm happy to allow and be generous and say, "Okay, this is a true statement."
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.060]   People are actually brokers, even if they prefer to go by other titles.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.140]   That is true.
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:06.860]   The majority, the vast majority of financial advisors are indeed brokers.
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.860]   Continuing on.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:15.820]   "They make hefty commissions by selling products, whether it's stocks, bonds, mutual funds,
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:21.820]   retirement accounts, insurance, or whatever else might pay for their next trip to the
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:27.100]   Bahamas."
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.220]   The big question here is that somebody's selling whatever they want in order to make their
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.220]   next trip to the Bahamas.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.620]   We're going to come back to that list in a moment.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.620]   Next sentence.
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:41.460]   "As you'll soon learn, only a tiny subset of advisors is legally required to put your
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.340]   best interests ahead of its own."
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:52.500]   That, again, is a textbook non sequitur.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.180]   Statement one is, "They make hefty commissions by selling products, whether it's stocks,
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.140]   bonds, mutual funds, retirement accounts, insurance, or whatever else might pay for
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.820]   their next trip to the Bahamas."
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.820]   That is true.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.520]   "As you'll soon learn, only a tiny subset of advisors is legally required to put your
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.140]   best interests ahead of its own."
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:13.700]   That's also true, but these statements do not necessarily connect because a fiduciary
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:19.260]   advisor who is legally required to put your best interests ahead of its own also sells
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.580]   stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:27.380]   It's just that they have a different compensation structure that allows them to be compensated
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.540]   in the form of fees rather than in the form of commissions.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:38.980]   And also a fiduciary advisor also takes trips to the Bahamas which are paid for from the
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.580]   fees that they earn from their financial planning clients.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:47.500]   So once again, this is all shell games.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:52.260]   But by association rather than any kind of actual evidence presenting something that
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.700]   says, "Here's the number of people that were ripped off.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.700]   Let's talk about that.
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.860]   That would be a good thing to do."
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.980]   After writing Money Master the Game, I saw once again how easy it is to get fooled by
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:01.980]   Wall Street.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.980]   Peter Malik, a certified financial planner and attorney whom I respect tremendously,
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:12.900]   arranged a meeting with me to share what he cryptically described as "some crucial information."
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:17.460]   Okay, what's the crucial information?
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.940]   Let's continue on.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:24.060]   The investment magazine Barron's rated Peter and his company Creative Planning the number
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:31.140]   one independent financial advisor in America in 2013, 2014, and 2015, while Forbes named
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:35.900]   it the top investment advisor in the United States in 2016 based on 10-year growth, and
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:42.380]   CNBC ranked it as the number one U.S. wealth management firm in 2014 and 2015.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.060]   That's a big mouthful, isn't it?
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.260]   Does it have anything to do with the cryptic and crucial information?
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:53.400]   No, but it is an appeal to authority, another logical fallacy.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.420]   The idea is because of somebody's authority, this is why we should listen to them.
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.980]   Now here's – I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:04.200]   I'm a certified – I'm a – I have to say I'm a certified financial planner.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.620]   My license – my certified financial planner – because I didn't finish my CE this year
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.020]   and so I need to catch up and reinstate it.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.840]   I was formerly a certified financial planner, Chartered Life Underwriter, Chartered Financial
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.060]   Consultant, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.060]   What does that mean?
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:23.820]   Well, that means that I have some knowledge that's applicable to the subject matter at
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:24.820]   hand.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:29.220]   But the fact that Peter's company is highly ranked by Barron's and Forbes doesn't have
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.020]   anything to do with the crucial information.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:38.420]   Thus, it's a fallacious appeal to authority, not a proper appeal to authority.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:46.600]   For example, if you need coaching on how to manage a football team and Bill Belichick
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:51.240]   is brought to you, somebody will introduce him to say, "This is Coach Bill Belichick.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:58.440]   He is a winning coach who has won however many Super Bowls and has a huge, tremendous,
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.400]   incredible winning record with football.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   I have no idea.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.520]   I don't watch – I don't care about – I don't watch sports.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.960]   He's a good coach, right?"
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:11.260]   So there you have – the authority is connected to the task at hand and you need help on coaching
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:17.060]   on how to win a football game with regard to how to coach a team.
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:21.700]   Now if somebody brings you and says, "Here, Robert Kraft is the owner of the New England
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:30.220]   Patriots which has won all these Super Bowls," well, Robert Kraft might be able to give you
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:37.180]   good advice and help on how to run a team, how to work with a head coach, but he's probably
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:43.840]   not the person that you want to give advice to you in your actual management of the football
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.840]   game.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.100]   So that's what you got to look out for.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:50.100]   When somebody is trying to establish authority, is the authority relevant to the question
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.380]   being asked?
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.600]   And here, the authority credentials which are bolded about how successful his company
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:02.020]   is, all these things mean that he's had a tremendously successful company.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.060]   That's great.
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.580]   But guess what?
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.940]   Merrill Lynch beats the pants off of him in terms of size.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.660]   Morgan Stanley or whatever it's called now – it's still Morgan Stanley, right?
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.380]   They beat the pants off of him in terms of the size of their company.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.580]   Bank of America is way bigger.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:23.300]   So the appeal to authority here is fallacious because the fact is he's trying to paint
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:29.740]   him as a great guy, but on those terms, the CEO of Bank of America is a far more important
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.540]   person to listen to.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.340]   Continuing on, "When someone with Peter's expertise and reputation reaches out to me,
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.020]   I know that I'll learn something of real value.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:44.020]   Peter flew specially from his home in Kansas to meet me in Los Angeles where I was conducting
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.820]   an Unleash the Power Within event."
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.580]   OK, this is normal.
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.060]   When I want to meet someone, I fly across the country to meet them.
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.980]   This is common, especially when you're Tony Robbins.
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:59.100]   I'll get on the plane tomorrow to do a business deal with you and I'll pay for it myself.
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.940]   You don't have to fly me there.
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.300]   Of course, that's normal.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:11.060]   "It was there that he dropped the bomb, explaining how some 'financial advisors'
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:17.580]   who market themselves as straight shooters were actually exploiting a gray area in the
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.280]   law to sell products that benefited themselves.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.860]   They claim to be fiduciaries, a small minority of advisors who are legally obligated to put
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:29.220]   their clients' interests first.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:36.300]   In reality, they were unscrupulous salespeople who profited by misrepresenting themselves."
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:42.100]   Now, I worked as a professional financial advisor for six years and for the last going
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:46.660]   on 10 years to nine years, I've been in the financial advice industry.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:53.820]   The last four years, three years as a pundit, kind of a public commentator, I guess, and
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:54.820]   six years as an advisor.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.700]   I had no idea what he's talking about.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.980]   I had no idea what he was talking about.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:00.980]   I put this out on Twitter.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.980]   I was like, "Does anyone know what he's talking about?
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.020]   What is he talking about that unscrupulous salespeople are misrepresenting themselves?
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:11.620]   I don't know what they're talking about."
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:17.380]   And a couple of people said, "Well, he's talking about the dual standard and dual registration
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:22.020]   where you're registered as a broker and also registered as a fiduciary advisor."
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.380]   I thought, "Oh, okay.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.380]   That's probably what it is."
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.900]   Well, that's confirmed on page 82.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:35.420]   And I think here we have the fundamental problem with Tony Robbins' money books.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.260]   Here on page 81 and 82, we're right in the middle of a chapter where he's talking about
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.400]   the fiduciary standard.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.460]   I'm going to ignore the chapter on that just for the sake of time and to stay on point.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.860]   I'm not doing a three-hour review of this book.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.500]   I need to do a show on the fiduciary standard.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.780]   But in the middle of the chapter, he talks about dually registered advisors.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:45:00.420]   He says this, "When I first learned about the difference between brokers and registered
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:06.780]   investment advisors, everything seemed so clear and simple to me."
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.940]   Here he's talking about what he wrote about in Money Master the Game.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.800]   "Everything seemed so clear and simple to me.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.720]   You undoubtedly want someone who will act in your best interests, right?
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:19.900]   So it seemed obvious to insist on working with an independent advisor who's legally
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.600]   obliged to act as a fiduciary.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:28.160]   I thought of fiduciaries as the gold standard, but then I discovered that this subject is
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.640]   murkier than I'd realized.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.040]   Here's the problem.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:40.640]   The vast majority of independent advisors are registered as both fiduciaries and brokers."
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.640]   WTF?
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:52.120]   "In fact, as many as 26,000 out of 31,000 RIAs operate in this gray area where they
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.680]   have one foot in both camps.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:03.520]   That's right, only 5,000 of the nation's 310,000 financial advisors are pure fiduciaries.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.420]   That's a measly 1.6%.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:12.480]   Now you know why it's so hard to get unconflicted and transparent advice.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.640]   When I wrote Money Master the Game, I became a champion of fiduciaries only to discover
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:25.560]   this inconvenient truth about dual registration, first brought to me by Peter Malik."
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.040]   Now when I had originally read the previous quote I read from the first chapter, I wrote
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.200]   beside it, "When?
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.620]   When did this meeting happen?"
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.640]   My guess, I don't know the answer, I can't prove it, it's not recorded in the book, my
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.600]   guess is that this meeting happened after he wrote Money Master the Game, but I don't
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.600]   know that, maybe not.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.200]   Maybe it was before when he's editing, I don't know.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.200]   Continuing on, one more paragraph.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:49.200]   "It infuriated me to learn how these dual registrants actually operate.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.760]   One moment they play the part of an independent advisor, reassuring you that they abide by
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   the fiduciary standard and can provide you with conflict-free advice for a fee.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.520]   A second later they switch hats and act as a broker, earning commissions by selling you
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.600]   products.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:10.720]   When they're playing this broker role, they no longer have to abide by the fiduciary standard.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:15.400]   In other words, they're sometimes obliged to serve your best interests and sometimes
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   not.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.880]   How warped is that?"
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:29.280]   That's the silliest analysis of the fiduciary thing that I've ever heard.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.480]   It has to be too strong, I don't know.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.480]   You wanted the show emotional, I try to be very careful with my words.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   It's just so silly.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:44.760]   The fiduciary standard and the suitability standard are legitimate legal problems that
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:53.640]   have to do with ongoing service and the legal requirement on a financial advisor to maintain
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:48:01.920]   a portfolio for the benefit of the client on an ongoing basis.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.320]   It is an important discussion.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:11.240]   I don't have an opinion on it.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.200]   I struggle to know what's right.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:18.040]   When I was a financial advisor, I was a duly registered advisor for the last couple of
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.000]   years when I was still licensed.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.160]   I was registered with my brokerage and I was registered with my advisory company.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:32.320]   I was duly registered as both, but I just always tried to do what's in the best interest
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   of my clients.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.520]   I think most advisors are in the situation.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:41.280]   The problem with the registered investment advisory system is you can't earn commissions
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:48.080]   and some products only pay their income on commissions such as insurance and some products
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:55.040]   only work – and some products are best paid income in the form of commissions.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.600]   That's where the argument is if you're going to – if I were going to provide – one
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.440]   of the arguments that the financial advice industry makes about the fiduciary standard
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.960]   is if you put the fiduciary standard on us across the board, we're not going to work
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:07.960]   with poor people.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   That's true.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.720]   Maybe all those poor people should go to Vanguard, but I would not – I wouldn't – I would
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.240]   not spend any time when I was an advisor.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:23.460]   I would not spend any time servicing somebody who has $50,000 of investable assets if there
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:29.240]   weren't a potential to make a commission of some kind because the revenue into my practice
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.880]   is not worth it.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.300]   It is not worth my time to deal with difficult clients.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.200]   Poor clients are the hardest to work with usually because they're insecure and unconfident
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.880]   for good reason, right?
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.520]   And there's not a lot of potential revenue and you can't do a lot to help them.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:50.120]   It's not like working with an affluent – an affluent business owner has lots of
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.680]   things that you can do to work with to help them.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.400]   So those clients probably should go and it would be great if everyone would just go buy
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.400]   index funds.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.520]   I don't know how to solve that problem.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.240]   I see it from both sides.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.080]   But back to paragraph – or chapter one where he talked about this.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:09.600]   So now I know that was what he was referring to was unscrupulous salespeople.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.600]   It's nothing unscrupulous.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.160]   That's how the business works.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.840]   That's like by definition.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:20.000]   That's how it works.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.080]   They make hefty commissions by selling products.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:32.240]   Listen, whether it's stocks, bonds, those are saleable on commission.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.120]   If you want to buy stocks, you're going to pay a commission, either a very small commission
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:41.440]   to an online brokerage or a commission to a Main Street advisor.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.880]   Most of them don't do that anymore.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:49.320]   But you can only buy stocks and bonds on commission in terms of to have them there.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.800]   You can get advice on them in a registered investment advisory account, yes.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:57.640]   Mutual funds, yes, sometimes sold by brokers, sometimes not.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:02.480]   Mutual funds are not always sold.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   You can go direct to fund and not deal with a commission salesperson.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.600]   Retirement accounts, retirement accounts are not saleable unless we're talking about contracting
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.640]   with a third-party administrator, in which case you're buying something that's – is
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.280]   that – you're buying a retirement account?
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.760]   You can't buy a retirement account.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.360]   Insurance, insurance is always sold with commission.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.320]   I'm not aware – maybe there is someone.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   I'm not aware of any insurance policy still.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.600]   I think I had a listener who commented one time and said there was one, but I checked
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.600]   it out.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.600]   I couldn't figure out whether it was true.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.960]   Insurance, to the best of my knowledge, is always sold on commission.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.560]   So an advisor can't sell insurance.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.540]   There's where we go to wrap up here.
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.960]   So what I did – so this book is a great brochure.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:52.560]   It is brilliant sales brochure for the two companies that Tony has financial – that
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.560]   he's a partner in.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.320]   He's an investor in and a part owner.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:00.720]   The two companies are America's Best, 401(k), and a firm called Creative Planning.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:06.640]   Now America's Best, 401(k) is a company that handles 401(k) accounts.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   I looked them up.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.560]   They are not a registered investment advisory firm.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.080]   They're a service provider in the – at least I couldn't find that they were.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:22.120]   However, they have the identical address as the firm Creative Planning at 3400 College
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.160]   Boulevard, Leawood, Kansas.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.000]   So they're using exactly the same address.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.360]   I haven't researched this beyond this and I'm not going to.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.080]   I just found this, at least this.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.000]   So they are at least connected in some way.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.040]   I don't know if they're the common ownership.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.360]   I couldn't find the information on America's Best, 401(k).
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.560]   So I don't know about common ownership.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.400]   I don't know what the financial interests are of those involved.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:47.280]   Tony does say that he's a partner in America's Best, 401(k), so he's a part owner.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.280]   I don't know if Peter Malik is involved in America's Best, 401(k).
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.920]   I don't know who – what the financial interests are.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.800]   But Creative Planning is a registered investment advisory firm.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.360]   As a registered investment advisory firm, that means that they have what's called a
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.360]   form ADV.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:09.960]   If you want to cut past all the marketing junk on websites, just find the firm's form
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.560]   ADV.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:20.140]   This is the form that gets filed with the regulatory organizations that tells you exactly
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.140]   what's happening.
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.860]   It's a legal document.
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:23.860]   It has to be accurate.
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.320]   It has to be comprehensive.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.360]   It has to say exactly how your business works.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.720]   I know because I wrote one.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.520]   I wrote mine from scratch when I was opening a firm.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:35.560]   So this is the form ADV, Part 2A, the disclosure brochure.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:40.560]   Now here are the key things you need to be aware of, and this is what annoys me, is this
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:49.300]   entire book is trying to paint the industry as unethical, a bunch of charlatans and hooligans
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:53.180]   and sharks.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:58.840]   Page 14, Creative Planning, Inc., form ADV.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:02.400]   I've gone through the different sections here.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.620]   Tony Robbins is listed in the ADV.
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:06.620]   Two things I wanted to say.
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:10.080]   First, let's talk about fees, and then we'll go to page 14.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.120]   Big giant chapter on fees.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.000]   Big deal.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.480]   It's a big deal, not big deal.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.820]   It's a big deal.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:19.820]   It's important.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.880]   Fees are a big deal.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:27.440]   However, the analysis is, "Look, index funds have this tiny expense ratio.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.880]   Vanguard, you can buy a fund with a 0.05% expense ratio."
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.000]   And then later we talk about the value of funds.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.740]   I'm with him on that.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:39.340]   But what annoys me is when people don't talk about the fees for financial planning.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:46.400]   So right here on the material changes, section two of their ADV, update to their annual fee
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:49.440]   calculation for creative planning.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:55.320]   1.20% on the first $500,000.
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:55:04.200]   1% on assets of $500,000 to $2 million.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.680]   That's exactly what I used to charge when I used to do this business.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:15.280]   0.85% for $2 million to $5 million of assets, 0.8, and it goes on from there.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:20.160]   The point is this, fees matter, and we should be very careful with fees.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.400]   But don't use as your...
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.680]   It's a straw man comparison.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.920]   There's another logical fallacy.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:28.760]   "Well, look, index funds are really cheap, but you should go and choose creative planning."
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.200]   I'm with you.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:36.000]   Good index funds are valuable in a portfolio, but don't compare 0.05% and ignore the fact
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.200]   that we're also going to be paying financial planning fees.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.000]   Financial advisors should earn their money.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:49.520]   If you don't think they can earn their money, you shouldn't hire them.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:53.640]   But don't use straw man arguments to make false comparisons.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:58.300]   At least if you're going to talk about fees, talk about comparable fees between different
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.960]   advisory firms.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:03.000]   Page 14, and I'm done with this review.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.080]   Insurance activities through creative planning risk management, creative planning benefits,
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.960]   and creative planning property and casualty LLC.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:15.600]   Remember, anytime when you run an RIA, your ADV has to reflect any forms of compensation.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:21.280]   Now, Robbins just spent all this time talking about the sharks and how working with a fee-only
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:25.680]   advisor is the only way to go, and fees are the only thing, and commissions can't be paid.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:31.320]   And I maintain this is an important discussion, but it's a red herring.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.300]   Ah, another logical fallacy.
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:37.680]   It's a red herring because it's trying to indicate that somehow you can do it without
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:41.400]   paying commissions, and you can't.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.680]   Creative planning has three related insurance agencies.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:50.200]   This is what you have to do, is you have to set up a separate insurance agency as a separate
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:57.720]   entity, and you have to collect your fees through the context of that insurance agency,
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:02.000]   your commission, sorry, your commissions in that insurance agency so you don't mess up
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.840]   your RIA.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.960]   Creative planning has three related insurance agencies.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:12.120]   Creative planning risk management provides individual life, disability, and long-term
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.780]   care coverage through various insurance companies.
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:20.400]   Creative planning benefits provides group health benefits through various insurance
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.520]   companies.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:29.600]   Creative planning property and casualty LLC provides property and casualty coverage.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:37.760]   Agents of creative planning may be referred to a related insurance agency.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.280]   Creative planning does not receive a referral fee.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:52.600]   However, some of creative planning's personnel that are insurance agents may receive commissions
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:58.120]   for the sale of insurance products.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   The receipt of insurance commissions is in addition to any advisory fees charged by creative
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.520]   planning.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:14.840]   Employees of the insurance agencies may refer clients to creative planning.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:21.800]   In these cases, creative planning will pay a referral fee by paying the insurance company
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:30.040]   up to 20 basis points, which is .20% of the total fee charged by creative planning to
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.680]   the client.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:38.080]   Please refer to item 14, client referrals and other compensation.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.200]   Clients are never obligated or required to purchase insurance products from one of our
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:45.720]   affiliated insurance companies and may choose any independent insurance agent and insurance
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.880]   company to purchase insurance products.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.140]   Regardless of the insurance agent selected, the insurance agent or agency will receive
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.080]   normal commissions from the sale.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.960]   Please refer to item 14, client referrals and other compensation.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.640]   For more information, you get the point.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.360]   The point is this.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.360]   This is a bunch of...
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.040]   I hate to use the word crap.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.240]   I really do.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.440]   I don't know of another word.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.400]   Yeah, some of you thought I was going to...
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.400]   No.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.400]   I hate the word...
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.400]   I try not to use...
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.400]   I'm trying...
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:18.660]   Worked very hard to purge the word crap, but it's hard to have another word that expresses.
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:25.200]   We just spent a whole bunch of pages in a book talking about how, in your words, duly
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:31.760]   registered advisors are unethical and they're misrepresenting themselves, basically accused
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.100]   of misrepresentation, which is one step short of lying.
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:37.140]   What a load of crap.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.540]   Creative planning does exactly the same thing.
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:45.360]   They just have set it up on an entity level instead of with the individual advisor.
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:48.160]   I have no idea how many of their advisors are duly registered here.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.760]   I don't know.
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.020]   But it's a bunch of shell game.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:57.840]   The problem is the stupid regulations in the financial industry that lead to this stuff.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:01.800]   Most financial advisors that I have known don't care how they're compensated.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.480]   A bunch of them are charlatans.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:07.720]   Yes, I have all kinds of beefs to pick with the financial advisor industry, but this is
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:17.740]   the wrong way to represent it because it's...
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.300]   You get the point.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.360]   Here's what I would do if I were you.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.640]   If you're new to financial books, read Unshakable if you like it.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.100]   If you like Tony Robbins, great.
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:28.240]   Read Unshakable.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:35.600]   Tony Robbins has access, because of his status, he has access to the world's greatest leading
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.000]   minds on this subject.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.520]   That makes these books worth the price of admission.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.200]   I bought this thing on pre-order.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:46.440]   I pre-ordered it when I saw that it came out because I knew it would be a big deal and
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:50.200]   I forgot about it and it showed up on my mailbox.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:55.660]   These things are worth the price of admission because of the quotes and because of the access
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:58.260]   that he has.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.840]   He's also brilliant at conveying concepts.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.840]   You should read them.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.580]   If you care about money, you should read it because the man is a master of psychology.
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:06.820]   That's really good.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:11.720]   If you've not been exposed to this stuff before, you should read this book in order to be exposed
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.920]   to the conflicts and the things, problems in the financial advice industry.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:20.120]   But more than anything, my encouragement to you is twofold.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.960]   Once again, I sound like a broken record.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:28.520]   Once again, study what people do, not what they say.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.180]   Here's what Tony Robbins says in chapter two.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:37.400]   He says, "Our capacity for pattern recognition is also the number one skill that can empower
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.000]   us to achieve financial prosperity.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.480]   Once you recognize the patterns in the financial markets, you can adapt to them, utilize them,
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.480]   and profit from them."
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.480]   Nonsense.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:54.240]   "The number one skill that you can develop to achieve financial prosperity is the skill
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.440]   of earning a lot of money by building a massive business and income.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.640]   That's the biggest thing."
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:08.440]   Page 26, "The single best place to compound money over many years is the stock market."
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.440]   Nonsense.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:17.640]   The single best place to compound money over many years is in your own massive and growing
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:22.280]   business, because that's what Tony Robbins did.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.840]   I don't deny that he has a lot of money in the stock market.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.980]   I don't deny that the stock market can be great, but that is not what's going to make
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:35.040]   you a mega, mega millionaire with a private jet and a house in Sun Valley, Idaho, and
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.520]   a house in Palm Beach, Florida.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.320]   You cannot get there from here.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:47.720]   You cannot put aside 10 or 15 or 20% of your income and be really, really wealthy the way
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.720]   that Tony teaches.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:54.080]   What you need to do is skip this stuff and go take his mastery courses, because there
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.040]   he pulls apart the business, business mastery, and all of his other stuff.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.520]   That's the stuff that matters.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:07.100]   The man started off completely broke, raised by a single mom in poverty, and he's transformed
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:15.440]   himself into a mega, mega millionaire, but it wasn't because of investing in stocks.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:20.480]   It was because he worked his tail off for years.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.160]   He established a reputation.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:28.960]   He chose a business that has massive leverage opportunities.
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.540]   He played to his strengths.
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.980]   He became the best in the world at what he's good at.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:40.120]   He built a huge business that he took public, which diversified his risk asset allocation,
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.760]   but not in the way that it's taught in the book.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:48.360]   He built a huge business that he took public, built a massive lifestyle and still keeps
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.360]   part of it.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.360]   I'm sure.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.400]   I don't know what his arrangements are, but keeps plenty of it to make money.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:59.640]   He's engaging along the way in more businesses by partnering with other people who are experiencing
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:07.120]   the benefits of asymmetric risk and reward, which are the people running the businesses
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:14.160]   like Creative Planning and America's Best 401(k).
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:20.040]   Don't listen to what he says other than to do what he says with a percentage of your
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.960]   wealth, which is what he would do.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.960]   He'll probably, I don't know.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:23.960]   I have no idea.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.920]   There's no way that I could know, but let's say that 15 or 20% of his wealth is in stocks.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:29.920]   Great.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.000]   He's got a great advisor.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.960]   I think that's really smart, but he also owns a resort in Fiji and he has interest in all
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.700]   these different companies.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:43.040]   That's where the money comes from and that's where I would put my life savings on a bet.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:48.880]   I would put my life savings on a bet that the vast majority of his money is invested
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:59.880]   in his own private enterprises, not in publicly traded New York Stock Exchange listed stocks.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.880]   Sure he has some money there, but man, I would fall off my chair if it were more than 25
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.880]   or 30% of his wealth.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.240]   I really would.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:15.320]   It's hard for me to imagine it being more than 20%.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:23.360]   That's what frustrates me about this whole stupid personal finance business.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:27.680]   That's what frustrates me is nobody tells the truth.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.760]   Now I'm not accusing him of being a liar.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.760]   Hear me clearly.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:36.480]   I'm just saying, watch what he does and go take his business mastery stuff.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.320]   Skip this stuff.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:43.680]   Finally, watch what he's done with the sale of this book.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:49.400]   He built a huge, huge platform.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:53.600]   You've seen this man's face everywhere in the last month.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:06:01.440]   If you pay any attention to this, he has a team behind him that is second to none, that
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:09.480]   gets him on every single media outlet and he's brilliant at it.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.640]   He markets the book.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.360]   Look how he markets the book.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:18.360]   He markets the book as knowledge, which is true.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.360]   Books are going to be one of your best investments you can make.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.840]   They're so packed and they're so cheap to buy if you read them.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.220]   He markets the book.
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:34.640]   As he's marketing the book, he talks about the fact that he's not profiting from the
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.080]   book.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.920]   This is a big deal.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.320]   Right in the front of it, find it.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.200]   I can't find it.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.240]   He markets right in the front where he's giving away all the profits of the book to feed hungry
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.240]   families.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.440]   That is great.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.820]   But notice what he's doing.
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:51.980]   Notice the tax planning.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:55.240]   Royalties from the sale of a book create income.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.900]   He doesn't need more income right now.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:00.420]   What he does need is tax deductions.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:04.860]   By earning the royalties from the sale of the book and giving it all away, he creates
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:09.160]   a charitable tax deduction to offset his other forms of income.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.720]   But what he does is from the sale of the book, he profits from the sale of the book because
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:20.040]   it's a brochure which sends clients to his other firms and which attracts other clients
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.840]   to his other businesses.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.360]   In those other firms, he's a partner who has an equity stake.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.720]   His equity grows in value because the firm grows in value.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:35.840]   He doesn't realize any income, so he pays no current taxes on the growth of those assets.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.920]   He can defer those taxes over time.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   Why?
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:46.560]   That's because taxes matter as he talks about in section 2 where he talks about the core
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.560]   four.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.560]   Taxes matter.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:54.080]   So notice what he's doing to plan for taxes which is donate the charitable income from
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:58.040]   the royalties – donate the royalties of the book as charitable income because that's
