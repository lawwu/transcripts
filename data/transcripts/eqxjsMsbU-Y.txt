[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480]   - Did OpenAI just get caught with their hand
[00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.120]   in the cookie jar or the training data cookie jar?
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.440]   OpenAI's CTO was interviewed
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.760]   by the Wall Street Journal this week.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.040]   - What data was used to train Sora?
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.740]   - We used publicly available data and licensed data.
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.820]   - So videos on YouTube?
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.180]   - I'm actually not sure about that.
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.080]   - You got to think the CTO of an organization
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.760]   whose job it is to build models based on training data
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.840]   knows where the training data is from.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.360]   My interpretation of that answer is that she is hesitating
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.520]   'cause she doesn't want to make a statement against interest.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.560]   I don't know if I would say that she's lying per se,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.960]   but I think she's probably concerned
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.000]   that if she comes right out and answers the question
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.900]   as directly as she could, that it could be a problem
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.600]   for them in all these lawsuits that they're now facing.
